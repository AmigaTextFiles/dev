  Wading through usenet news the other day I came across a posting that
mentioned a Blitz Basic mailing list.
 I gather this is the right address for that list so could you please add me
to it ?

 Mail address is chris@ragman.demon.co.uk



 Thanx in advance

Could someone please explain the concept of "Bitmaps" and "Slices" to me.
I'm having a hard time understanding the explanations given in the BB2 docs.
Also, does anyone know of some good books (in English) where I can get 
information about programming graphics.  

Thanks in advance

Hi y'all,

	Just a quick note to say that there is another library currently in
development. It's called the TrackDisk-Lib and contains commands to
read/write sectors from a disk - if you dont want people to rip stuff
from your programs (e.g. shape files/IFFs/modules etc.), you
can write them to unused sectors of a disk and voila, its safe.
It currently contains the following commands :

	OpenDisk unit#
	CloseDisk unit#
	MotorOn unit# 				; not really necessary
	MotorOff unit#
	ReadSector unit#,sector#,buffer[,numsectors]
	WriteSector unit#,sector#,buffer[,numsectors]
	FormatTrack unit#,track#,buffer[,numtracks]

I'm not really sure if its worth continuing this library - after all it has
limited use, but if you want it, then just tell me.

Steve.

Has anybody else had problems displaying HAM8 pictures on a BLitz display?  On
mine the palette seems to be corrupted and looks very crap.  When DPaint saves
out Ham8 pictures it saves out 256 colour entries, does this mean that DPaint
colour splits the display?  Or does it mean something else?  Also there are
loads of wierd chunks in an HAM8 IFF file - what do these chunks do?  Does
anybody out there know?

Thanx in advance.....

Hi there!

I live in Sweden and I've just received the july issue of AF. I think that it's
ridiculous how they have handled the competition. In the paper there is only a couple
of lines stating the winners names. No screenshots or anything. I think that if they
(Acid) wanted more people to buy BB2 then they should have shown several of the
best entries. If people see what can be done with this brilliant language I'm sure
they will also buy it.  

 When I spoke to AF about the competition a couple of months ago they
said that they had received some very good stuff. It's a shame that no one outside the small(?)
bb2 community will ever see them.

Greetings from

Having trouble displaying 64 bit sprites on an AGA (A1200) machine.
I am using the some code that looks something like this:

   Loadshape
   Spritemode 2
   Getasprite
   Displaysprite
   
The sprite will display but it is not 64 bits wide. I am using a 
64 x 64 shape that I created in D-paint.
 
If anyone has any additional information for using sprites on AGA
machines I could really use some help.

Sounds very interesting steve 8)

Has anybody considered writing libraries which do a similar job to 
LoadShapes, LoadSounds, etc, except supporting compression. Although 
this would leave the files in their original state on the diskdrive, 
the files would be compressed so people wouldn't be able to touch 
them (maye build in a decription key value too).

Hi all,

Firstly to Steve, hows the mapeditor coming? I haven't had an update 
for a while. Did you fix the disappearing block problem, since thats 
the only thing stopping me from using it at the mo (plus the shape 
select crash).

Now a question of copyright. Is it okay for me to distribute 
Commodore's Installer application with my game. I supply an installer 
script for installation onto a harddisk, but there may be many people 
who don't have installer.

Of course, people who have it already may not like downloaded another 
copy of a program they have already, but I cannot please everybody 
all of the time 8)

What do you all think is the best approach?

Hi,

With the release of BUM7 soon, can you (Acid) tell me if the debugger 
is fixed so it works on accelerated machines. I've basically written 
half my game without the aid of a debugger because the bloody thing 
is so unstable.

Also, any chance of the sfx corruption (on accelerated machines) bug 
being fixed?????

> Ya hello Martin,
hi 8)

> Debugger bad on accelerators?
Very bad.

> Any points in particular? 

Well, recently (about a month ago), I started getting errors when 
examining variables. Sometimes it would work fine, sometimes when I 
asked to see an existing variable, it would say 'cannot create in 
direct mode', even tho the variable definitely exists!

Also, when my program reached a certain size I think (although I may 
be wrong in that), when running my game in debugging mode, the game 
crashes at random intervals, usually no more than 30 secs after it 
starts. No feedback at all, it simply crashes my machine. 
Of course, my game runs fine in non-debug mode (not a single crash), 
but as soon as I switch to debug mode, random crashes.

I read in bum6 that unlnk a4 statements should be placed at the end 
of asm statements/functions. Is this still correct?

I can believe it 8) Is SkidMarks being updated at all. I wish for 
greater computer intelligence, since I have yet to lose a match 
against the computer, and I usually lap them once or twice (they are 
aweful drivers) 8^)

Very nice. Is this sound patch a small thing? You see, I'm releasing 
my game in the next couple of days. Is it possible for me to make 
this patch myself, since the sound bug takes a lot of gloss off my 
game.

Cheers

Yep, I have bum6 (blitz v1.8).

Was I correct in just moving the unlnk a4 command to the end of the 
asm statements in my code (just before the return)? If so, then I 
suppose theres nothing more I can do. 8(

Is the debugger due for an overhaul in the near future? I cannot 
forsee myself carrying on with the language much further if as 
important tool as the debugger is not functioning at all.

Over the net would be fantastic. Unfortunately I seem to be rather 
good at SkidMarks, since I cannot find anybody who can beat me. This 
removes a lot of fun from the game, as you can imagine. (Any chance 
of a hd installable version in the future?)

I haven't tried turning my caches off to be honest, but while I could 
do that for my machine, I obviously cannot do that on other people's 
machines, they would kill me 8)

what do you mean by execute_ call? I don't have the blitz manuals in 
front of me now, so I can't look it up. What does it do?

Let me just add that, although I'm complaining a lot in these 
letters, its great to see Acid Software on internet at last. In fact, 
my previous two letters got responses from you within 10-15 minutes, 
hows that for service ! 8)

A competiton on internet, in which people race and enter times, and 
the winner is the person who has the most points at the end of the 
season is the winner.

> 3. did you not get the runerrs off and on message I posted?
Yep, I'll try it tonight (I'm at work you know). Sounds like a hack 
to me tho.

> 4. yeh 10 minute turn arounds is kind of bizarre, do you evver work?
Yep of course 8). But my c compiler is busy in the background, 
leaving me lots of time.

Did you know Ted is very flaky with very large files. Two weeks ago, 
it destroyed my main source file (which was about 4500 lines of 
code). It just ate it up and spat out a 650K file full of binary 
junk.

I've know split my game source up into smaller pieces, and things are 
working smoothly, but I wasn't pleased at the time.

Also, does anybody from Acid Software care to comment on that Amiga 
Format competition. I'd like to hear the reasons why that crap Circus 
game won? 8)

I Know!!!!  Just get rid of the reference to VW-Types.res from the compiler
options...Its from my Virtual Worlds prog, and I sort of forgot to remove
t before uploading - whoops   ;}

Those libs have been slightly updated now (the textEntry one actually),
but Im off home today and dont have a chance to upload them myself - I will
be mailing to someone who can upload the updates for me, but that may take
 week or two....Ill be back on line in October.  Thanx to all those who have
offerred to do that uploading...

If anyone is really desperate/cant access ftp/whatever, send me a disk and sae
and Ill mail you the stuff.  Mail to the address below.

They should be updated on aminet (dev/basic/VS-Includes.lha) within 2 weeks -
I WILL try!!!  For the moment tho` they do work - just remove the reference.

Seeyall in October - And Hi to Simon - FINALLY!!!!

SIMON : Can U believe it - I STILL dont even have BUM6 - Ive contacted the
lace in the uk several times and they _STILL_ wont send me anything!!!!
Maybe I should try again (and again... and  again...)

Hi Mark,
 
If (during the summer) you want me to upload stuff to aminet for you,
or you want me to desperately grab something for you, send me the 
disks and I will do the business.

That sounds fantastic, I'll anxious to see it. I'll give it a 
thorough testing for you, don't you worry. I've described the program 
to my graphics friend (doing the graphics for my game), and hes 
failing over himself with excitment 8)

Oh, my shootemup game 8) Yeah, the demo is finished now, I'll be 
uploading it to aminet later on. I'd mail it to you but I cannot, as 
you know. Its called StarWoids. Mostly bug free, except some sound 
and memory bugs which I think are blitz problems, and I can't seem to 
get rid of them. 8(

Yeah, mail it, people would be stupid to complain about blitz libs 
being posted, they are the life of the language! Anim7. 8) That 
sounds excellent, I could definitely make use of that in my game (the 
release version) I think.

Delta compress? Hmm, I think a separate library for that could be 
useful. Yeah, on the face of it, that would be excellent.

Have you considered developing some libs to support compressed and 
encripted sounds/graphics etc, and maybe the bundling of lots of iff 
pics into one file? I would kill for something like that! 8)

> Write back soon.....

Unfortunately, my reply comes via the blitz-list again, when is your 
mail system due for a revamp????

Hi Steve:

I think you should continue with the track lib because I for one
think it's great to be able to save data onto disk tracks instead
of the normal file method of saving. Know what i mean?

Also, will you libs be able to allow us to save our programs onto
the tracks also (i.e. make NON-DOS disk games) ? That would also be
great!

Mr. Mig

Just to let you all know, I'm planning on making a Blitz version
of Jeopardy!  (Or did I already mention that?)  Well, I think
it would be a great practice project for me for my first Blitz 2
program.  What do you guys think?  I'vre already done a couple of
routines, and they are turning out great!  I'm planning on
digitizing graphics and sound directly from the show itself, so
hopefully it will interest you guys enough to Download it! hehe!

Also, maybe I can ask something of you.  I am trying to figure out
what the best way of making something zoom in, for example, the
screen for the Daily Double on Jeopardy!  You know? It starts of small
and it flips around on the x-axis while coming closer and closer to
the screen, until it occupies the whole screen.  What's the best way
to do the zooming part to make it look ultra smooth?

Mr. Mig

Just a Quick bug report:

Library: Gadtools
Problem: For Gadtools displayed aprox 40bytes of memory is lost when the
         program exits. (Although listviews seem to take up 160 bytes)
         This memory is not released even if a Free GTLIST xx is issued.

         When I recompiled the GTLIB from BUM5 and replaced the BUM6 Version
         the problem is removed.

Example: If the BUM6 GTDEMO is compiled and made executable it will show a
         memory drain when run multiple times. Recompile using the BUM5
         version of GTLIB and the problem is removed.

Fix:     I will have a look at the code see if I can see any problems,
         although my assember is a bit rusty these days, If anyone has
         already seen the problem (& fixed it) let me know and I'll leave
         it alone.!

BUG! BUG! BUG!

I don't like that shape editor that comes with Blitz ][.  Anyone
ever have any problems with it?  I grabbed about 60 or so shapes
and whenever I get to shape # 56, it says there is no cookiecut for
this shape!  GAK!  What's going on here?  How can I finish my Jeopardy!

Are there any other shape grabbers anywhere?  Hope so.

It seems like Acid is with us here on the list finally - hooray and welcome 8).
As a little test I will now ask a question.
<Question>
I have an A2000(WB 1.3) and are currently planning to upgrade to WB 3.1. Will I still be able
to use BB2 or will I run into some incompability?

Hi all!

I know that there have been some discussion about this blitz
sound problem...and yes I know that it will work fine with this cache 
off thing (which is not the solution of course). So what I'm 
interested in is next:
* Will there be any replacement libs from Acid (Simon?)?
* Maybe there are some user made libs?
* Is ther any possible way to handle this thing in asm (though
  i've noted that things U write in asm (in blitz) will 78.4% crash :(
  
  So does anybodu know anything about this?? I just don't want to 
release my mega project because of crapped sounds!!

Try Paul Reece's library when it's finished, it's good!

To Steve,

Thanks for the mapeditor, I'll give it a good bashing over the next 
day or so and let you know the results.

By the way (to all I suppose), my latest blitz game StarWoids is 
finished (well the demo anyway), and will be available at all good 
ftp sites in the next day or so.

Actually, I'm setting up my own ftp site right now, which should be 
active later today. I'll mail the list once its ready for access.

Hi all,

Just to announce that the demo of my latest blitz game StarWoids is 
now released. It should be available on an ftp site near you soon, 
but its now available on my own anonymous ftp site at the following 
address:

   cekift.swan.ac.uk

This site may be unavailable at some times of the day, so if you 
can't get through, please try again later.

This site is unmonitored, so please treat it with respect. If you 
have any blitz demos etc which you wish to give me, then feel free to 
drop them in my account (with an associated text file).

Cheers

X-Status: 
Status: RO

I am using the version that came with the amiga format-

but it does not seem to do anything much on my 3000 except crash when I try
and complie & run the simplest program.

It manages to open the blitz cli window then it locks up my machine.

It also claims to never have enough memory to compile a little tiny
program- how can I tell it to take more, I hvae 26 megs of ram free!!

Also, I would like to get a real version & manual- but I am having a hard
time getting it in the USA.  ACID---> who distributes for you all over
here?

Will the amiga format version work in ntsc, or do i need to be in pal?!?!

help- trying to determine if i want the whole package ( i'm sure I do!),

Yep steve,

I did manage to logonto your account 8)

I did have my server switched off for a few mins this morning, so 
maybe you tried to logon in that time. Try again and see if it works 
now.

If it doesn't, I can drop StarWoids into your account for you 8)

(P.S. We could use this method of exchanging letters and code you 
know, better than blitzlist 8)

	Well I here there are over 100 users of this list including
		the creator himself.

	So surely someone can answer the question I have asked before!!!


	How can I reuse the same sprite channel to display another image
		further down the screen (with at least 1 pixel margin).

	This is the whole idea of sprites reusing the same sprite channel
		to display multiple sprites down the screen.

			Heres hoping for an answer

Hi Folks,
	I am having problems with ILBMInfo
Every time it is used it takes the complete size of the image and does not
give it back. Also I think it loads the complete image in as well. Not
good for CD32 work.
I thought I might have a look at the header of the image file and get all
the info I need.
Here is the start of the idea.
However where is the ViewMode info?

There is something I am having problems with.  CopyBitmap! Here is
the situation:

I have 2 screens.  Exactly the same dimensions, each with Bitmaps
that also are alike.  I use the command:
    CopyBitmap 0,1
and I view screen 1 to see what hapenned.  It copied screen 0, but
it became all messed up!  It was not positionned properly, there
was some junk at the bottom.  What could make it do that? I
can't figure it out.  Please help.

Hello there,
	    OK I have started writing another game, and guess what? It is
quite original!!! Never seen it done anyway. I will send a demo on later, but
I have a problem with the level editor I am writing for it...

	The screen I open (using ScreenTags) is 320x1024. The mouse pointer
will not go down further than y coordinates 681! This make some of the operations
of the editor VERY difficult. So OK I thought, I will set the autoscroll tag
to true, but no joy, no autoscroll. I guess it has something to do with the 
display clip region, but eery time I try and allocate this structure (a real
simple one too) I get a guru!!! Why I have no idea. Does anyone have a bit
of source they can mail me, or let me know how I can get the pointer to go 
below 681? 

	While I am here, I am getting close to completing the second version
of ShapeZ, my shape editor/cutter/manipulator utility. I have basically made
it much more robust than the last version, and now I want to add a load of
features, one of which is a simple set of drawing tools to edit the currently
loaded IFF and a suite of tools for editing shapes, is this a good idea or do
you just want to set it up in a proper painting package lke Dpaint or 
Brilliance? 
	
	Ho hum, roll on BUM7 and a few bug fixes for BB2, keep up the good work
Acid, it's been fun so far. (Don't think of them as bugs, more as a challenge!!)

	You can get the old version of shapeZ from Aminet, it is in one of Mikos
archieves.

Hello fellow Blizers,

I am currently creating a text editor for an Amiga guide generator. So far
I have the basic text editor built. The problem is that when I load a one
thousand line text file it takes 3 to 5 minutes on an Amiga 500. I currently
use an edit(1024) to read a line in at a time. As you can see this time is 
unacceptable so I experimented to see how quickly I could count the number 
of lines (load the file in the buffer and search for asc 10) and found I 
could do this in less than one second. 

Since I can determine where each line end I would like to know how to create
a string that is compatable with blitz strings. For example I know
that the first workd of a Blitz string is the size and that the last Character
is a null character. What I don't know is how do I place a string in a string
variable? Do I need to allocate memory or are all strings allocated to the
max string size (I don't think so). Also, is there a way to access the internal
sting buffer as this could speed up the creation of a string.

Thanks For your help

Mark.

Hiya guys,

I have some strange problems with the Serial commands. I can't even 
open a port!

I use this: OpenSerial "ser:",0,9600,0

When I run it I get a Syntax Error, so when I press help I get:
 OpenSerial device$,unit#,baud,io_serflags
 
What's wrong???????????????????????

Hi Jurgen,

>I use this: OpenSerial "ser:",0,9600,0
I think you are confusing what is meant by device$. What it actually means
is the system device which you are opening to talk to the serial port, (erm,
not really making myself clear am I :-(  time for an example)

It should be
           ok=OpenSerial("serial.device",0,9600,0)
(warning, the name of the device is case sensitive !)

Or possibly
           ok=OpenSerial("BaudBandit.device",0,9600,0)
if you have baudbandit to control your serial comms.

Here's a working example

                  ok=OpenSerial("serial.device",0,9600,0)
                  If ok
                    NPrint "Yippee It worked"
                  Else
                    NPrint "Oh Bugger, no it didn't"
                  End If
                  ClickMouse
                  CloseSerial 0

Hope this make things clearer..

Hi Steve,

I finally got around to testing the recent version of the mapeditor 
you sent me at the start of the week (sorry for the delay), but I 
have run into major problems.

When I run it, select create map, then supply the shapes filename, it 
pops up with a nifty dialog box whilst loading the shapes, and then I 
press okay when its finished. Now however, the mapeditor is hung. The 
system doesn't crash or anything, but the mapeditor doesn't respond 
to any menu selections, mouse or keyboard presses etc 8(

Help!

After releasing my game last week, I've had a few problems reported 
by people who are running on ntsc machines which baffle me.

Firstly, I have in my code a section which calls CloseWorkbench, and 
it does this in a loop of 50, which I took from lots of blitz 
examples, including the Acid defender game I think.

However, on some machines, this causes workbench to close, reappear, 
close, reappear 50 times until it finally closes down and the game 
starts!!!! 8(

Also, on some machines, when my game opens up a PAL screen to run the 
game, when it closes down, it leaves wb in PAL mode, and doesn't 
return to ntsc mode in which wb was originally.

I don't see either of these two problems on my machine, even when I 
run in many wierd screen modes like multisync or super72.

Can anybody help me?

Hi,

Yep, it's me again. I hooked up a PC with a terminal program to my
Amiga with a nullmodem cable. 

Try this one:

WbStartup

If OpenSerial("serial.device",0,9600,0)
    WriteSerialString 0,"Now testing..."
    SerialClose 0
Else
    Nprint "Can't open Serial.Device"
End
MouseWait:End

The only thing that happend is that the first 2 letters of the string
appears on the screen (of the PC).

I tried my terminal program I ever wrote in A**S and it worked great! 
No problems at all. What the hell am I doing wrong????????

Maybe somebody from Acid has a idea?

P.S.

I tried using the SetSerialLens commands, but it doesn't change 
anything to my problems...

Hear'ya, I hope....

Well I found a solution to my problem. I have to put a Vwait in my
listing before sending the string. This works....

I think your closing the serial.device too soon and not giving enough time for
the string to be sent.  Move CloseSerial to the end of your program.

Hi all,

I am in desperate need of somehow getting my blitz game to boot into 
a pal screen (it uses blitz mode and slices). Currently, if the game 
is run on true NTSC screens, my game opens up slices which are pal in 
height but nevertheless NTSC screens.

Although I'm considering adding true NTSC support to my game, in the 
mean-time I want to force the game to use PAL, regardless of the 
resolution that workbench is running at (if I don't all the timing is
seriously screwed).

Since I could see no option in the slice command to do this, I 
tracked down a function called ForcePal. However, this is 
unsatisfactory since it seems a tade unrealiable, and it sometimes 
seriously fucks up when exiting my game back to WB, especially when 
WB is running in nopal resolutions, with a number of other apps 
running on their own private screens.

It looks like ForcePal shunts the entire system over the PAL (I may 
be wrong), whereas all I really want is to open up my own 
slice/screen in true PAL mode.

Is this possible (I hope so)???????????????????????

I am trying to find a way to save variable data to disk.
Right now I am doing it the old fashioned way...
my variable is variable(20,20)
I use a loop to write it to a file sequentially.
CanDo allows for saving a variable and I was wondering if there was a way 
to achieve this with BB because reading just a 20,20 array is taking
too long.
Actually...saving isn't as important speed wise as is reading the data.

Hi All!

I just got my Blitz 2 package and have some questions for you:

Where is the Intuition Planner they keep talking about? Was it on a BUM?
I couldn't find it in my package. I want it!!!

How do you subscribe to BUMs? How much is it? Per year or what? There was
no info at all in my package about this. I got BUM 1-5 in compressed
format.

Is the address for sending the registration card still valid? Mine says:
Acid Software, Unit 15, Guildhall Ind. Est., Kirk Sandall, Doncaster, South
Yorkshire, DN3 1 QR.

Thanks in advance!

Hi everybody,

             I am a new user of this list. I have followed this list a couple
off days and must say i'm impressed. I hope i can ask here some couple off
questions i am wondering about a hole time. 

But first some information of me.

I have buyed blitz some time ago and i love to work with it. I'm 25 years young
and have followed the Amiga since the first A500 came out. First trying to find
my way in AmigaBasic but i have to put this in the trahcan very soon. Then
Hisoft-Basic cames out. But after a while with the new 2.+ roms i have to put
that in the  trashcan to.;-) 

And now with BlitzII a hole new World opens. Thanx to the creators ! I have 
currently a A2000 + 9 meg + 2.1 rom + Turbo 68030 25 Mhz + a GVP controler with
syquest 105 meg and a Quatum 105 meg. Recently i have A1200 to, with 50 meg AT
HD 3.5inch for just testing on 3.0 and AGA.

Currently i am working on a filerequester voor points ! Not some easy requester
but a hole program of recently 150kb that takes a lot work off a point out his
hands.;-) So, you see i am more interested in the Blitz Amiga modes. I think to
upload this prog in one mond, if everything comes right !

It's the first time i am using E-mail, and hope everything i am doing now is
fine. So, if somebody would confirm this, i presiate it. Thanx !

Nice one, but do you have to Vwait everytime you send a string ?

I resorted to sending strings one byte at a time using WriteSerial instead,
as this seemed to be much more reliable.

Watch out for the ReadSerial bug (I've described the fix in an earlier
message, but if anyone needs the fix, let me know). For those that don't
know the ReadSerial command returns a byte instead of a word so, if you send
a char(255) into blitz the command reports it as -1 (ie. no data waiting)
even if you take the advice and assign the result to a .w variable.

Appologies if people have this message twice, it didn't appear to get to the
list first time round.

Well, no one answered my last message about Screen Copying.  Fine.
So, let's see if anyone is nice enough to answer this one:

True or False: You NEED a Screen in order to have a Bitmap.

If this is FALSE, then I am lost, please explain WHY it's false.

If this is TRUE, then I'm on track, but how do I inhibit the user
from pressing Left-Amiga-M to switch screens?  BLITZ mode right?
But in Blitz mode, we can't use screens, or bring other screens
to the front of the display etc...  So how do I go about it?

Can somebody tell me why this crashes my computer total and even a
reset doesn't work?

If OpenFile(0,"s:startup-sequence")
    Maxlen in$,30
    Fields 0,in$
    Get 0,0
    DefaultOutput
    Nprint in$
    CloseFile 0
EndIf
MouseWait:End

If I do this with a program (I tried diskmaster II) it seems to 
work.....

I want to make a simple program what uses a string variabel as a 
buffer for copying a file, somebody made it allready????

Cya

Hiya.  Well, the only thing that I can see wrong with this program
is in the second line 'Maxlen in$,30' should be 'Maxlen in$=30'.
One other thing that I'm concerned about is openning a text file as
a random access file.  Shouldn't you use sequencial access? Try it
out, this little program should not be that much of a problem.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello all.  Can someone please tell me why this program isn't working?

BLITZ

QAMIGA
If ReadFile(0,"Ram:Test")
  FileInput 0
  Hello$ = Edit$(10)            ;A quick visit into AMIGA mode.
  CloseFile 0
  DefaultInput
EndIf
BLITZ

BitMap 0,320,200,5
Slice 0,44,320,200,$fff8,5,8,32,320,320
Use BitMap 0 : Show 0
BlitzKeys On
BitMapOutput 0
BitMapInput

While Joyb(0) = 0 : Print Inkey$ : Wend

As you guys can see, I turn Blitz mode on, then I take a quick
visit into QAMIGA and read a word from a file in Ram ("Hello!")
Then I go back into Blitz mode setting DefaultInput back on. Then
I set up a screen and a slice and prepared the bitmap to read and
write data to it using BitMapOutput and BitMapInput.  Then I go
into a loop reading data from the keyboard.  But I get an error:

"Can't input character from default input"

But how can that be?  I switched to BitmapInput!!!  If I completely
remove the QAMIGA routine, it works just fine!  So, what is going on?
Did I find a BUG????  Please HELP!  It will be impossible to make
any games or programs which require me to read a file in AMIGA mode
and then get input from a bitmap in BLITZ mode!  This is not very
productive!

Thanks to anyone for the HELP!  I NEED it!

I think this is what you are after, does the job nicely (don't know
how big blitz strings can be though, so may crash if a file is too big,
with a bit of work you could split the file into manageable chunks and
use the same command)

If OpenFile(0,"s:startup-sequence")
    FileInput 0
    in$=Inkey$(Lof(0))
    DefaultOutput
    NPrint in$
    CloseFile 0
EndIf

If you want to post a bit of example code, I'll see if I can work out
what is going on.

Erm, not too well up on this myself, but as far as I know a bitmap can
exist without a screen, as you can create a bitmap, draw on it, then attach
it to a screen. In BLITZ mode this can be displayed as is. In amiga mode I
think it has to be attached to a screen.

I havn't used blitz mode (I tend to stick to intuition etc) but as far as I
am aware all the stuff you need is to do with manipulating the slices, but
any further than that is beyond me.

Hi all,

I'll need your help. I'm writing a program what reads binary(!) data 
from the serial port. This data is send by a PC and can be a program 
, IFF pictures, etc. The size of the data is everytime 80 chars.
What I need is a good way to handle this data. How do I write the 
data to a file ??? I tried this simpele program to test:

If OpenFile(0,"hd0:dm2")
  If OpenFile(1,"ram:test")
    MaxLen buf$=80
    l.l=Lof(0)
    whole.l=l/80
    rest.l=l MOD 80
    MaxLen rest$=rest
    For tel.l=1 To whole
      FileInput 0
      buf$=Edit$(80)
      FileOutput 1
      Print buf$;
    Next tel
    FileInput 0
    rest$=Edit$(rest)
    FileOutput 1
    Print rest$;
    CloseFile 1
    CloseFile 0
  EndIf
EndIf
DefaultOutput
NPrint "Done..."
MouseWait:End

But it doesn't work! the final size is smaller! I think it has 
something to do with the 'strange' ascii characters in the file.

I made the program on the PC side in Visual Basic and it has a 
good file handling because you can choose between several file modes 
in one command. If you use the binary mode, you have to define a 
string variabel as a buffer.

But how do I do this in Blitz!

PLEASE HELP, MAYBE SOMEBODY FROM ACID ???????????????????????

Hallo Everybody,


                Does anybody knows why a compiled blitz source crashs when it
was started from Dopus. As soon it meets de command Wbstartup it's going to
hang. Is this still a bug from Blitz ? I'm using currently Blitz2 relase 1.0
Bum5. 

GURU NUMBER:
87000004: Deadend Alert

DESCRIPTION (dos):
AN_AsyncPkt: Unexpected packet
received

RECOVERY SUGGESTION:
If it's supposed to be a workbench
program, some workbench startup-code
is required.


Removing the Wbstartup command is not a solution to me. I wanna to start my prog
from wb. The grazy thing about this is it will start from cli and workbench ?

If OpenFile(0,"hd0:dm2")
  If OpenFile(1,"ram:test")
    l.l=Lof(0)
    For tel.l=1 To l
      FileInput 0
      n$=Inkey$
      FileOutput 1
      Print n$
    Next tel
  EndIf
  CloseFile 1
  CloseFile 0
EndIf
DefaultOutput
NPrint "Done..."

This works!!!!

Hi all.

I am having a problem with loading IFF iamges into screens.
When I load into a screen I get an anoying flash on the current screen.
Any ideas anyone. Also has anyone found a QUICKER IFF loader. Speed is of
the essence with my project and it gets realy bogged down with the current
loader.

Here is a listing of my loader. Any ideas anyone?

   ; load or initialise a screen into S
   USEPATH Events()
   If Len(\_File)>0
      ; Load image
      ILBMInfo \_File
      w.w=ILBMWidth
      h.w=ILBMHeight
      d.w=ILBMDepth
      Id.l=ILBMViewMode
      Free Window S : Free Screen S : Free BitMap S : Free GadgetList S
      BitMap S,w,h,d
      Screen S,0,800,w,h,d,Id,"",1,2,S
      HideScreen S
      ; Now Open Window onto Screen
      Window S,0,0,w,h,$0900,"",1,2
      LoadScreen S,\_File,S
      Use Palette S
      OK.b=True
      MoveScreen S,0,-800
   Else
      OK.b=False
   EndIf

Thanks in advance

Hi Steve,

Hows the mapeditor coming. Did you get my mail about the bug in the 
last version? I can't wait to have a working version. 8)

How long did it take to write the mapeditor out of interest? I'm 
thinking of adding a leveleditor into my game, which will be a sort 
of combined mapeditor and level designer (specifing various map 
variables).

Fancy creating a cut-down version of your program for inclusion in my 
package, may earn you a few pennies 8)

Yes, not including wbstartup and removing the icon will work fine from Dopus.
Including the icon again have as result dopus will try to start the program like
you start from Wb. Result Crash. Including Wbstartup again results to the same
problem, crash. And my prog works fine from cli en wb without any problems ?? 
I'm always testing out PD for our organisation AUGFL (Amiga Users Group

it's a problem (bug) from Dopus.

These 5 lines will give directly a crash from Dopus

OK guys,
	I know this must be easy but how do I stop the screen flashing
when I load in an image onto another hidden screen.
I have tried moving the screen down out of the way but the flash still
happens.

Here is the code.

WBStartup
NoCli


S.b=2


For a=1 To 20
   f$="CDX:Temp/F/1.lres"
   Gosub Action19
   ShowScreen S : VWait 100
   f$="CDX:Temp/F/2.mres"
   Gosub Action19 : VWait 100
   ShowScreen S
Next
End

   S=5-S
   ; load or initialise a screen into S
   If Len(f$)>0 AND Exists(f$)
      ; Load image
      ILBMInfo f$

      Window S,0,0,w,h,$0900,"",1,2,S
      LoadScreen S,f$,S
      Use Palette S
      OK.b=True
   Else
      r=Request("ERROR","Cant open file "+f$,"BYE") : End
      OK.b=False
   EndIf
Return

Any ideas anyone
And any quicker ways to load an IFF image.

The maximum length of a string is defined in the compiler options (resources).
It should be about 10024 (That's what mine is anyway).

Hi all (and Acid too),

I have had various bug reports on my game, and while one or two of 
them are obvious bugs in my code, some of them at first appear to be 
either bugs or deficiencies in blitz itself. I may be wrong on one 
or two of them (so don't flame) me, I'm just trying to chase 
solutions to my problems, buts heres a few of them:

1. My game does not boot from os3.1 (reported by other people, I 
can't test cos I only have 3.0). I think it causes a system crash. 
Also (as reported in other letters), running from DOpus causes a 
similar crash, maybe they are related.

2. I cannot find away to force open a pal screen screen when using 
slices, which is important when running on an ntsc system. Eventually 
I'd like to open a proper ntsc screen and support it properly, but in 
the meantime, I'd like to open a pal screen.

Hmm, I thought there was more than that, maybe my memory is going 8)

Heres a couple of questions tho, maybe you can help me on these:

1. How do I change rgb values in displays (the new display library, 
replacement for slices). Do I use the slice rgb command (doubt it?), 
or is there a command I've missed.

2. When programming in the display library, I understand I create 
some copper lists (using InitCopList) and then call CreateDisplay. 
What happens if I want to dump that display and create another, 
probably based on a different coplist. (e.g. in my game, I go from a 
2slice dp screen, to a full screen slice for the endscreens, etc, 
back to 2slice dp screen etc). 

Also, for this situation, do I have to initialise 3 cop lists (2 for 
the game screens and 1 for the endscreen, even tho this is not used 
until the end), since I understand this will take up a lot of memory.
With slices,, I can delete and create them as the game runs, but I 
can't see similar functions to do this under displaylibs.

Thanks for your time.

P.S. Any release dates available for BUM7? Any chances of fixes for 
the debugger (have you considered the possiblity of remote debugging, 
that would be beautiful!!), the sound/caches problem. Thanks.

No, I don't think the CD32 has 3.1 (I think it has 3.0 with cd 
extensions). Only the a4000T has 3.1, although kick3.1/wb3.1 has just 
been released, which is why I'm getting these reports. Bloody 
annoying I know, in a way, the amiga is getting almost as bad as the 
pc in terms of compatibilty.

Currently, I'm only interested in opening pal or ntsc low res (15khz) 
screens for my game. As I said, I would love a way of specifying PAL 
screens in the slice command, although this would only work on all 
machines if a PAL screen is possible (some old NTSC machines don't 
support this, but I'm not too bothered with that).

Actually, I intend to switch over to using the Display library 
(especially since I hear you used it for SkidMarks), since I remember 
reading that it supports aga and ecs. Will it will possible to 
specify PAL screens in the new display library too, that would be 
excellent!

> At present you have to change them in the palette using agapalrgb and 
> then do a DisplayPalette

Okay, although is it true that you can only use agapalrgb in amiga 
mode. I assume palrgb will also work fine. Any chance of a display
rgb command in future?

Ah excellent! And you can waffle all you like, I'm finding it very 
interesting 8), since the display docs are somewhat brief at the 
moment.

Just one more question, if switching displays, say moving from a 
display based on coplists 0 and 1, to a display based on 2 and 3 (or 
whatever), do I just call CreateDisplay over and over again when 
switching. i.e. is there no need to close down the previous display 
before creating a new one? (I assume not).

Great. 8) Any ideas on the UK release date (we tend to lag behind 
sometimes)

I have no complaints about this whatsoever! 8)

Did you get a chance to look at my game? Opinions?

Ah, you see the latest version of the Mapeditor didn't work at all on 
my machine 8( When I run it, pressed the create map button, then 
loaded in the shapes, I got a new loadshapes dlg. Once the shapes had 
loaded, I clicked on okay, and the program hangs... It doesn't crash, 
but it no longer responds to menu commands or anything. Any ideas?

I hadn't really decided whether I will add a leveleditor yet, but if 
I do, I supposed it will be along the lines of a mapeditor, plus 
other options to vary the levels, like adding restart points, 
defining how man men come out of prisons, that sort of thing. All 
this data is currently held in datat statements, but if I include it 
in the maps then they will be totally self-contained.

I was sort of thinking of releasing this leveleditor separately, to 
existing StarWoids owners, and charging a little extra for it, but 
its all early days at the moment.

I'm not interested in selling or distributing a mapeditor to compete 
with yours in any way whatsoever. In fact, my original idea was this:

1. You give me the code to your mapeditor, lets say the older version 
since advanced features are not too important too me. (this is 
obviously a sticky point, since it requires good faith on both sides, 
especially yours).

2. I convert it to support the features my game needs. At this point 
it doesn't become a standard usable mapeditor anymore, its basically 
only of use when used with my game (since the save files will be 
StarWoids files only). So it doesn't compete with your version at 
all.

3. You obviously get advertising, since you can splash copyright 
messages all other the place 8)

4. And, if I sell it separately, you can have a vey large slice of 
the profits, since the program is essentially yours.

This is all just some initial thoughts on it, I may not do this as 
yet (I'm still weighing up the pros and cons, since it requires a lot 
of coding in the game too, to make things as structured as possible).

What are your thoughts?

Excellent idea, can't wait to check it out.

Hi all!

I'd like to know if the number of shapes is somehow limited or not?
I know that I can set the # from the options window but in my case it 
seems that it doesn't work: I set the # of shapes to 2600 (yes i 
really need them so much and yes I have plenty of mem).
Problem is that when I try to get some shapes (e.g. #2000) then
the blitz says Unable to free memory error. Then I tried to
free shapes by hand:
for t=0 to 2600 : free shapes t : next .Now every time I get
an error Unable to free memory. Funny thing is that when I
check the value of the t then it's every time different, like
first time it's 1024 then 1029 then maybe 1030 etc. So am I 
doing something wrong or what?? BTW. Im using an AGA machine and 
the shapes I try to get are from 8 plane bitmap.
Any help is welcome! Thanks!

Hi there.

Thanks for the tip on using a different order for that little
program I showed everyone, but

BitMapOutput 0
BlitzKeys On
BitMapInput

doesn't seem to work either.  So, therefore you agree with me that
there must be a bug, right?  You think it wouldn't be too naughty of
me to tell Acid to check it out?

*******************************************
*TO: Anyone associated with Acid Software.*
*******************************************

I created a little program to test out BitMapInput, and it seems to
be malfunctioning.  Here is what I did:

1) Went into Blitz mode.
2) Then, right away, go into QAMIGA mode to read in one word from
   a text file in RAM.  Note that I used the FileInput and then the
   DefaultInput commands for it.
3) Back into BLITZ mode.
4) Initialize a Bitmap and a slice.  USE it and SHOW it.
5) I set BitmapOutput to ON and turn BlitzKeys on and set the input
   stream to BitMapInput.
6) Then I do a loop to read typing from the keyboard using Inkey$.

That is when it screws up.  It says "Can't read character from
default input."  Now, I DID set BitMapInput, so it should be reading
from the keyboard, right?  Well, it doesn't seem to.  Is it because
of the way I did it?  Please test this out and check back with me,
OK?  It is IMPERATIVE for the game I am making!!  Thanks.

OH!  Also note that if the file doesn't exist and nothing was read
from it (or if I remove the whole QAMIGA routine entirely) the
typing loop works just fine, so I gather there must be something wrong
with the BitMapInput command, it's not switching properly.

Nelson.

I agree with this, and if you do use blitzkeys, always (AND I MEAN 
ALWAYS!!!!!!! 8^), switch off blitzkeys before jumping into QAMIGA 
mode (and switch them on again when going back into BLITZ mode 
obviously), or you will be in deep shit!

I have serious keyboard buffering problems when using blitzkeys, 
which had me tearing my hair out for ages, until I noticed I wasn't 
disabling/enabling blitzkeys when using QAMIGA mode. Sigh... 8)

Standart BlitzII is using a double precission var known as floats. That means,
if you put none extention after the var, double precission var are used (.f).
Double precission var have one big disadvantage. There are not quite exact in
calculating numbers. But you can go from a range of +/-9*10^18, you have to deal
with this big disadvantage. So, a solution to you prblem will be very simple.
Try to use (.q) singe precission var known as quick. If you have enough with var
going from a range +/-32768.0000. Plus they have a advantage to. they are only
using 2 bytes of mem, so you win 2 bytes !

Try this

number.q=5.7896
Print number.q
MouseWait


        _
    /X\
   // \\ -
  (BLITZ) If you like the real world !
   \\ // --
    \X/ _

... Yes ! This is Belguim calling. ;-)

Thanx for Acid for clearing this thing out! So 1000 shapes is limit.
Just wondering why ted lets me set the # of shapes > than 1000.

Well...anyway, I suppose some of U out there wonder why the hell
I need so many shapes?
So here's some information about my project to clear thing out:

It's the clone of the game called Turbo Rocket (original was in 
fact called Turbo Raketti) by Finnish dude Heikki Kosola.
In my oppinion it's the best shareware 2 player game I've ever seen.
In short it's 2 player gravity (thrust) game. As the gfx
wasn't very impressive and I just had some cool ideas 
of my own I decided to create my own verion of it.
It'll be AGA only game (maybe cut-down versions later).
Almost all GFX will be rendered (Real 3D). For one player
there are 256 shapes (it really looks 3D-ish and cool). So
thats why so many shapes - as I need for players 512 then there
will be some bonus and other stuff (well ok...I hope I'll manage
with 1000 shapes too ;). Then there are some kewl tunes and
sound effects too. The game is not just pure soot'em'up -
there will be some racing sections too. In fact I've design it
as a racing game with this little feature to trash your opponent :).

Anyway it's kinda hard to explain all features- U just have to see 
it. I'm not working on it alone - there is one GFX artist,
one dude is rendering specialist and coder and then there's me -
muzak+fx an coding.

Well I hope U wish me luck coz I've working on this project for 
about half a year now (first in am*s - yes I dropped this one
coz it was too slow) and now in blitz.

So if I manage to make some working version of it I'll upload
it to aminet. 

Be well dudes! CU!

Hi all,

	I am currently trying to write a uuencoded file splitter,
but have a few questions that I need answers to.

	Is is possible to quickly determine how many lines of text there are in
a file of ASCII text (with varying line lengths).

	Can you get blitz to read in lines of text (again of varying length),
but all ending with a newline character, and if so how?

	At present, I only know how to read in text of fixed length, using:


If Readfile (f$,0)
	While not EOF(0)
		a$=Inkey$(xx)
	Wend
CloseFile 0
End If

	where xx is the length of the line.

	Any help would be much appreciated!

Aaaaaahhhhh!  THAT must be the problem!  I thought about this a couple

I will do that and see if it works! (After all, it worked for you!)

	Hey, I just bought Blitz 2 today at my local shop.  Looks good.

	A few questions:

	I've been trying to compile the examples in the archive directory,
but it won't find the includes in the directory.  How do I set the proper
include directory?

	Can I get more source code?  I need some heavily documented source
with basic stuff like using bobs, sprites, backgrounds, etc.  Also, can
I get a hold of all the programs mentioned in the 5 included issues of Blitz
User?

	Where's the CD32 developers kit?  I'm very interested in this.

Something strange is happenning to the MED commands in my
programs.  I load a MED module, I initialize it and then in a loop
I use PlayMED and a VWait.  Ok, this works, but it's way to slow!
Then I tried putting 3 playmeds in a row in that loop and it got
close to the proper speed but still it was too slow.  4 Playmeds
in a row made it play too FAST! I also tried the same routine set
on an interrupt but it did the same thing.  Is it perhaps because
I have an Amiga 4000 with a 68040 in it or something?

Yes, that MED reply wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, but I will try
playing around with the timing in MED to see if I can get it to
work properly.  In the mean time, can you tell me why I keep getting
a syntax error when I try to open the serial port?  Please give me an
example of how to use the OpenSerial command found in BUM #2.
Thanks.

	Hey, I've been fooling around with the ball blitting program included
in the Blitz2 examples--adding joystick routines etc.--but I have a problem
playing mods.  
	I loaded up a mod, but when I go into Blitz mode and use the playmodule
command, it says it cannot free enough memory.  Why?  I've got 4 megs of RAM,
2 of which are Chip RAM (I'm running on a 4000/030).  What's the problem?
I can't find any command in the reference guide which deals with memory
in regards to sound/mods.
	Also, when I try and make my own shapes, I get an error when loading
them in.  Says it can't find the CMAP IFF or something.  I assume it's an
error with the shape file, in the way it was saved or something.  But, I used
the shapegrabber included with Blitz2, so what's the problem?

	Also, the runtime error box on my 4000 is messed up.  It seems to
display it in NTSC super-hires mode, and it looks like two error boxes 
superimposed on eachother.  Each letter is doubled, and it's hard to read.
If I click on the box and then smash keys at random, occasionally it will
change to lores mode and become readable.  What gives?

I am aware of the HELP key function, BUT it says NOTHING about those
brackets you have there!  How the hell am I supposed to know if I
should use brackets or not?  Anyways, I tried it out.  Aside from your
inversed "serial.device" and device # 0, it works.

Sheeesh!  Dumb brackets.

Have you figured out why the MED commands don't work properly on my
computer?  I tryed playing around with the speeds in MED, but I cannot
get it to work!  I still need several PlayMed commands in the loop,
and I still don't get the right speed I want.  Also, ProTracker
MODs don't work either.  They play too fast, plus sometimes the
instruments that are playing get choked and they don't come out
sometimes.  I can fix that problem in ProTracker by changing the DMA
value (whatever the heck that is) and it works in ProTracker, but it
still plays too fast.  How else can I play a MOD with my programs?

Has anyone had any luck playing modules using Blitz Basic ][?
MED or MOD!?  With my A4000 I've just been having bad luck left and

Sorry for not replying to you directly, but I seem to be having
difficulty with my mailing system here.  So here goes.

I think the best thing you can do is publish your BUM mags on disk
because it's cheaper for everyone, easier for everyone and much
easier to handle.  Releasing a new version of Blitz is not really
very necessary until you have some MAJOR changes in it!  And I'm not
talking about a new editor!  I'm talking about better programmed
routines etc... but even those can be replaced by rewriting the
libs!  So, I think the best think you can do, is just release updates
and tutorials on diskette, you already have the finished product, so
continue adding onto it.

Besides, I'd rather pay a couple of bucks for BUM on a disk rather
than 20 bucks for 4 mags.  Whaddaya say about that?
If you do that, I will be the first one to order it!   :)

Nelson!

I know you use the & symbol to find a variable's address, but how
can you then find its length? The programmers guide says
"adress-4" (typo and all). Sometimes I think that Greek would
be easier to learn.

An example...

Dim map.b(20,20,8)

<<fill up variable as needed>>

adrs=&map(1,1,0)

How do I find the end of this variable?

Thanx

Hmm....I don't know if MED has a DMA function, I'll check though.  As
for your MED player, if it is only called once every 50th (which is
normal) how come it plays the module so slowly?  Like I said before,
I'd need 3 PlayMeds in a row and then the VWait to get close to the
normal speed (but still NOT normal speed!)

How do other module players play modules?  They undoubtedly have an
interrupt every 50th Vblank and they sound ok.  Hmm.

You said that other users had created their own module players?
Then can you tell me what is involved in creating my own?  I have the
source code (in ML) for a ProTracker player.  Can I somehow
incorporate this player in Blitz ][ and play my mods through it
all the while continuing through the rest of the program?

Much appreciation.
Nelson.

Ok, this works MUCH better now!  But the speed is still a little off
It's just going a tad too fast.  I made the mod in PAL using Pro-
Tracker, and it's speed was 132 BPM.  I did what you said by loading
the mod using OctaMed (V 5.0 as well) and changing it from BPM to SPD
(I would have never thought of using SPD instead of BPM).  And now
when I play it from Blitz ][, it still goes just a little too fast, but
this is probably due to the frequency.  I'll play around with it a
little.  Thanks!

Hi again.

Ok, I've been playing around with Blitz and my mod for a few minutes,
but I still couldn't make it play at the proper speed.  It is EXTREMELY
close, but still too slow (or fast, depending on the SPD settings I
save in OctaMED).  I also tried openning up a PAL screen (and an NTSC
screen just in case, but something fishy is going on.  I tried opening
up a PAL screen but it doesn't open up in PAL.  It has the dimensions,
and it shows about 230 lines, but I can tell it's not a PAL screen.
How do you open up your screens in PAL?  I changed my screenmode to PAL
Hires, and I also used the Degrader for good measure.  And the NTSC
function tells me that the system is currently in PAL.  But when I open
a screen, it's not a PAL screen. I'll keep playing around with it,
but some more help would be appreciated...mercy.

Nelson.

I agree, that one sis account is getting irrating. Can you sort it

 AAAAARRRGGGGHH!!!

 My first Blitz game (Pingwynne) is 98% finished and I've just found 
 a *NASTY* blitz bug!  Sometimes shapes blitted to the screen using BLIT
 just don't appear... Now the monsters in my game vanish for short periods
 of time, making it a tad difficult to avoid them!

  The monsters are loaded in as shapes, then each time one moves it does the
  following:

    VWAIT 1
    BLIT 0,oldx,oldy   ; Delete by blitting a shape which is a rectangle of the
                         same colour as the background
    BLIT 1,x,y         ; Blit monster in new position 

  I know this probably isn't the best way to do it, but is SHOULD work!
  (I'm using an A1200 with accelerator, but it also happens on a standard
   1200)
  Its as if the first BLIT (to delete it) is working, but the second one just
  doesn't happen. 

  Anyone have any suggestions how to cure this?  Is this a bug that's known
  about and will be fixed in a future BUM? 


  PLEASE help if you can!!  Otherwise I'll give up on computers and
   technology forever, and move to the Outer Hebrides to live a simple
  life as a hermit...


  -Matt.

let me do pre-release reviews for the blitz coders, shall make em sell

That's the one I think would suite Blitz users best...

Nah, would still be the same kinda distribution hassles and means
unneccesary ongoing costs for us users requiring the updates.
Making the BUM's into a very large Bottom in the form of an
amigaguide file is the way to go...

Can you make more from less work going onto the other projects?
If so then I guess it'd be best for you but o'course Blitz will suffer.

I have had some luck playing med modules with BB2. This was some time ago though
and this is straight from memory: There are two speedsettings in Med. When You
are composing, one of the settings will be ignored by bb2. Solution: just use the 
other setting... . I dont know which one of the settings you should use but if I 
remember right there is a three digit number followed by a two digit number,
like xxx/xx. I think that it's the two digit setting that means anything to BB2.

Hi there.  ok, I tried your example:
loadmedmodule 0,"Ram:Mod"
 setint 5
     playmed
 end setint
 startmedmodule 0
 mousewait
 StopMed

It practically the same thing I've been doing, and as I said, the mod
is EXTREMELY close to the right speed...just a tad faster would be
perfect.  The way it plays now is just a little too slow, cause there
is space in   between each sample being played, the samples aren't
connecting at the right time to make a smooth sounding mod.
Any other ideas that might help?  I've been testing out some
machine language calling, using the CALL command and the PLOAD command
but everytime I try calling something, it gives me a recoverable guru.
(I'm testing this cause I want to try to call an external mod player
source code to play the mod.)

Anyways, thanks for any other help you can give me.

Nelson.

Oh yeah, you also asked me what kinda Amiga I have.

I have an Amiga 4000/040.  6 megs ram (2 C, 4 F).  You think that
might be the prob?  I know that when I use ProTracker to play mods
it sometimes skips a sample or two here and there, and the songs sound
unfinished (this is because the DMA is set too low, or some other
technobabble like that.)

Hello all,


          could somebody help me with next problem. I'm trying to work with the
gadtools gadgets and dit'nt find a way to change te size of the arrows from the
GTScroller. I'm having always the same result, a vertical scroller of 100 pixels
will be diveded by 2. Half part for the scroller en half part for the arrows. 
So, you will get arrows of 25 pixels high. I dont know, but that is not what i
am surching for. Let's say a arrow of then pixels will be fine. So, my question
How can change this size ?

To the blitz creators:

I understand, it's not always possible to bring fast a new update or version out
like the one we all are waiting for, "Bum7". Still, is there no posibiliti to
get a recent version like "Bum6" i'm still using "bum5" now, you know. I will
pay for it if nesecery. Where could i find it ? The same about the comments on
the box when i byed blitz. Very usefull progs like intuition planner you printed
on it. Where could i find them ? Is there any bbs/net on the world that still
have them ?

	Okay, I know this code listing is a bit long.  Please forgive me.
But, I'm having what seems to be a program flow problem.  I'm new to Blitz,
so I'm not sure how to handle it... I keep getting If without Endif, illegaly
nested command, etc. errors, and I don't know why.  I think it's got something
to do with the misuse of the pop command.  So, if someone would be so kind,
please look this over, I'm sure it's just a simple mistake.

	Umm, actually...how do you output Blitz code as ASCII text, this
source file doesn't seem to transfer as text.  Well, if someone is willing
to help me out, I could mail the source personally, that would save bandwidth.

I use Blitz2 on a 15".28 1280x1024 NI SVGA monitor,  
monitor driver I use is DBLNTSC LACED NO FLICKER with mode promotion,
When I get a debugger window (the black box on the lower half of the 
screen) it is all screwed up: whole bunch of black boxes and lines 
totally unreadable. I tried to use different display modes, etc... 
but to no avail. It's a real pain to have to switch to standard NTSC 
mode/NO mode promotion, and having to use TWO monitors to do work. 
Am I missing something here?
if somebody responds to it please send also to my personal account:
gorny@saturn.rowan.edu for I don't have an immediate access to blitz-
list. Thank you, thank you, thank you if you help me out?

I don't know if anyone has seen it, but my game Commando Raid was
finally put up on Aminet, it is in the game/shoot directory (I think as
CommandoRaid.lha).  Check it out...

The other thing I was wondering is, is anyone at all interested in
writing a game with me?  I want to write either a horizontal or vertical
scrolling shooter but I need someone with GOOD ability to design the
graphics ... email me if you're interested.

No, I wasn't using double buffering - maybe I'll give it a try.  But if I don't
want to double buffer, how would I get around this problem?  Just make sure
the second blit is done as soon after the first as possible?

Hello,
	Sorry to say I am back again, some poor sob has given me a job!

	Just a question for the Acid bods...
	
	OK so all registered users are going to get an update to Blitz2, OK
so all BUM subscribers are going to get a little more, but when? Don't get
me wrong, I think Acid are doing a great job, I mean there is not a whole
truck load of you is there? Is the problem lack of contributions? Are we
the users being lazy? The other worry I have is that as Acid have move 
their UK HQ, will my BUM subscription be lost AGAIN? Did the move go 
smoothly or do I have call and check?

	Good news about the debugger though! Any other additions? Date? 

	And a question for those who know more than me (No Martin that is not
EVERYONE).

	In BPLCON4 I can set some bits to say which colours sprites should
use. As default for AGA modes they use $11, which is 240-255, how exactly
does this work. And with all the hype, what are the features of AGA sprites,
AND am I going to have any problems having 8 sprites on a 64 colour AGA
display?

	Thanks for your help, and Acid you really are doing a good job.

	So please get BUM7 out ;)

 Greetings Blitz-folk,

    I'm having trouble transfering a Blitz game I've written to floppy-disk.
 I wrote in on an A1200 with hard drive, made an executable and put this
 and all the shape files it loads onto a floppy.

 When I then try running it from floppy, it loads the executable, then
 it loads something from the harddrive (I don't know what), then continues
 to load in the shapes from the floppy - and it runs ok.

 I then tried it on my friends A1200 without a hard drive, and after loading
 the executable it asks you to put in the workbench disk (or whatever you
 booted with) and it loads something, then crashes.

 (If I boot my friends machine with the Blitz Basic disk, it loads something
  from this, and then runs OK).

 The question is, what is it trying to load from the workbench disk?  And
 why?  Surely once you've made an executable it should run as a stand-alone
 program? 

   Any clever people know whats going on?

Hi all!

I need to examine a dir for certain files. Is there
any commands in blitz like Examine and ExNext in C.
I heard that DosElmore lib contained commands like this
but where can I get this? Or is there any other solution
for this problem ? Help!!!

Matt,
 Please forgive me is this sounds a bit obvious but...

 You are double buffering the screen arn't you?

 If you are not then the disappearing blits could be nothing more than
a timing problem, i.e. the blits are being done AFTER the beam has passed that
area of the screen.

 If you are buffering the screen then I dont have a clue to what the problem
is.

Hope that helps

Ian.

I know this may be old for some of you but it's a problem I just
encountered. I got the latest version of XPRZmodem and I tried to make a
blitz library out of it using FDconv.  So far so good ... then I ran
makedeflibs (because libmanager wouldn't run, kept crashing), and then I
tried using one of the commands in a blitz program.  I typed out
XProtocolSend_ and it converted it to some AddGadget_ command!  Does
anyone know what went wrong?

I've been attempting to create strings outside of blitz and have come to the
conclusion that I souldn't as Blitz crashes when it trys to free the string.

With this in mind I have now proceeded to create a library to scan a block
of memory extracting strings terminated with a new line (faster edit function).

This is my current interpretation of the way command in a library work.

Register A3 points to a tempory string. I can only assume that this is
the string buffer. 

When a function, that returns a string, finishes it returns the string
size in d0. The part that I'm not sure about is what does A3 return.
I've seen other library code and for the library a3 returns a pointer
to the last character in the string. 

Is this correct?

Also could someone elaborate a bit more apon the tutorial for creating a library.

Thanks Mark.

I wrote a program which goes from "Blitz" mode to "Amiga" mode and then back
to "Blitz" mode.  When I ran the program, I got a guru.  Now whenever I 
boot-up my Amiga I get the following message:

	DH0
	has a checksum error
	on disk block 21543

So what's wrong with my Amiga now?  Is this a serious problem? And how do I
fix it?

Thanks in advance (A LOT)

You might get checksum errors when switching from Amiga -> Blitz mode in the
following fashion:

(1) In Amiga mode, you begin reading or (more likely) writing a file, and
while the computer is still flushing buffers you
(2) Switch to Blitz mode, thus killing the OS, including disk activity, thus
creating a damaged block(s) on the device still being used.

To the avoid this problem in the future, you should wait before entering Blitz
mode until all disk activity stops.  Since there is no way of knowing this via
the OS, most programmers simply pause before they shutdown the OS for 3-5
seconds.  This provides sufficient delay for disks to stop spinning.  I
suspect that reading the Blitz manuals would have told you the same thing.

To (attempt to) repair the damage you have caused your hard disk, you need a
disk repair program such as the popular DiskSalv.  If you know a lot about
disk structure and the contents of any file(s) that were destroyed, you could
also attempt to do this yourself with a disk editor.  If you have an earlier
version of the OS, you might have diskdoctor in your C directory.  Delete it.
You're better off getting one of the many freeware/shareware programs out
there such as FixDisk or the already mentioned DiskSalv.

Hope this helps,
Christopher Jennings

Hi, all

I am having a problem with lists. (Sound familiar)

Here is a demo piece of code.
Pick the problem when running this little demo.

y and z are not cleared.
If you re-use the list you will get old values appearing.
Bit of a worry this.



NEWTYPE.fred
   x.b:y:z
End NEWTYPE


Dim List tom.fred(10)

USEPATH tom()
While AddFirst(tom())
   \x=Rnd(5) : \y=Rnd(30) : \z=Rnd(90)
Wend

ResetList tom()

Format "###"
While NextItem(tom())
   NPrint \x," ",\y," ",\z
Wend

ClearList tom()

NPrint ""

While AddFirst(tom())
   \x=35
Wend

ResetList tom()

Format "###"
While NextItem(tom())
   NPrint \x," ",\y," ",\z
Wend

MouseWait

End

ANY IDEAS????

Subject: Checksum errors.



        I trashed one of my partitions a while ago and also received a
checksum error.  I used Disksalv and it totally screwed my harddisk up.

        After that,  I did use an old(1990) version of FIXDISK and that
solved all the checksum problems and recovered all my files with hardly any
user interaction.

 Fellow Blitzers,

        Anyone know how to write an array to a file, using PUT?
 I've tried the following:

 
       Dim s(37,43)
       ; Fill 's' with the data etc.

       ok=OpenFile(0,"DH0:blitz2/data.dat")
       Fields 0,s
       Put 0,0

       CloseFile 0

 When I check the length of the file created, it is only 4 bytes.
 Can anyone see what the problem is?


 -Matt.

Hi guys,

I just started using your many blitz libs over the weekend, and I 
must say they are fantastic 8) Keep it up lads. I have a couple of 
questions and problems tho.

1. The UnpackIFF and Cludge functions are great for adding caching 
support to my game. Have you considered adding functions for music 
modules and sprites? Also, have you considering adding compression 
and/or encription to the decompressing routines, which would allow 
data to be both small and safe on disk, and take up less memory when 
cached in fast mem?

2. I converted my anim display functions to use your libs rather than 
the blitz one (I'm interested in the fastmem support), but the 
results were all jerky on playback. In my game, in the data1 
subdirectory, I think the file (if my memory serves me correct) is 
gfx18 which is an 27 frame op5 anim. Could you have a go at playing 
this back?

Thats about it. I have some more ideas, I'll post them soon.

Hi all,

Up until now, I've been using the deflibs file that came with bum6 
with no probs whatsoever. However, last weekend I decided to add some 
more libs to my blitzlist userlib directory. After recompiling the 
deflibs, I hit on a problem.

When running any blitz program (either old slice based or display lib 
based), on my system which runs in hires, the blitz programs fail to 
open a pal lowres screen properly (they mode promote when they 
shouldn't). However, if I copy the bum6 deflibs back, all programs 
work fine.

I checked that all the blitzlibs files are present and correct, and 
nothing seems to be missing. Any ideas why this is happening? I even 
took out the userlibs files I added, recompiled the deflibs 
(resulting in a file approximately the same size as the bum6 
version), and it still didn't work.

Its not serious, I just run WB in lowres when working on my game, 
but I'm interested in why its happening. 

Bye for now lads 8)


P.S. for all those still using slices, move over to the new 
displaylibs, they are great 8)

 Hi people,

        Q. Is there any way of converting a shape to a different number
           of bitplanes?

           I've got lots of 8 colour (3 bitplane) shapes, and I want to
           Blit them onto a 1 bitplane bitmap, so where the original shape
           was colour 0 it stays 0, and everything else becomes colour 1.

  Any ideas?


  Thanx, Matthew.

Hi all!

I know this problem is already discussed here but..just 
to make sure:

Is there any way to load shapes without using the LoadShapes
command (I just need it, don't ask me why :)
What I want to do is just alloc some chip mem and then
load shape data as binary into it. Now is there some way to tell
blitz that I have my shapes starting at mem I allocated (like
CludegeMedModule works). Any help is welcome! Tahnx!

Hello,

I`ve been trying to get a dual playfield slice together with more than

4 bitplanes in the background bitmap. This didn`t seem to be possible until

I tried using the new AGA screen commands which seem to do exactly what I 

want however my sprites no longer appear. Are them some new AGA sprite 

commands I don`t know about and also are there a set of AGA screen fade 

commands??? Could I have more than 8 lo-res sprites with AGA?

Thanks in advance,

CludgeShape(s) would be cool! BTW I think it would be cool
if one could "Cludge" every blitz object (like samples,shapes,bitmaps 
etc.) - for example if I want to use 10 samples then I have to
load them all one by one. More cooler way I think is to make 
one linked sample, then alloc some chip and then CludgeSample 
sam#,Addr. Bye for now!

        Possibly - not quite sure.  But it's also in my libs: directory.


  ALSO - a couple of asm questions....
  ~~~~

     1. Does anyone know about using the trace bit(s) /vector, for trapping
        each command the 680x0 runs.

        I think the 68000 uses bit 15 but the other processors use bits 14
        and 15.

     2. How do you gain access to the SR and PC when the trace interrupt
        has been called?

     3. Will this sort of program run under blitz basic?

  I've tried running SnoopDOS and the file it is trying to load in is
  'LIBS:diskfont.library'.  So I made a LIBS drawer on my floppy disk,
  and copied this file into it.  BUT when I run my executable prog., it
  still asks for the boot disk to be replaced, even though the file
  it is looking for is available already on my game disk!!  Why doesn't it
  look there first?  Is there any way of making sure that is does?


  Thanx, Matthew.

There is already a nice CludgeShape command, its in the Reflective 
Images (I hope I got that name right) RILibs extensions. It works 
nicely too.

You are painting off the visible screen are you? Well you'd have to, 
to get smooth pixel scrolling. If not, just allocate a bitmap bigger 
than the visible screen by 2 16pixel blocks in all directions, and 
blit into the furthest 16pixel area.

If scrolling at 16pixels per frame is what you want, you don't have 
much choice really. However, if 16 pixels every 2 or 4 frames is okay 
(and thats still pretty fast), why not break down the bits into 
groups. So, if going at 16 pixels every 4 frames, break down the 
blits into equal sizes of 4 groups of blits. Save heaps of time.

Theres are more clever ways in which to do 8way scrolling, which I'm 
trying to perfect now.

Hi all,

I have been improving the hardware scrolling in my game over the last 
few days. I found a few tricks to give me about 50% speed increase 
over what I had before, and I also discovered a lovely way to get the 
vertical scrolling part, by using the copper.

Which leads me to my first problem. How do I go about programming the 
copper in my game, which makes use of the new DisplayLibs??? I know 
that there are a few copper instructions in the slices area of the 
manual, and I tried inserted a simple colour split to test to see if 
it would work, but the debugger flagged it as an error, so I assume 
it won't. I need to setup a copper list badly for my scrolling idea. 
Nothing too complicated, just changing a few points at a few points 
on the screen. But how??

Nest question for Acid Software:

Finally, is there an equivalent command to ShowBlitz for the new 
display library? (Note that ShowBlitz seems to crash when run in 
displaylib based programs). My game jumps into AMIGA mode to pop up 
some requestors, and I need to restore the display properly when 
coming back into BLITZ, otherwise, the screen is screwed......

Thanks.

Yes, its a newer version. On behalf of Steve, I'll fetch in the 
latest libs and make them available on my ftp site. I'll announce 
this tomorrow.

        That reminds me, I found the same thing with ASLFileRequest$.  Put
it in a statement and it runs then gurus, put it in the main prog and no
problem!

        Also, where can I get these RILibs from?  Every one seems to be
talking about them and all these new commands.

        Matt.

Hello guys,
	   Just a quick question. I am using Display lib (excellent stuff)
for a game I am writing, and all of a sudden a problem appeared. When I 
quick the program I get a blank screen, if you click on the unseen 
screen-to-back gadget up pops the blitz screen or wb screen if run
as an executable. This suddenly seemed to start doing this so it MUST
be something I am doing as it didn't do it to start with.

	The other note for Acid is... Is there any chance of including
some '020 and '030  instructions/addressing modes into Blitz on the
assembler side, the game I am writing would benefit muchly from them.

	Many thanks,

	Nigel Hughes

Hi all, 

On behalf of Reflective Images (the two Steves 8^), I've put the
latest version of their RILibs extensions for blitz on my ftp server. 
This is only available on weekdays (UK) from around 9am to 6pm, but 
it will do until it reachs aminet I imagine.

I have also put the blitz amigaguide document (I forget the author 
now) which ware released recently, the one which listed all the third 
party blitzlibs.

If you want to out your own blitz programs or lib extensions on this 
site, then feel free to. This site is currently unformatted (just one 
directory), but if demand is high enough, I could structure it a 
little better and call it the blitz site 8)

Hi all, 

On behalf of Reflective Images (the two Steves 8^), I've put the
latest version of their RILibs extensions for blitz on my ftp server. 
This is only available on weekdays (UK) from around 9am to 6pm, but 
it will do until it reachs aminet I imagine.

I have also put the blitz amigaguide document (I forget the author 
now) which ware released recently, the one which listed all the third 
party blitzlibs.

If you want to out your own blitz programs or lib extensions on this 
site, then feel free to. This site is currently unformatted (just one 
directory), but if demand is high enough, I could structure it a 
little better and call it the blitz site 8)

  You can get them by ftp from wuarchive.wustl.edu (128.252.135.4) in 
  /dev/basic.  I think they are version 1.1

	Hey, a few questions...

	I lost my original Blitz BASIC 2 registration form.  Who do I mail
to register?  Can I do it without the original form?

	Also, can someone send me some shape collision code?  I'm trying
to code a collision detection routine for my invaders game, but the collision
section of the reference guide is painfully terse.  I need some SIMPLE
examples.

	Oh, and why do Caffiene Free and Insectoids refuse to run on my 4000?


	BTW, is it possible to unsubscribe my nugget@genesis.tiac.net
account and sign up my school one here insteads?  I can't seem to send messages
to the list from my other account.  (This one is rbarbaga@cs.uml.edu)

Hello there,
	    Thanks to the chap who gave me the aminet file, should help.

	Does anyone know how the CD32 chunky screen thing works, does
it take an area of memory you have treated as chunky, and copy it to
an area of memory, but in planar form? Or do you just say, hey this 
screen is chunky, sort it out yourself maty, and convert it on the fly?

	Acid might be best placed to answer this. 

	Have you all heard? The UK management by-out has got the big C!
They plan to be back to normal by Novemeber, well here's hoping!

	Nigel Hughes

Hi all!

I can't display 64 pic (6 plane ) AGA pic. I'm usin this so called
new display lib commands like initcoplist and createdisplay.

Code looks like this:

Bitmap 0,576,464,6
InitCopList 0,31,128,$10008+$10,8,64,0
CreateDisplay 0
DisplayBitmap 0,0,0,0

What I need to do is display  6 plane pic but it only displays
correclty if I make 8 plane bitmap.
So if I set plane # from 1 to 7 then there's my pic + some crap.
Problem is that I need this bitmap to be VERY big and in fact
I need 2 of them . So it's complete waste of da good old chip mem
if I must have 8 plane bitmap insted of 6. So does anybody
know what I'm doing wrong? Do I have to set some extra bits in 
type when initing cop list? Help!!!

HI!

Just wondering if I'm doing something worng or are things meant to be 
like this:

I have little statement for plotting...erm plots. So i checked
out next thing: 
Instead of calling the statement i copied the whole routine
to main loop - now it turned out that the thing is SLOWER!!!
So what is this?? Are asm only statements faster than asm + basic 
code?? In fact it seems like mixed asm and basic code is not usable 
at all (at least in main loop when U have to do thing s 50 x in sec).
Comments???

F.T.A.O anybody using BLoad on a network (esp. the guy who told me of the
problem - sorry mate, lost the original message)

The bug has been fixed. It twas me being stupid as usual - I was thinking
that the Lock() type would be the same as Open() so I was using 1005 or
whatever when I should have been using -1. Oops. Silly me.

Anybody who would like a copy of the update can either mail me direct,
or in about 7 days time can FTP the library set from Martin Kifts FTP
site at CEKIFT.SWAN.AC.UK

Yep, it does that on mine too. I generally run WB in multisync mode, 
which Ted likes and runs beautifully in.

Here's a coupla statements which may prove useful to all you brilliant
Blitz coders out there.
Basically it performs the ColSplit command but on AGA displays.
Don't ask me why you need a display x2 as high, perhaps its AGA being
crummy. Perhaps its me being crummy. Anyway, enough of this crap.
Here it is.....


NEWTYPE .rgbcomp				; Cos blitz cant
  r.w						; pass >6 params
  g.w
  b.w
END NEWTYPE

DEFTYPE .rgbcomp agacolour1,agacolour2		; Start and End cols


; Pass the coplist number
; Plus y-start, y-end and a colour number
Statement AGAColSplit {clist.l,y1.w,y2.w,colnum.w}
  SHARED agacolour1,agacolour2
  r1.w=agacolour1\r
  g1.w=agacolour1\g
  b1.w=agacolour1\b
  r2.w=agacolour2\r
  g2.w=agacolour2\g
  b2.w=agacolour2\b
  rs.q=((r2-r1)/(y2-y1))
  gs.q=((g2-g1)/(y2-y1))
  bs.q=((b2-b1)/(y2-y1))		; Calculate step values
  rc.q=r1
  gc.q=g1
  bc.q=b1
  PaletteInfo 0				; Needed to get AGAPalRed etc
  ro.w=AGAPalRed(colnum)
  go.w=AGAPalGreen(colnum)
  bo.w=AGAPalBlue(colnum)		; Store the old values
  For h.w=y1 To y2			
     AGAPalRGB 0,colnum,Int(rc),Int(gc),Int(bc)
     CustomColors clist,8*(h-y1),h,0,colnum,1	; Dont ask me how...
     rc+rs		; Each instruction is 8 bytes (we hope)
     gc+gs
     bc+bs
  Next h
  AGAPalRGB 0,0,ro,go,bo			; Restore the originals
End Statement

Function.l CCSize {height.l}			; Used to calc
  Function Return height*8			; Size of CustomCop instructions
End Function

.e.g

	InitCopList  0,44,256*2,$10008,8,256,CCSize{256}
;The last parameter allocates memory for Custom copperlist instructions
;which (with no thanks to ACID) is used by CustomColors.

; for some unkown reason, we need to create the display twice as high
; but makes no difference to the display though
	agacolour1\r=0
	agacolour1\g=0
	agacolour1\b=0
	agacolour2\r=255
	agacolour2\g=255
	agacolour2\b=255
	AGAColSplit{0,0,255,0}		; Use coplist 0, from 0 to 255
					; using colour 0
	CreateDisplay 0

And there you go! Try it out and let us know if it works or not.

hi there,

        just seen swapping routine in a PC Visual Basic manual at work and
wondered if anyone else knew of the routine.....

NORMAL SWAP                             Cool Swap
-----------                             ---------

        temp = a                        a = a xor b
        b = a                           b = b xor a
        a = temp                        a = a xor b


This new routine actually gets rid of the 3rd variable and 'could' reduce
the processing time?? I problem is is that it can only work on numbers NOT
strings - or could it? - who knows, who cares!

	Hi,
		This may be OLD news but the  RI-mapeditor 
	has some serious problems running on my 1200 - Pal (6megs 881).


		- On starting the create/load map window is all stuffed up
		  The fonts are out of wack and so the buttons are 
		  wrong. Selecting "create" causes a hang :)

		- So "load" and cancel a few times take me to the menus
		  eventually (because I have no maps :) )

		- Selecting new map from menu is a bad call . see first point

		- However the load shape/palette works fine
		  As well as "About"

		- But the configure menu stuffs out and hangs on a save

	This must of happened to others?


	anyway
		-design issues 
			personally I think it would be better if you
		could see all or at least a page full of shapes when
		your selecting  a tile.
				ie spacebar flicks you to it as now
				   but makes for much quicker selection


		- from a gui design point of view its ok - 
			- forces you to use the opening window though :(
				^
				| "ignore" =>COMP330 is effecting me - ARRGG!!

	By the way I'm not having a go at you, This is just my opinion
		and my opinion dont count much over 14000km hey :-)

	anyway at least someone is trying to help blitz game coders 
	so keep up the good work.

Evertime I make a demo, I have to load up a graphics file and/or
a music file.  Is it possible to INCLUDE them in a Blitz program
so I don't have to have more than 1 file for my demos?  Incbin
does something like that, but if I wanted to include a medmodule
how would I play it afterwards?  Certainly not with PlayMed since it
doesn't receive an address as a parameter.  So, what can be done?

Thanks for any help.

 Well...as far as I know it's impossible to tell Blitz compiler
 WHERE  (chip or fast ) you want to put the included data when 
 your proggy starts. So as Med module must be in chip mem
 U can't incbin it - as U never know where (chip or fast) it'll be.
 This INCBIN thing only works if it's not important where you want your
 data (asm routines, map data etc.)
 BTW ther is command CludgeMedModule - if U alloc Chip, bload med 
 module into it and then CLUDGE it then it's just like loadmedmodule.
 Hope that helped.

I thought I'd mail the list with info about my map editor that should be
rereleased soon.  It has tons of new features and is a lot more stable than the
original version (yes I know - the original was less stable than a glider in a
thunder storm).

There is one slight problem with the program, though.  I think that it has now
become WorkBench 3.0 + only.  This is because it is completely reliant of
GTlists but does not renumber them too only use numbers 50+.  Also it uses the
command GTGetAttrs which the Blitz people say is a workbench 3.0 + only
command.  Sorry if this upsets people, I have only got workbench 3.0 so I have
no way of knowing whether any changes I make to the program will make it work
on an older machine.

Keen new features include:

			o Full screen shape select (for Jurgen, Martin, Steve etc...)
			o Surface data editing
			o Reflect table
			o Undo function!
			o Right mouse button shape select
			o Groups can now have upto 100 blocks in them
			o Works properly in Super Hirez now
			o And loads more that I can't remember

Hopefully, the editor should be available soon.  Mail me with agro if you want
it to be very soon!

I managed to display 64 colour (6 plane) pic but the palette was 
wrong???
Someone in list told that his game uses 64 colour (AGA - not 
EHB) slice and
it works OK. May be U can explain how U init your coplist as I think 
there's the problem. Thanx!

Hi all!

Does anybody (ACID :) know the structure of CopList (new display lib).
What I want to do is some kewl 256 colour fade effects.
Just wondered if I know the palette data offsets in coplist then
can I just  poke new colour values into it?? Any ideas??

Hello all. I have just joined the blitz list. I have a 
number of points to make, and hope that someone
can answer them.

1) SUSPECTED BUG
===============

Type the following program :

	ss.q=2
	dd.l=834000
	NPrint ss-dd/1000 ;output will be 19.968
	dd.l=40000
	NPrint ss-dd/1000 ;output will be 27.536
	dd.l=30000
	NPrint ss-dd/1000 ;output will be -28

As you see, the results are not always correct. The
problem appears to be that if a number is outside the
quick range, then the compiler tries to make it quick,
but doesn`t get it right. Although it is possible to 
devise a workaround, I would at least expect the
signalling of an error. At best, the problem could be 
fixed.

I telephoned Acid Software in Britain, but there is no
technical support there. They said I could write to
New Zealand. As you can imagine, I find
this fairly naff.  Is there any way that I can contact 
someone to have it fixed? Do the developers read this 
list?



2) A DIFFERENT SUSPECTED BUG
==========================

This time in string handling. I think that this is a more
serious error, because it makes string parsing and
outputting more problematical. Type the following:

	a$="  "  ;two spaces
	for i=1 to 2
 	   NPrint Asc(mid$(a$,i,1))
	next i
	NPrint len(a$)
	Mousewait

The output is:
	32
	32
	2

So far, so good. Now type:
	
	Screen 0,10
	window 0,0,0,200,200,0,"Oops",0,1
	windowoutput 0
	a$=lset$("abc",5)
	for i=1 to 5
	   Nprint asc(mid$(a$,i,1))
	next i
	nprint len(a$)
	mousewait

Output is :
	97
	98
	99
	0     <- wrong !
	32
	5
	abc*

You get an ugly output, and things are generally wrong.
There is also a problem with the STRING$ function. 
Again - how can I bring these errors to the
developer's attention and get them fixed?



3) MAKEDEFLIBS
=============

When I try to load the MAKEDEFS program, I get a 
message saying "Not enough memory". The computer
then guru's on me.

Currently my blitzlibs drawer is a mess - filled with
.res and .bb files all over the place. It is my opinion
that Blitz Basic should not have been supplied in
compressed format. Does anyone feel the same about
the User Magazine? I would rather pay just a bit more
to have EVERYTHING decompressed. After all, I have
to use extra disks to store decompressed files. Even then,
I might find .lha files within them. This amounts to a 
massive sortout operation. From the user's point of
view, there is no economic savings in being
supplied with compressed disks - quite the reverse.
Does anyone agree?


4) POINTERS
==========

It appears that the pointers work in a different way from
C pointers. Am I right? Is it possible, in a SAFE way,
to get the list to point to a particular element? I
know that you can specify indices in a list, e.g.
	a(1)\object  (where a() is a list),
but the manual advises against it.
I want to be able to set up a proper pointer so that I 
can write a tree-processing routine. I want to be
able to write something like :

	*remember = current list position
	...
	process the list using NextItem()
	...
	set current list poistion = *remember
	... maybe make use of NextItem()

Do you understand what I mean? Is it possible?


6) AMIGADOS
============

Admittedly not a Blitz question, but I hope you will
help me anyway.

Suppose I write a file called "input" containing:
	1  2
	3  4
	5  6
I would like to process it to produce 
	2
	4
	6
Not very ambitious, I know, but I want to do it as a
learning exercise. I thought of writing a file called 
"script" containing :
	.key a b
	echo $b
and execute it using
	execute sript <input
It doesn't work! So my questions are:
	(i)   how do I pass parameters to a script?
	(ii)  how do I set and print a  variable?



7) UP/DOWN LOADING FILES
========================

I saw interest in previous letters about uploading and
downloading blitz programs. I have some programs 
that people may find interesting. Some of the
programs use binary data, so it is not possible to 
transmit all of them as ASCII files. I do have UUENCODE.
The problem is knowing how to transmit/receive binary 
files on  the Internet. I use the university's computer,
and we are on JANET, but not Internet. Although I
can send ASCII text vial email to any Internet address,
I cannot do the same with binary files.

I can get a guest_ftp on nsf.sun (nothing to do with
my university) and an ftpmailserver at Imperial
College (again, it's nothing to do with my
university).

So my question is : Is there any chance of me 
transferring files over the Internet?

Supplementary question : can anyone send me "Green 
Five"? It was reviewed in Amiga Format, and got an
exceptional review. I know that this list is the slightly
wrong place to ask for this sort of thing - but I am
too tight to spend  1.50 {it seems that some PD
companies (no inference intended about 17 Bit
Software - the advertisers of "Green Five") 
distribute software not on a particularly
not-for-profit basis}.

The best way to get the hang of Copperlists with Blitz (I find) is to
write a little Copper disassembler. Then setup the display as necessary
and view the Copper List with it

To do this scan through the memory adresses from CopLoc to CopLoc +
CopLen step 4, decode the pairs of words at these addresses.

For adr.l=CopLoc to CopLoc+CopLen Step 4
 word1.w=peek.w(adr)
 word2.w=peek.w(adr+2)
 ...
Next

The lowest bits tell you the type of Copper command,a nd the other bits
give the data and adresses. See the Blitz manual appendix, and interpret
the results as you go. Then you can make up a table of useful data
adresses for your particular Coper list set-up,a nd poke new data e.g.
colours into these values.

If enough people want me to, ill post my own Copper disassembler here.

Hi all Blitzers!

I've written a game called SpaceMan that I would like some
of you people to give me some input on(Acid is also welcome).
The game was written for the AF-compo but it didn't win. It's an
isometric shoot-em-up game in 32 colours. The game still have some bugs
of which most I'm aware of. 

I want some of you to take a look at the game and give me some
comments about gameplay, looks, sound bugs etc. The reason is that I'm going
to develop a fully-featured shareware version with some 50 levels or
so for a meagre 10 pence a level( or distribute it on one of Acids future gamediscs if they want to). The final game should also have a couple of extra features.

So mail me if you feel that you have a couple of minutes to spare on a little bit of gametesting. The game comes with the sourcecode and about ten levels although some of them are poorly designed. I can mention the fact that the levels are designed in Dpaint and that each level can consist of as many as 100 sectors or rooms.
I will probably send the game on a floppydisk. It should work on A500, A2000, A1200, A3000 and A4000 although sometimes it does some strange things with its screens.
 
Mail me your postal adress together with a short presentation and I'll contact you as soon as I can.

A quicky question to you all,

Anyone know a way of freeing off memory used by a 'DIM LIST' a sort of UNDIM
I suppose. The reason is a program I am working on at the moment requires an
extremely large list array purely to display a large GTListview which the
user selects an Item from, then that's it.. list finished, but I've still
lost all that memory, till the program terminates. I realise I could write
my own fake listview but it seems a lot of effort for one selection.

While I am on it, once you get the value of the selected item from the list
is it possible to set the listpointer to that entry, so you can get at the
data at that position, I'm currently starting at the beginning and using
NextItem() to step through the number of entries specified by the listview,
which works but isn't ideal..

Thanks in advance.

>1) SUSPECTED BUG
>===============
 (Rounding Bug)

To be honest, what you are attempting here is a bit dodgy in itself, the
golden rule is usually like with like, this way the compiler does not have
to work out what result you are after. This goes for most languages. Blitz
is a bit different in that it implements a quick (but less accurate)
datatype. If you need accuracy I'd try Floats instead.

Still its not bad for a small NZ outfit, you should try getting support from
some UK companies.... Sheer hell.

>Is there any way that I can contact
>someone to have it fixed? Do the developers read this 
>list?
They certainly do, as do many other Blitz developers.

>2) A DIFFERENT SUSPECTED BUG
>==========================
 (String handling)
Yep this is known, and I think Acid are suitably embarrassed by it, I think
it got in on the last upgrade, and (according to all reports) they are
working on it as we speak.

>You get an ugly output, and things are generally wrong.
>There is also a problem with the STRING$ function.
Is that the one where it doesn't put the right no. of charaters in the
string ? Can't remember if I reported it. Sure the guys will know though.

>Again - how can I bring these errors to the
>developer's attention and get them fixed?
Hey man, your doing it....

>3) MAKEDEFLIBS
>=============
>
>When I try to load the MAKEDEFS program, I get a 
>message saying "Not enough memory". The computer
>then guru's on me.
Do you mean load or run the 'makedefs' program, If it is loading you got a
real problem, if it is when it is run it could be down to the junk you
mention in your Blitzlibs drawer. I am sure if you ask, nicely BUM7 will
contain a blitzlibs draw with just those files needed. (I would be very much
in favour of this ;-) ) just clear out the .res and .bb* files and things
should be OK. (I take it you are running makedeflibs to include new
libraries ? Otherwise you never need it.

>Currently my blitzlibs drawer is a mess - filled with
>.res and .bb files all over the place. It is my opinion

>Does anyone feel the same about the User Magazine?
Naa, sorry I'd prefer to keep Acid's costs to a minimum, so they can keep
churning out updates and the like.

>4) POINTERS
>==========
>Is it possible, in a SAFE way, to get the list to point to a particular
>element? I know that you can specify indices in a list, e.g.

I don't know about this one but if you find out let me know, I would love to
use this to set a position in a list to the entry selected from a
GTListview.

>6) AMIGADOS
>============
Nope sorry I'm no help here at all. (use MSDOS too much)


One final comment, while I am here. You do seem to be a bit negative about
Acid (appologies if I have the wrong end of the stick here). Although I am
not defending them (after all they are selling a product) I do feel that
they do a good job considering the size of their operation. As I said
earlier I have had much worse service from many big (and some bloody
massive) companies in the UK.

If nothing else you've got access to the Blitz-list, which seems to have a
wealth of knowledge flowing round it these days. Ask a question and usually
someone will answer it. There are some people developing some wonderful
libraries etc, (although I hope the latest RIBlitzlibs get onto aminet soon)
so usually someone can help you.

All the best

WOW, it worked, I think Blitz must be the first Language I have used which
allows you to redim so easily, in fact it was so simple I didn't even think
about this solution. Mucho Thanks for suggesting it.

I don't think I was too clear in my description :-( I can read the Listview
no problem but I then want to take that value and set the List array pointer
to point to the entry selected. I am currently using something similar to
the following:

   ok=firstitem(mylist())
   while(lv1>0)
      ok=nextitem(mylist())
      lv1=lv1-1
   wend

therefore at the end of the loop the List array will point at the Listview
entry selected.... Great for small lists, But could take a while on a larger
array. I was just wondering if there was a way to set the pointer directly.

many thanks for the assistance Joel, appreciate it.

Howdy all Blitzers,

I'm in Australia and was wondering how much Blitz 2 costs
in America or Europe as it not easliy avialable in Australia,
and it will probably be cheaper..

Or is someone selling a second hand version i could buy?

Thanx in adv,
Keith.

Hi All,

I am starting to develope a fairly large program ( a soccer management sim ) 
using Blitz. Having barely got the project off the ground, I have already 
written some 2000+ lines of code, currently all in one source file which is 
becoming unmanagable.

If I were developing in 'C' (my native language) a lot of this would already be
in sub modules or libraries.

I know that blitz can have resident files containing NewTypes and Constants,
is it possible to produce libraries of procedures / statements or else 
compile multiple files simultaneously ?

Do you use the MAKEDEFLIBS command ?  Could somebody explain how this works ?

Many Thanks,

-Andy

Hi all,

        I was looking at blitz last night and came up with the following
problems.....(note:The last ver of BUM I have is 5-if that makes a
difference)


        1. I looked at the crunch.obj file and saw some commands such as
PPDecrunch, CRMDecrunch, Implode and Deplode.  But no documentation
anywhere.  The commands are recognised in blitz, but I tried using
PPdecrunch to unpack a PP20 file but had no luck.


        2. How can I access a checkbox value without using the gadptr
structure. I know I can use eventcode, but I dont wish to update a variable
every time its changed. Is there a way of doing the following.....

        var.l=eventcode(gtlist#,id)   ??????


        3. AGAIN, I found a problem in using statements/functions,
the following works in the main program, but not in a function....

        r.l=0
        a.l=20
        getreg d0,a
        putreg d0,r

        As you might expect, r returns 20, but in a function it returns 0!!

        Also ASLFilerequest$ GURUS inside a statement.




Thanx a lot.

Matt.

Date sent: 17-AUG-1994 

Just thought I'd mail the list with a couple of updates to my map editor.

The editor now sports an OPTIONAL shape scroller at the top of the screen. 
This stretches across the whole width of the screen and allows you to quickly
select any shape in the currently loaded file.  It can be switched on or off
and its status can be saved as a tooltype.

You can now save your prefered screen mode.  The editor will automatically open
its screen to match your choice.

Shapes can now be grabbed from IFF's using the LoadShapes menu item.  Just
click on an IFF instead of a shapes file and you'll be given a option to grab
the palette from the iff, the program will then automatically cut out the
shapes and then resort them as if they were a normal shapes file.

Shapes can now be named!  Give a shape a name and then save out all defined
names as an ASCII file that looks like this:

			#BACKGROUND=0
			#DESTRUCT=1
			#NONDESTRUCT=2

These constants can then be used straight in your program - making it easier to
change your shapes file in the future!  You can also select a shape by name
rather than by number or image.

Hmmmmm..... Anything else?  Probably but I'll be buggered if I can
remember......... ;-)

Oh well, the editor should be available soon!


Thanx,

Steve Mc.

I'll gladly do that for you... Same goes for anyone else who'd like
a very honest/critical pre-release review.  Shall also touch up on
any gfx that make me wanna puke. :)  (if desired and/or accessable)

cool, either that or upload to my BBS, ( 61-75-382097 ), logon with:
"guest", password "guest".

Otherwise just mail me and something else could be arranged.

Hi all,

Another question.

The program I am writing at the moment has a large array of a newtype which
I want to save to disk. I have'nt got the code with me but I have the following
questions,

1. Does OpenFile create a file if it does'nt exist, or do you need WriteFile,
or both ?

2. Having opened the file (Write/OpenFile having returned success) I then use
the commands,

	
	Field 0,clubs
	Put 0,0

	where the variable clubs is,

	newtype .team
	{

		some .b types
		some .player (newtypes)
	}

	Dim clubs.team(22)

Is this the correct way of saving this data to disk ?

3. On a different note, I started coding by writing code directly into the 
editor attached to the Blitz2 compiler. Last night I tried using Ted and 
found that all the reserved words ie Newtype, Print, WLocate etc., where
garbled. Is it possible to save code from within the Blitz compiler in such
a fashion that Ted can undewrstand it ? 

Thanks

-Andy

Hi All,

I wonder if somebody found this bug:

WBenchToFront_
WbStartup
Window 0,0,0,640,200,$0800,"Hi!",1,2
a$=Edit$(a$,25)

When you run this program it will put the cursor on screen with a 
Null-character in it (a character like this: [])...

 I don't know if this is really what you want, but it might give you
 ideas.  This code uses the blitter directly to move data around a
 bitplane, and could simulate the effect you are after.
 
 This code runs under Intuition, but I didn't bother protecting myself
 with a call to OwnBlitter() and DisownBlitter().  The routines adapt
 themselves to whatever strange bitmaps you care to toss at it, and even
 works on my 4000/040 here at work.
 
 Regards,
 
 Neil

Here we go, the Copper disassembler.

End Function

  RD=clist(i,1)
  Nprint i*4," Move ",h{DA}," #"h{RD}

  VE=(clist(i,1)ASR8)&127:HP=(clist(i,1)&254)ASL1
  If clist(i,1)&1=0;Wait Instruction
   Nprint i*4," Wait(",HP,",",VP,")("HE,",",VE,")"
  Else
   NPrint i*4," Skip(",HP,",",VP,")("HE,",",VE,")"
  Endif
 Endif
Next

And there we have it. I'd check the h Function - it is intended to give
neat hex output

Anyway, the output looks something like

0 Wait(0,44)(255,255)
4 Move 180 #fff
etc.

The Wait means that the Copper waits until the video beam reaches the
coordinates (0,44) after being logically AND ed with the mask (255,255)
It then Pokes he value fff into the Register $180 (which I believe is
the address for Colour 0 on the ECS chipset.

To change the data being poked in Poke the new word into the address 
CopLoc+4(figure on left of disasm output)+2(1 word)

i.e. Poke.w CopLoc+6,$ff0 would change Colour 0 to Yellow.

The typical Copper list will have a Wait at the top of each Slice, then
a lot of Pokes into the Colour Table, Sprite Registers and BPLMods and
so on, all of which are listed in the back of the Blitz manual.
To change the Y value for waits, Poke the new y as a byte  into the
address given by CopLoc+number on left. This can be used to e.g. move a
ColSplit up and down the screen, but make sure that all waits are still
in strict numerical order of y values. 

           Happy Poking
                Mike Cooper

Hi all!

I (we in fact) have my first blitz project almost finished
so next problem is the distribution. What I need is PD BBS numbers
all over the wolrd. As the list subscribers actually are from
very different countries then if it's not trouble to
you, please mail (directly to me) couple of popular BBS numbers
+ some comments if you know any (login names, passwords if needed 
etc.) in your area (+ contry code too ;). If anybody is interested
then I can mail this full BBSlist to Blitzlist. Thanx! Bye for now!

I would like to compose a colour requester window in Blitz Basic.
I know that  a combination of Red Green and Blue can be used
to make a colour. There is also an alternative arrangement - using
Hue Saturation and Value. My question is - what is the specific
(i.e. can you give me the mathematical relationship)
between RGB and HSV ?

Hi folks,

Just like to thank everybody on the list for the great feedback for 
my game StarWoids, all the advice is greatly appreciated.

Work on the full version is progressing nicely, the only drawback 
being that we have now decided to drop all references to starwars in 
the game, both in the sound and graphics. Lets just say we had a talk 
with somebody close to LucasArts, and they advised us to play it safe 
so to speak 8)

That will mean an extra couple of weeks delay, but hopefully the 
final version will be ready soon.

Thanks again.

Hi folks,

I have been meaning to ask this for ages, but I have always forgotten 
in the past. Basically, I know the blitz docs say you must insert a 
vwait 250 before jumping into blitz mode after disk accesses.

But, is this really necessary. Because of this, my games sometimes 
has long pauses, particularly when loading in levels, which is very 
irritating.

Is there any way of getting around it, or are we stuck with it??

Thanks.

I tried this command, but my Blitz basic doesn't recognize it.  Where

Hello everyone.

I was wondering if someone would be able to give me a little Arexx
class.  I had an idea about creating a Full Screen Editor for my
BBS.  If I program it in Blitz Basic ][, I would need to access the
port that AmiExpress (the BBS program) uses called: AEDoorPort1.
I've read the info contained in BUM mag # 2 about the Arexx commands
but I find that it's a little vague to someone who doesn't really know
what Arexx is all about.  I've programmed dozens of Arexx utilities
for my BBS, but that was easy, I never had to send Arexx messages and
reply to them etc.

Ok, so here is the help I need:  How do I use Blitz ][ Arexx commands!?
I don't understand the message structures that I have to create, with
those 16 argstrings or whatever that are, on page 30 of BUM #2.
And I also to get the command (action) codes on page 33.  They say to
replay the mnemonics with their values, but WHAT ARE THEIR VALUES?
All in all, what kind of process do I have to follow to make my
Blitz Program communicate with my BBS Program?

Nelson.

Er -- Don't use it ... I tried it out and it does not work for some
reason.  I think the interrupt approach would be better (I remember
seeing a Disk DMA interrupt bit in INTREQR somewhere).  Let me have a go

Hi folks!

I just got BUM 6 and I was wondering if there's any way to get the shape editor
on the archive disk working on a 1200.  It needs the speech library,
apparently, even though the speech is a "useless function".  Bloody
brilliant...  :P

Also, has anyone had any luck compiling the 3D shape editor on an unexpanded
A1200?  Or am I gonna have to get me some more memory...  :)

I thought I'd send it to the blitz-list to see if the proper

I downloaded your blitzlibs library from the aminet. It contains the

version of the library?

Thanks,

Hi guys and gals.

Yesterday, a nasty little bug crept into my game, and I'm damned if I 
now what it is. When playing my game, and then exiting back to WB, WB 
appears okay as usual, but it runs very slow. When I checked with the 
realtime monitor to see what was running, I noticed that my game was 
still running and active, although all memory had been freed. This 
happens every time I run it now, either from the editor or from the 
icon.

My only idea was that maybe it was an interupt left running, but I've 
checked my code thoroughly, and I'm sure its not this (I only use int 
5 for playing mods anyway).

Does anybody have any ideas?? 

Thanks.

  Someone asked about the relationship between RGB and HSV...

  The following algorithm converts from RGB (normalised from 0 to 1) to
  HSV (taken from "Interactive computer graphics" - Burger and Gillies):



  maxcol=MAX(red,green,blue)
  mincol=MIN(red,green,blue)
  value=maxcol
  IF (maxcol=mincol)
    saturation=0
    ; Hue is undefined, colour is white, grey or black
  ELSE
    saturation=(MaximumComponent-MinimumComponent)/MaximumComponent   ***
    IF (mincol=blue)
      hue=120*(green-mincol)/(red+green-2*mincol)
    ELSE IF (mincol=red)
      hue=120*(1+(blue-mincol)/(blue+green-2*mincol))
    ELSE
      hue=120*(2+(red-mincol)/(red+blue-2*mincol))
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

*** I'm not sure what it means by Maximum and MinimumComponent, maybe it
    just means maxcol and mincol?


 -Matthew.

Apologies for going over an old subject, but.....

Can anyone give me a full list of problems that OS2.0 has with dealing with
gadtools.  I would really like my editor to be able to run on OS2.0 but I do
not know exactly what I can and can't do.  I have already removed the use of
GTGetAttrs commands - is there anything else I need to do?

Hi All

I've just been messing with DisplayLib and I can set up a 320x256x8
display, but I really want to fade a bitmap on and off it. FadeIn and
FadeOut don't work, is there an alternative?

It came with the blitz...your blitz then doesn't know nothing about
med player commands either or what?? What you need is
medlib.obj in your blitzlibs:basic (or in your deflib).
--- OTT -----------------------------------------------------------

Yes, I Have medlib.obj in the basic directory, and all the other
med commands are recognized, but "CludgeMedModule" is not there!
Are you sure that is the way you spell it, try it and tell me if
if works for you...

My mistake.

Recently I claimed that the RIBlitzLibsV3_1.lha failed to contain the
'.OBJ' files. This is my mistake - they do exist - but one must
'Show All Icons'. I could die from embarrassment.



Sorry that I have to make a response through Blitz-list, but for some unknown
reason my mail-daemon doesn't recognise your address (I have tried it
several times).

At last! Communication with other Blitzers. Deep joy.

I have been using Blitz2 for a few months now. I`m currently running v 1.8
(Ted v 1.1) which came off BUM6 a few weeks ago.

Mostly it runs on a A4000/30 (kick 39.106, wb 39.29 {i.e. V3.0}) and seems fine.

I`ve just moved the system onto our trusty A2000 (running kick 37.175 and wb 
38.35
{i.e. V2.1 on 2.04 rom}). It`s also got loads of boards in it.

Blitz seems to behave differently on the 2 systems. ie it`s wobbly on the 2000.
The simplest prog I could think of to test it was:

loop:
  a$=edit$(1)
  If a$<>"q" Then Goto loop

and when compile/run`ed if you resize the default window and double click on 
a WB
icon (like a disc f`rincetance) it doesn`t open. When you click back on the 
Blitz
window the pointer locks up completely, not even a guru!!

So far I`ve disabled the (admittedly iffy) Fusion 40 accelerator and run it 
without
the startup-sequence.

Before I start ripping _all_ the other stuff out of the machine (PAR, GVP SCSI,
a very old C= memory board (hmmm), Heggie-net ... er that`s it) and my hair...
can anyone suggest an easier solution?

(and while I`m here) the GadTools listviews seem to work differently too 
(like not)

Apologies for arriving with a problem but thanks in advance

Japan, Canada, Mexico, bits of Russia seem to aswell. Actually, I think
only the UK and Australia/NZ use PAL, everybody else uses SECAM (europe)
or NTSC.

Why not force the machine into PAL mode?

Does anybody still reading this list...
Something seems to be wrong coz I get 3-4 days old messages
and ...well it's good if 1-2 messages per day arrives :(
(2-3 weeks ago everything was quite normal - atleast 10 or more
msg per day was sure thing)
Is somethign wrong with the listserver or the # of subscribers

Hi fellow Blitzers!

I am having a little trouble with understanding how to play modules. I am
working on a program that will read a script file with names of modules and
then play them one after another.

My problem is how to know when a module ends so I can start the next one.
How do I get my program to wait for the first module to end in a system
friendly way before going on to the next?

I have this little skeleton code that doesn't work as I want it to:

Hi all!

I have major problems with the memory fragmentation. 
Has anyone (acid) any idea what to do to keep largest
block of free mem as big as possible. Every time
my program quits largest block decreases ca 300-400 K (chip)
I alloc some huge bitmaps and then free them + 
allocating some memory too. But I free everything correctly.
So is this Blitz's problem or am I doing something wrong?
I hope there is solution for this coz otherwise I cant
do my load level routine more that 3 times - then there just
ain't any free mem (well if you use avail command is shell
then it says 1.8 M free chip but largest block is 200 K).
So please anybody help.

I think that this list is alive but that it's merely taking a nap. The same was true for the Amos list a couple of months ago but now it's bursting with energy. Just keep on writing those letters and we'll see :-) .

About simulating the spinning wheels of a slot machine...Is it that they should rotate with amazing speed that is the problem or what? Here comes a very rough explanation:
I guess that you alraeady have the shapes for each and every kind of token on a wheel (about ten or twelwe maybe?). Blit the shapes on a bitmap in the vertical direction. Then decide how much you can see through the window in the slotting machine. E.g If your window is 60 pxls in height and a token is 20 pxls then you should be able to display up to three tokens in that window. The thing to do is to cut out a shape from your token bitmap that is exactly the same size as your window and then display it in that window. The cuttingposition is equal to the wheel position. There is a bit more to this and I will be glad to help you with it if you want to :-).

Hi! Yes is's me again. Seems like I kinda write replys to myself...
Hmm..well anyway...some problems still remain, I hope some
competent user (or acid) reads this coz as far as I know
one must know what really happens inside blitz if bitmap is
allocated etc.

Warning! This msg is longer than 1 page!

Situation is this:

NB! Before this certain loader routine there are main 
code, several sub progs plus some init code etc..

.xxx: ; - loader routine

; check 1
Free Bitmap 0
; check 2
Bitmap 0,xx,yy,8
; check 3
Now if I do this routine twice (means that I really have bitmap 
to be freed) then the free mem after second try shows like this
Note! The numbers are not important. I just want to show the
difference between them.

First largest blocks free (chipfree)
check 1 - old BM is allocated =665280
check 2 - old BM freed        =665280
check 3 - new MB created      =665280

Second freechip  - AvailMem_(#CHIP)
check 1 - old BM is allocated =725272
check 2 - old BM freed        =992544
check 3 - new BM created      =725272

- - - - - 

So it seems like the free bitmap is not freeing the memory.

Then again if I try this bitmap thing outside my proggy
like this:

BitMap 0,xx,yy,8 ; make a bitmap so we can free it 
; check 1 ; old BM in mem
Free BitMap 0
; check 2 ; old BM freed
BitMap 0,xx,yy,8
;check 3 ; new allocated
-----
If I print checks out (both largest and full free mem)
then both will be freed and everythign is ok.

Funny thing is that if I compile my full program to file
and then run it then every time I call my loader routine
I loose some mem (ca 400K!!! da valuable chip mem to be exact)
But if I quit the program then all will be freed and all
memory is given back.

So in blitz cleanup procedure (when quiting proggy) the freeing is 
done. Question is? Can I somehow force blitz to make some cleanup
during program run? May sound stupid but I just can't figure out
what the hell is going on? Help me out please!

	Uh uh, NTSC is largely used in the Americas and Japan. PAL is
the standard everywhere else with the exception of the ex-Soviet Union
and France where SECAM and its derivatives are used.

	Agreed, the colours are much better. And you'll get a much
larger share of the Amiga market that way.

Hi all(or is it just OTT left?)


        I've written a short program(star scrolly thing) that I want to put
on a boot block loader.  I have the routines to put things on blocks of the
disk and to call them at certain address from the boot-block itself.

        The Program loads - does not crash, but just sits there, a blank
screen and nothing else.  I've relocated everything to a base address then
called that address from the loader code.

        Does anything else need to be done?????

But if the NTSC user is using TV set for monitor then the TV will

I had same idea in mind. Can you explain a bit this bitmap cludge'ing.
I had some problems with it. What exactly does this cludgebitmap 
command want? Addres of a bitmap itself or the whole bitmap object 
structure? Must I create my own bitmap struct by hand?? Hmm..yes
here comes my other question. Someone explained once this but I lost
this msg so here it comes. How can I create blitz objects without
useing blitz commands to allocate them. For example I think it's not 
wise to  oad 10 samples one by one into memory. Instead I thought I 
link all samples into one piece, alloc some chip and load linked 
samples into it. Here's the problem - how I suppose to tell blitz that 
I have sound object #1 starting from addr x, sound #2 startting from
x+z etc.??

So if need to cludge bitmap I do next??

1. Alooc chip
2. Load pure bitmpadata into it
3. Cludge bitmap #, addr,x,y etc.

Now I should have bitmap obkect created by cludgebitmap. Am I right?

Tried it first, no joy. I think it`s more system`y than that.

This one came through my personal mail, I hope Mr Funnell doesn`t
mind me posting the reply to the list
(just in case there`s anyone else reading it / interested)

BUM6 came through the post. (I bought Blitz2 from Amiga Format`s special offer
several months ago) IntuiTools2 is quite useable now!!
I don`t beleive I`m allowed to upload this as it`s the full working version
but hows about Acid uploads an upgrade kit to AmiNet (and the rest of the BUMs
while you`re at it.) with some sort of encryption / key needed to unpack it??

While I`m here (and may have the attention of someone at Acid)
        Any chance of getting the compiler to run from CED (or similar) (btw
                                what`s the point of tokenised script files,
                                they seem to take up almost as much disc space
                                and can`t be read by anything else ?)
        Has anyone got results back from ARexx commands (like ADPRO_RESULT??)
                                apart from writing them to ENV vars and 
opening them
                                as DOS files (Kludge-tastic)
        Oh yes, ASLRequesters within Functions seem to lock up big time (?).
        ...and many, mant more

Apart from that...excellent language, good list (what I`ve seen of it so far),
        enjoy.


Just read today`s mail list, V1.9...WHERE???

        yours (hoping not to have to re-learn C)

Well...good you mentioned the full path - now I know where I

  Has anyone managed to get 'BitPlanesBitmap' to work?
  I think the syntax is:

      BitPlanesBitmap SrcBitmap,DestBitmap,Bitplane

  What sort of argument should 'Bitplane' be? Just a number like 0,1 or 2?

  Say I've got a 3 plane bitmap with some shapes on it, some of them in 
  colour 1.  How do I copy this bitmap to a different 1 plane bitmap, so the
  new bitmap has only the shapes in colour 1 on it?

I don`t think it`s that because it does the same crash in progs without edit$
I only used edit$ because I thought it would be fairly likely to be stable :)
I sure it would do the same with...

loop:
        Goto loop

I`ll try it when I can get on the 2000

Speed?  Ha!  Try using the sisvax!

Cool little game..... ;-)

I'll try and get something sorted out over the next week.
A new release of the ZoneJoy library is nearly ready.  It supports 020
instructions (i.e. CMP2) and has had the joystick testing routines enchanced to
remove unnecessary code and sloppy work ;-).
Hopefully I'll be testing the lib out, then once I've done exhaustive testing
(e.g. about 10 mins) I'll go some updating docs for it.

Note:  The 020 testing is switch on or offable BUT you can obviously only
switch it on if you have a 68020 in your Amiga.

Great work from Jurgen!  I've got the guide installed on my machine and have it
available at a touch of a key.  Everyone should have a copy ;-).

TO MARTIN:
~~~~~~~~~~

  I have been unable to mail you directly.  I have, though, placed a message in
your ftp site named TOMARTIN.TXT.  Read this and delete it please.  Anyone else
can read it as well but I don't think you'll get too much out of it ;-).


Bye-bye from me,

Steve Mc.

Hi folks,

Just to say that my ftp site is now open. If you have any blitz stuff 
you want to put on it, simply log in and download, making sure to 
include a txt file too..

IMPORTANT: This ftp site is based on a crappy novell system, so only 
8.3 filenames are allowed!!! 8( So no .readme files (they won't 
work), just .txt files (eg. myprog.txt).

Currently the ftp site is only one directory, but I'll hopefully 
structure it a bit better as soon as I have time, adding a blitz dir
etc etc. If you have a new version of a blitz program already on the 
site, you cannot upload over the top of the old one, or delete it. 
So either call the new one by a different name (and I'll sort it 
out), or upload to the incoming dir which I'll eventually create!!

WARNING:

1. This site is only available during UK office working hours, sorry.
2. Its not a speedy site, so please don't abuse it. I'm only 
providing it as a service to fellow blitzers. If problems arise due 
to misuse or cronic over use (which will slow my PC down - which my 
boss won;t be too happy about, and its slow enough anyway 8^), then I 
may withdraw it. So no complaints about the speed, its the speed you 
see, and nothing will change that...

Anyway, have fun. 

Currently on the board are:

1. Starwoids (dms). Oldish version actually, but I'll leave it there.
2. RILibs. This is newer than the one on aminet, but not the newist! 
Steve, upload with all speed.
3. BlitzGuide. Again, not the newish I don't think, but again, upload 
the new one if you want Jurgen.


slow enough already

Damn, I forgot to give the address again didn't I, sigh...

Its cekift.swan.ac.uk, and login as anonymous.

P.S. I you get an error msg when connecting like 'cannot connect' or 
whatever, this could either mean that the server is off-line for a 
while, or it could equally mean that there are too many login's. This 
system is crap at error-msgs.

Anyway, thats enough bandwidth from me...

Sorry for *yet another* ftp site post, I'll keep it short...

I've now structured my ftp site a tad better. When you login, you'll 
see this directory structure:

  >games
  >blitz
     >libs
     >docs
  >incoming 

Please upload to incoming only, and include a text file describing 
the thing you are uploading. If what you are uploading doesn't fit 
into an existing dir, then I'll probably create a new one for it...

I'll create a readme file too, with a full dir listing.....

So upload those files, lets fill this site with some nice stuff, 
mainly blitz stuff. Since I'm limiting the size tho, I'm not going to 
fill it with music and demos etc, mostly blitz related material...

Sounds COOOL to me! Just one question (to ACID). Do the registered 
users get this upgrade free? If no then what do I have to do to get 
it? I was about to release my game but as 1.9 is on it's way (I hope)
I guess I'll wait a bit. CU!

A question to anybody out there who uses the ZoneJoy library from Reflective
Images.

For the latest version of the libary I have had to do a little reshuffling of
how the zones were held in memory.  This was to enable to library too use the
020 instruction CMP2.  This reshuffling means that old programs that use the
library and access the zone table directly will no longer work.

I am interested in whether or not people will actually mind about this change,
or whether the benefits of 020 support outway the disadvantage of a bit of
rewriting.  What do you think?

New instructions in the library:


			ZonesMode - ask if zonetesting is on 68000 or 68020 mode.
			SetZonesMode - set the zonestesting mode.

  The library also checks what processor you have when it is initialised and
automatically sets the mode to 020 if you have one fitted.

Hi all,

Is there a special command for executing commands or do I have to
use the function from the exec library ??

Hi all!

Yet another annoying bug found.
Just want to confirm this thing - maybe it's just my fault.
Thing is that sometimes when loading some stuff into mem
(QAMIGA mode) machine crashes, not that it reboots but
HD led stays on and it just hangs. Funny thing is 
that everything seems like working (pressing CTRL C will bring up 
debugger screen) but HD led still stays on - nothing will be readed 
though. From debugger it's now impossible to return to Ted
only reboot helps. What sux is that this thing is not traceable,
meaning that sometimes it crashes and sometime it doesn't.
Lets say...1 from 10 will crash.
The problems occur when Bloading stuff so maybe it's RIlibs fault.
Then again my mate said he had same problems with LoadShapes command
too. Maybe it has something to do with specific HD (I haven't tested 
it on floppy) or maybe it's Blitz bug. Comments? Has anyone had
problems like this?? Bye!

                O.T.T. (ott@microlnk.ml.ee)
