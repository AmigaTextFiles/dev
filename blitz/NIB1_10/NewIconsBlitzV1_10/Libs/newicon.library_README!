 NEWICON.LIBRARY
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

 The newicon.library comes with all versions of newicons,..
 At the time of writing this, the current version is V4.5 (NewIcon
 package) and V40.1.

 NEWICONS CAN BE GOT FROM:

   o AFCD
   o CUCD
   o AmiNet
   o NewIcons HOME: http://www.amiganet.org/NewIcons/

 I am not sure about the legal (licence) for the newicon.library,
 and the docs aren`t to good with this. I advise you check the
 NI docs and then the Author.

 CHOW!
 Rob.
