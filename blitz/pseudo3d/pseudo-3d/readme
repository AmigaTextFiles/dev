Kurz:     Pseudo3D basisroutine (BlitzBasic2)

This is a pseudo-3d engine like the 3d engines in classic RPGs 
(e.g. Ishar, Crystals of Arborea, etc.). It's only a very simple example 
how you can create such engine. For example I've finished all graphic 
stuff within 2 h.... and it's very old: it was one of my first projects... 
and I never finished it :)

For correct fontpath use the "add_assign" script.

Feel free to improve..... yes, it's 100% free..... :)
