						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

From: Bernd Roesch <berndroesch1@...>
Date: 09-16-02 16:58:20
Subject: @{b}& Operator "and" Operator diffrent priority@{ub}

Hi, all

The & do the same than "and" but using  & instead of "and" is not possible
because priority is diffrent

a*b+4 and 4  same (a*b+4) & 4

if (a and  4)=2  same if a & 4=2    


In C the priority of && is same as "and" in AB2.A simular to & does not
exist in C 
Does someone use & instead "and" ?

If not i think it is best to make & simular to "and" in all Modes 

With "or" and | it is the same

Bye

Isn't the & a bitwise "and", as in C?  It's been a while but I thought
Blitz had this feature.

Taking from my PureBasic manual I'm using this:
Logical Operators (And, Or)
Bitwise Operators (&  |  !  ~  <<  >>)

For Blitz should be true the same...

a*b+4 and 4  same (a*b+4) & 4

if (a and  4)=2  same if a & 4=2   

This give same Assembler Code

In c there is no way to write terms like & but for compatibility i think i
leave it as it is so you can not replace the and word with &

From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>

Subject: @{b}all.res and mui.res@{ub}

Hi all!

I know that I asked this question once, but
I have no sulution yet, so:

I have a programm using all.res.
Now it needs mui.res because I want to use mui.
mui.res contains incompatible definitions to all.res.

So I can not use them both because they define
the same things. But if Iuse mui.res it says e.g. ".Screen" instead
of "._Screen". So what can I do now ?

Is there a mui.res without the OS struktures or is there
a compatible mui.res ?

BTW.: I can not change the newtype names because
parts of the program are use by other programms (it s
an include). I would have to change all progs, but this
is impossible.

Ciao,
Thilo

I get source of newest amiga.res from David.I add then also needed _Screen
types... so the incompatibilty is gone (i hope)

But for now 

amigalibs.res from Davids 2.26 is newest one  

Attached are the all.bb2 file.You can use this with amigalibs.res if you
dont need Bars&Pipes and stormwizard 

Mainly all.res is

amigalibs.res+stormwizard.res+bars&pipes.res+addtional macros need for
reentrant code in AB2 in all.bb2

Hello Blitzers,
               The AmiDiction bug has been fixed so please disregard
my previous e-mail. Version 2.0 should available on the aminet
shortly. Should anyone be so impatient to want it now I could e-mail
it to them personaly or to this blitz list perhaps. :)

im just curious,

how many mail adresses is sent to?

how many different people have posted something
within the last year?

did more people join after AB2?

since the start of the mailing list,
how many emails have been posted each year?


if there is no statistics of this,
you don't need to bother about my curiosity. :)

Hi Bernd,

> Can you please send me the blitzPC Bench.

OK. I was using the Blitz2D compiler version 1.68 (I got it from a magazine and so am not 
able to get updates). I used the most recent code you sent (the one I asked for PB), 
modified it for BlitzPC and increased the "If i2>xxx" line to 90000000. (Is there really 
supposed to be two lines which check i2?)

Anyway, the final exe size was 616kb and the time between the runtime window appearing and 
disappearing was 3 seconds (manually timed).

I tried it again with PB, increasing the loop count to the same as the BlitzPC test 
(90000000) and the program runs in 3 seconds (time from console window opening to closing, 
timed manually). I was timing it incorrectly before.

AmiBlitz2 on my machine takes 4 seconds for the same code (although it only had 9000000 
loops - 10 times less than the PB and BPC code). However, my computer is not very fast for 
emulation.

According to the docs, the default type is integer for BlitzPC.

The original bench use timer and every i2 >1000 it call the timer.
So its simular to this 
But reducing if thens give more advantage for winuae and Amithlon
esspecially in float.

I testet all mit 90 Million Loops

My system is a P3 1 GHZ 100 MHZ FSB 

My PureBasicDemo take for this 23 sec so switching debugger of should give
7* more Speed ?
winuae take 10 sec. 
Your system should take the same time or winuae is not
configured correct.Have you JIT direct Mode set ?.
wbscreen same resolution as AB2 Screen so directx does not close and reopen
the screen ?.Or try sound off but emulatet 

AMithlon take on my System 6 sec (5,5 sec stopped) so i say BlitzPC is
2*faster 
earlier

David it seem you know purebasic.Is it possible to make a standard 
windows dll out of Basic Code ?.Or are there Limits ?


Also you can do the bench in float in PureBasic to see if in praxis a dll is
usefull

integer is not usefull in Praxis 

Thats the new version with command regload.Dont forget set in your Code i2
to long !

It take 15 sec on winuae with regload and 19 sec on winuae with old
compiler.
26% Speed increase.

If someone like to verify let me know i can send the newest AB2.27

A JIT is nothing else as a crossassembler on realtime.So 10*
slower with winuae is near impossible when using Bernies JIT.

It took 3 seconds here. I can check it again with the timer commands from the 3rd party library.

JIT should be on, but I cannot remember what settings I have for it. I think sound is also turned 
on (which I forgot about).

I cannot remember, it is not something I have ever tried. I know that it is as simple as writing a 
function and doing something like:

Declare DLLFunc my_function

I think there is also a compiler switch required. There are also some pre-defined function names 
which you can use on opening the dll with a thread or process and closing it.

I do not know if there are limits about what code you can put in your functions.

OK. I'll send you the results later.

Yes, but I meant that my CPU isn't as good for emulation as a real P3/Athlon (since Durons have 
smaller caches).

I have not given up on AB2, but I do not have time to do as much as I used to (with 
anything related to the Amiga). I have not written any Blitz code for some months, and do 
not get the chance to test all your AB2 updates (sorry) as much as I would like.

If anyone would like to help with the site, it would be appreciated.

I tested the code in Purebasic and I got 3.57 seconds with the debugger disabled and 28.07 seconds 
with the debugger enabled.

In WinUAE I get 20.34 seconds with AB2.26 and 18.82 seconds with AB2.27b1. However, I always got 
compiler errors (Type not found) for the Regload command - is there a later version of AB2.27?

 Actually I used floating point variables in the test with BlitzPC.

 BlitzPC has only two kinds of vars: integer (32bit) and floating-point (32
bit) and the default is integer. In my test, I did use floating point because
I thought PB and AmiBlitz versions did the same.

PB defaults to longwords. AmiBlitz defaults to quicks (from a CPU point of view, the same as 
a longword).

This doesnt matter i use before a Celeron 450 MHZ with also small cache
My SPeed is doubled when change to P3.Important is L1 Cache and here Duron
is larger as P3 so your CPU should faster than P3 but this small Bench it
doesnt matter.ALso the large Hall Algo Bench does not care about L2 Cache
size

The L2 Cache is only need for bad written PC Programms that maybe calc a
pixel and write it to window.If you do calc in a single loop then do
another loop you need no L2 Cache

I have only add the command in your Version the working version i send
you.You get then 15 sec.So you see with this results your duron is fast as
P3 1 GHZ
  
But now i know that if i need more speed it is a possible way to use
purebasic and build a dll.Now i can then calculate 40 reverbs instead of
only 10.But for now 2 seem enough

When i add the 68k FPU stuff in AB2 its just the same work than doiing it
for another CPU.

Go to comment mode ; and type fpu in right search string of the AB2 Source
You get all places i change for 68k FPU.Here you can add then a branch to
ppcfpu and add the opcodes of the PPC.

For integer you need to do like i do.debug AB2 und change the places where
to put code

So you can support another CPU in 1000-1500 ASM Lines or so.

But most important is you need lots of tester who try out code if their
programs
THe AB2 optimizer 1/2 have same problem.The optimizer is 7-8 times faster
much more than a native PPC port will be also PPC have not the byteswap
problem
Only since Thilo with his big program is like to use the optimizer i am able
to make it more stable because compilers allow some Millards formular and i
can not test all.Only many diffrent coding styles from many diffrent people
allow to say that a compiler is stable one fine day

So only 10 Months after AB2 born there is progress of the AB2 optimizers

You see results from David and me 
The mainreason for this is byteswapping 

Every integer read take X86 2 Instruction on integer.5 on float

BTW: Best is when you wait if PPC now in the 6. Year maybe get some User
     instead of loosing User every month 
 
I waste over 1 Year to try port my apps to PPC and so i really done with
PPC.
even that i see that the Powerup/warpup crap now since 6 Years is actuell
and new stuff get delayed aaaaand delayed

The only limitation I`ve had when writing windows dlls in PB are
1: The Nasm assembler always adds an underscore to the beginning of    the 
procedure name (But that`s easily fixed using a hex editor after 
compilation)

Getting back to AmiBlitz, how easy is it to write an Amiga shared library in 
Blitz?
Anyone got a bare bones example I could look at?

 Yes, it's possible (but not in the demo version). There is a DLL example
in the example archive. BTW, can I suggest you BCX ? It's a free powerful
Basic<->C converter which then compiles using Lcc-Win32 (a good free C
compiler). I write my DLLs with BCX and C and they work very fine.

I download it look interesting but learning it take lots time i think.

In the guide the jfe editor show buttons for run build.bat and run

I see this not when i start it

Is it possible that you send me some config files (and where to put them)to

Oggetto: Re: BlitzPC


Your email at bottom.
That's very nice to hear, really. Now I understand you fully.
I'm really sorry not to help you in AB2, but I haven't got time to do
anything now.
I have much to do not related to Amiga or computers in general, and i've got
also personal problems.
Look at this answer for example. Only today i've got time to reply.
I think what you are doing is great, but damn i got no time to see your
work! And i really want to.

If I've understood well, you said that AB2 works great with emulators. I've
done so much Blitz progs, but they doesn't work on any emulator, or they
works partially. So maybe compile them with AB2 will solve the problem?

So what i think is that you're right. PPC users doesn't really needs a
PPC-AB2, because they will run nicely AmigaOS4 on their PPC Amigas, or
MorphOS, so AB2 will work ok. But now, the best way to have an Amiga, is an
emulated one. You can spend 2x the price for a new pc, and you will get only
a slow Amiga, with some serious lacks (I have ADSL now, but how to run well
on an Amiga w/o spending lots of money for hardware and software?). Now you
can have all the features of a pc (i know that most of us will not like it,
but with a pc you can have anything to work, also if it will work bad :),
and have an Amiga that supports all of this with the speed of light, a speed
that cannot be reached even with the most powerful/expensive expansions on a
real Amiga.
Actually the price for a good Amiga is far more than the price for a "good"
pc that will run Amiga faster and, more important, productively.
The question is: what do I need a computer for? Will this computer fulfill
all my needs, in the right way? And how about my future needs? When you'll
know the answers, you'll know what kind of computer you'll need.
Actually i'm using a p200 to read/write emails, surf the web, to play (old)
games, to burn cd's, hear to mp3's, viewing videos, and so on...all of this
at about 100/150 EUR (with no burner), can you say the same for Amiga? My
A1200 + hd + cdrom + 68040/40 +32Mb ram is far more expensive and you really
can't do the same as my pc, or you can do it but slowly and worse. Money
will not grow on trees, and apart from the fact that Amiga is my best
machine, I really can't spend 2 months of pay for a "new" Amiga that will
not run or do what i need. But i can spend 1 month of pay for a new pc, that
will run ALL and the faster Amiga ever seen.

So now i'm keeping my old Amiga only to run software and games with best
compatibility, but i will buy a new pc to run my new Amiga, until the new
one (AmigaONE) will be a reality in all senses.

No this not help i think there are bugs in chipset emulation.But try with
the newest winuae0.8.22 today is release.If you make examples that fail
(maybe with Source)send it to me(others are not familiar with BB2 COde) 
i look on it and explain Toni/bernd the problem more
Toni/Bernd Schmidt the Chipset expert are able to fix the chipsetemu in uae 


On UAE is still the same problem as with AB2 to few bugreports.Toni still
motivate guys to send him legal Progs/Demos that work on a real A500/A1200
but fail on winuae

@NODE "mail_39" " BSD functions "
From: Lorence Lombardo <lombi@...>
Date: 09-12-02 17:51:26
Subject: @{b}BSD functions@{ub}

Hello Blitzers,
               Attached to this e-mail are some BSD functions which I
used in previous versions of BabelDoc and AmiDiction, instead of the
TCP: device. One the annoying things with this set of functions was that
they lacked an EOF function. My asm talents are not very good, so I
was wondering if it would be easy for someone to add an EOF function
to this set of functions. Another problem is that the CloseTCP{}
function is supposed to free the bsdsocket.library. However when
trying to quit the TCP/IP stack I couldnt since the library had not
been freed by the CloseTCP{} function. I also had a complaint that my direct BSD versions of my programs would use much more CPU than the TCP: device versions. I have no idea of this since i only use Amithlon or
sometimes WinUAE these days and my classic Amiga is no longer set up.
The complaint came from someone owning an a1200 with an 040 25mghz.
I was wondering why these functions would use so much CPU when compared
to the TCP: device ?

I have successfully used

I use these commands to make a savefile,

 It either crashes or ignores my supplied

If someone have an example of
how to use these commands in a good way,
I will appreciate it if you posted the example.

If you use the new writetype readtype commands of AB2.27b1 things are easier
and faster you can write whole new types to disk with strings and vars.

Also it is possible to add other vars to this newtypes and load it correct.
Of course additional vars are set to 0   

A example is add in the AB2.27b1 archive.(writetype.ab2 in the examples dir)

This version seem stable but i wait for release to get the optimizer Modes
1/2 hopefully perfect working and release AB2 2.27 on 1 Year birthday (6
November)

I loaded it,
and discovered that the
Writetype and Readtype lines were not tokenized,
thus were not recognized as commands.

so I tried to update deflibs,
but that didn't help.

is there a lib somewhere for it?

already? ;)


btw,
I need to save large Arrays
into a savefile for 2Dstrategy.
Will that work with the new commands?

You need to put the libs in ab2.27b1 decompiled dir to your decompiled dir
start librarymaster and do a createacidlibs 

Now it should tokenize and work

You can also store with writetype simple type vars (type .l .b .w .f).Only
limit is
stringvars
For whole arrays (you mean dim ar.l(20,20) ?)i found doing like this a good
solution

Dim test.l(10,20)
WriteMem 0,&test,10*20*4

BUT.A old bb2 Bug do not give the address of the dim correct.

a.l=20
writetype 0,&a,4 work correct so it seem that you cannot get a address
of a dim.Bad if you want acsess the dim throug asm

I fix this soon 

I also have near ready a replace of the arrayacsesscode.Originally it is
very slow and increase programsize lots.

Are there some Users out who have in their programs lots of array accsess ?
So i can send you a version to test your Code
 
Standard Blitz array acsess 

MOVE    #0,D1         
MOVE.L  D0,-(A7)        
MOVE    D1,D0

Subject: @{b}Font Sensitive GadTools (Again)@{ub}

I'm trying to get a column of figures (Dollar values) neatly aligned on the 
decimal point using a proportional font.    These figures can take any 
value from $0.00 up to $99,999.99

At the moment I'm using Text-type Gadtools gadgets but the figures do 
not align because bbbbb$1.00 is a lot less wide than $10,000.00 (b is 
supposed to represent leading spaces.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can make this happen 
(on OS3.5 if that makes a difference)

I think the "Format" command should do the job for you. 
Here is an example :-

Format "###.00"
NPrint 23.5
NPrint 10
NPrint .5
MouseWait

It will work the same weather you have OS3.5 or not.

If the "Format" command does not work for you. You could try a bit of
math using the "Len" command. Assuming all your figures have 2
decimal places after the point. You could have a variable with a set
string length value. 
eg.
str_len = 15
pad_space = str_len - Len(figure_string$)

etc....
pad_space will give a value of the number of spaces required to pad
the figure_string$

Hmmm, format won't work, it needs a non-proportional font :(

Ok, try something like this...

dmax=100 ;max width of dollar area

temp$=str$(number):slen=peek.l(&temp$-4)
temp2$=left$(temp$,slen-2) ;dollars + "."
temp3$=right(temp$,2)      ;cents
 
dwidth=dmax-textlength_(rp,temp2$,peek.l(&temp2$-4))
move_ rp,x+dwidth,y : text_ rp,temp2$,slen-2
move_ rp,x+dmax  ,y : text_ rp,temp3$,2

Thanks for all the help on this one.

Unfortunately, I didn't describe the problem very well.

I can decimal-point align when writing to the bitmap myself.   The 
problem occurs when I am trying to use a text-type GadTools gadget.   
These always (afaik) left-align the string inside the gadget.   I have 
been able to build the string with an appropriate number of spaces, but 
spaces are too narrow.   

I think Lawrence's suggestion will be the way to go - calculate the 
number of spaces required to pad out the string to the required length 
rather than simply replacing leading zeroes with spaces.

Unless someone knows of a GT Flag to realign the string in a text 
gadget.

I'll post something when I've got it working

Thanks again for all the advice.

I just re-read your problem. You 1st say your usinig a proportional
font. However you then go to say that 2 strings of equal character
length are of different pixel length.
ie. bbbbb$1.00 & $10,000.00  =  10 characters
Therefore the font you are using cannot be proportional.
Topaz 8 is actually 8x8 and is proportional. Try topaz 8 for an
experiment in your program and see what happens. Then try look for
another proportianl font to your liking. If you dont use a poportional
your calculations need to be made in terms of pixels rather than
characters.

Hmmm, I think your having a bit of a mis-understanding here...

Topaz etc. are not proportional fonts, they are fixed width, eg. an 'I' and 
a 'M' both take up the same screen space.
In the case of non fixed width fonts the screen width of a character is
proportional to the character...

Yes OK "fixed width font" is the term I should'v used and yes a
confusion of terminology on my part, however the content is correct
nevertheless. :)  Thank you for pointing that out to me I think I've had my terminology arse about in that area for a while. :)
String command calculations cannot possibly work if not using a fixed width font. How would you calculate word wraping if you were to use a non fixed width font ?

lol, I've just been working on that...

basically from an ascii text file I grab a line of text to display, check
the length
in pixels to see if the whole line can be displayed, if not go back to the
previous space and check again etc. When it will fit I put it on screen,
check the rest of the
line, if smaller I check for 2 returns (paragraph). If found display the
line else append
the next line and start again...

But in order to do that you'd have to know the pixel width of each
individual character to do so ? Or is ther some sort of OS function to do that ? Not only that but that wrapped text is only useful for that specific screen mode and font.

In HTMLstrip I set the default wrapping to 76 characters in length
which is quite a common standard for Amiga and PC. Texts can be viewed
on a 640 wide screen using an 8x8 font (80 characters wide max). Those
texts also print nicely with a simple "type text.doc >PRT:" or LPT1: on a standard A4 printer in generic mode. :)

use result.l=TextLength_(rp,string,stringlen)

result will be length of the text in pixels...

I'm sure you can right and centre align text in gadgets, but not all of them.

#STRINGA_Justification, #STRINGRIGHT are the tags you need for integer and string 
gadgets (0s2.04+). #GTNM_Justification,#GTJ_RIGHT for number gadgets (0s3.0+) and 
#GTTX_Justification,#GTJ_RIGHT for text gadgets (0s3.0+).

However, if you use a variable width font, the decimal points will still not line up 
correctly for values such as xx.88 and xx.11.

You can set in ped prefs label size to any size you wish.If you set to 0 the
right window is off.

Later i plan window presets on F Key so you can switch between fullscreen

Hello all!

Question:

I have a program that want to execute some code that is
NOT present in the main exe. The code is loaded on runtime
from an external file. The code should provide a function index
at the beginning. (like a library)
An amiga shared library would do this, but the libraries have
some overhead and properies I dont want.
(like only open one instance)

The code should just look like this:

;_________________ begin 
move.l #-1,d0 ; just in case someone executes this
RTS

BRA my_function1
BRA my_function2
...
BRA my_functionx

my_function1:
... do some nasty stuff here

__________________ end

Maybe loadseg does it, I have no clue.
Once I just created an exe fiel and loaded it into memory
and branched to the desired address, but
my code crashed immediately.

Any suggestions ?

Why is there overhead? From the example of what the code should look like, you 
look to have done the same as a shared lib anyway, so it would have the same 
overhead.

Why is there a problem with only having one instance in memory? IIRC Bernd fixed 
the AB2 code so that you can use basic commands in a library. If it is not that, 
you could always use an allc and free function to create any instance specific 
storage (e.g. like with the asl.library). Or is it something else?

I found the Hunk guide on Aminet to be quite good for explaining things like exe 
format and even how to write your own loadseg routine. It might be worth a look 
(although ISTR the Guru book having more information if you have that lying 
around).

Sorry, forgot to mention - you probably need blitzlibs:amigalibs.res or 
blitzlibs:all.res in the Compiler Options->Residents box.

No, more likely to be because I am too lazy to have tested the code I sent, hence the

Suddenly I have the problem I can`t open more than 4 extra windows, besides the ones 
which are already open by default. I`m using OS functions to open windows. What 
happens is I see a quick flash of the window and also a quick flash of my requester 
stating the openwindowtaglist failed, but so quick its about 1/50 of a second or so. 
There`s some clash, but I`ll be damned if I know what. By the way, increasing objects 
in the compiler options ofcourse has no effect.

A trace through the source does reveal that openwindowtaglist returns zero and 
thus fails. I wonder if this is a known problem, I faintly recall having this before, 
but can`t remember more right now.

A have long time ago with C the same problem.Every window use a own signal
bit.
The limit is 10 Windows maximum.If you want more you need a shared IDCMP for

I knew it wasn`t a bug or so. How do I share IDCMP bits. I`ll be checking the rkrm

You need create a port by hand all other is simular like using the
blitzmsgport command 

If you make a new porgram you can open a window with 0 IDCMP flags and put
the blitzmessageport to it

disable_
*winaddr\UserPort=blitzmsgport
*winaddr\IDCMPFlags=myflags
enable_

Now you can use blitzmessage commands like waitevent ....

To disable it do a
disable_
*winaddr\IDCMPFlags=0
flushevents
*winaddr\UserPort=0
enable_

Why? I think it`s fun to know what`s going on and to be able to do that yourself. 
It`s quite a learning experience and when you know it it becomes easy, I also learned 
c quite a bit just by browsing rkrm et al. Converted a bunch of rkrm c examples for 
example(even sent some to the list).

From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>

Subject: @{b}OT - Sorry - but this print problem is driving me nuts@{ub}

Hi there,

Sorry for this off topic post, but I'm at my wits end.

I've recently installed a Micronik Z2 busboard and CV64/3D running CGX 4.2 R5.
Before this, everything was running sweet as nut, if a little pixelated and
slow.

However, I've hit some printing problems that, despite my best efforts, I can't
cure.

When printing from either Wordworth or Drawstudio, using TurboPrint 7.20 (the
same with 7.16) I get a printout that /looks/ smeared. It seems that some lines
are printed correctly, and some are offset (considerably) and stretched. The
printer is fine, and prints from PageStream, Multiview and GraphicsPublisher
fine (as well as being OK with a simple "Echo >PRT: Hello" test).

After several configuration changes to Printer and TurboPrint prefs, I
eventually uninstalled TP and tried with the WB drivers instead. Now Wordworth
prints - nothing at all. WW goes through the motions, and the printer jumps
into life and loads the paper, with it's little light flashing away, but
nothing gets put back on the page.

To make matters worse, sometimes I get a proper printout, but trying to do it 3
times in a row is no go.

Given the problem with t WB drivers as well, I'm assuming this is either a
memory problem, or a bitmap problem, but nothing seems to fix it. I've tried
original and MuLib libraries, disabling all patches/hacks etc. but am nowhere
nearer.

If *anyone* knows what the hell is going on, please let me in on it. I've spent
4 weeks trying to fix this, and I'm going through ink and paper at a rate of
knots.

Before anyone suggests re-installing TP/Wordworth/Drawstudio - don't bother.
Been there, done that, same result.

If I wasn't bald already, I'd be tearing my hair out in clumps :o(

First one to give me the solution gets my prayers for a lottery win for the next
month :o) 

All the best

Have you tried different printer drivers?
I`ve found the Peter Hutchinson ones on Aminet pretty good.

Also, have you tried running Snoopdos to see if there are any missing files 
trying to be loaded?

One last thought just entered my vacant mind.. since it only started 
happening after installing Cgfx, it could be a 24bit picture datatype 
problem ??

I haven`t forgotten the Nlist hook example I promised either..I should 
finally get my 4000 running again this week after regaining enough desk

Yep - I've tried a variety of compatible printer drivers (including Peter
Hutcinsons 610C driver) - all with the same result.
 
DH> Also, have you tried running Snoopdos to see if there are any missing files

Yep - the only file I could identify was oldprinter.device trying to be loaded
by TP at startup. I tried copying the orginal printer.device renamined as
oldprinter.device, and deleting ALL TP files (including he TP printer.device) -
re-installing the original printer.device and then re-installing TP - np
difference.

The reasons why I dont wanted to use libraries:
(some of them now I know better)

- libraries stay in memory after usage (?)
- libraries have to be in a special path (?)
- libraries have a bit more code than the plain instructions
- libraries can have only one instance
(which make them a bit more complicated to program
if you need several instances)
- libraries need the ending .library (?)
- libraries are a bit more difficult (wasnt easy to do this in blitz)
- libraries are visible to the system

But I think I will use libraries now.
Main advantage is that it is a standard interface.

Thanks for your help.

Yes, they can do that. However, if you write the CloseLibrary function to call 
your expunge function when the library opencount is 0, your library will remove 
itself.

> - libraries have to be in a special path (?)

No - I think you should be able to put them in any path, but you just need to 
write the full path in the OpenLibrary_() call from your application. In fact, the 
exec.library/OpenLibrary autodoc specifically mentions you can do that :)

> - libraries have a bit more code than the plain instructions

Yes.

> - libraries can have only one instance
> (which make them a bit more complicated to program

Yes.

> - libraries need the ending .library (?)

No, but you need to make sure the name string which is embedded in the library 
file is the same as the filename.

> - libraries are a bit more difficult (wasnt easy to do this in blitz)

Yes - but at least you can write some in basic code rather than 100% assembly 
language. Also, if you ever did open this up to external developers, or change 
language or whatever, the plugins (I guess that's what they are?) would be in a 
standard format that is easier to work with.

> - libraries are visible to the system

Yes - but only if you provide an .FD file or some autodocs or something. If you do 
not do that, people would need to disassemble your library to figure out what it 
does ;)

I told that you can simulate with this the enforcerhit some system get so
you can check if your prog maybe fail due this
But dont add this line to your code 


I also test how to save a array to file

This Code work correct

Dim test.l(10,10)

Hello,


Sorry for this simples questions from a beginner of amiblitz but sometime
there is questions like that ;-)



1.

 With AB 2.26, I open the preferences and checked is: use WB pal and clone
WB. I uncheck clone WB and open the screenmode requester and choose
800x600x16 bit PC Voodoo mode. AB 2.26 is here normally.


I use the preference window again but there is no gadget in the center for
choosing the 4 color available. If I use the use button again, my amiga
freeze and there is a guru like that:

Error : 80000003 (DEADEND)
By    : System: no alert occured
Cause : Illegal address access (ie: odd)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is when I choose the screenmode and It's the same screenmode as
just before.


2.

With amiblitz 2.26, if I use the deflibs window and scroll down all the ;
untill the end, the vertical scroll continue after the end of the last ; 



3.

A general question about making a GUI. I'm wanted to know the best GUI for
making a gadtools GUI and also If It's possible with Amiblitz to use a Gui
maker for MUI and add the code in amiblitz, the same with other kind of GUI
if It's possible.

It ispossible to use an MUI builder for Blitz, but you have to do a fair amount
of cleaning up afterwards. Also, the builders use MUI directly meaning that the
advantages of using the EFMUILib commands (and in some cases there are
advantages) are lost.

After a lot of work with MUI in Blitz, I've found the best approach is to do it
by hand. That way, you have more control, and in the long run, it tends to be
faster.

As an aside - be VERY careful when using MUI. Keep a close watch especially on
MUI object numbers, and make sure that you don't duplicate them. The debugger
won't catch th errors, and you'll crash - a lot. I find the best approach is to
assign a group of object numbers to each section of the GUI (enough so that
you'll have spare), and add a comment at the start of each section listing the
object numbers already used.

Regards

You can use GadToolsBox (from aminet) to create gadtools gui's then you need
something like BlitzGUIGen or GUI2BB2 which convert the gadtoolsbox save file
into blitz code, but unless your doing a complex gui, it's easier to code it 
by hand.

I tend to us gadtoolsbox as a 'drawing program' to mess about with different
layouts before deciding on the final one. 

Of the two converters (that I know about) BlitzGUIGen is the better one, but
is crippleware, limited without a keyfile, I don't know if you can still register
or not (the progam is 5 years old now, but then GUI2BB2 is 7 years)...

The easiest way to make a gui fontsensitve use modern stuff pages hierachy
is using stormwizard.It is a editor which let you load/save groups as
templates which create a binary so you can show with wzwindow the whole
window.It is possible to change the gui without recompile the program or
embed the binary in a AB2 Program 
YOu can add amiga standard Boopsi gadgets.Also you can acsess full gadget
structure (wzgadaddr)to do nearly all with it.   

Reading/writing to gadgets is easy as you write shell programs.
Only diffrence for locate you give a gadgat name so its then wzprint
"striggad1",a$ instead locate 10,10:print a$

The ab2 implementation knows automatic if you want set a slider val or
stringval tabval you need no stupild tags or something of course if you
want something special (using diffrent colors in Listviews) you can set
special tags with wztags before command.

Look for examples zinzeszins.ab2 and wizard.ab2 (AB2.27 have a enhanced
one)in Distri examples dir 
A standard wizard messageloop template for new program you can add per
mouseclick out of the wizardguidehelp

Disadvantages: not so nice as MUI not so much classes

2.2 does cost something (10$+shipping) i get it not for realase as i hope

I think the stormwizard editor 1.0 is available on a magazin CD

this is excellent!

I tried it,
and it doesn't crash or anything if it tries
to read variables that are not written yet.
that is very good!

now I can save anything very easy
using only arrays,
as im not experienced with newtypes.

You need to save before the write your dimsize if you use variable dims
for example 

a.l=10*10*4               ;the actual dimsize this file have

writemem 0,&a,4           ;save the size of it
writemem 0,&dim(0,0),a


To read it
use this:
readmem 0,&a,4            ;this get the size of the dim from this file
readmem 0,&dim(0,0),a

This make sure that you not read to much data

But to get no trouble it is only allowed to increase the last dimension
All other dimensions must be the same.The limit is the same as the dim keep
addon
see example dimkeep.ab2 for more

Subject: @{b}sound masking.@{ub}


I don't know how to code in C or assembler myself,
so I post this suggestion to any who can.


PROBLEM: 
a compiled executable
wich has any sound command
 ie:
 Sound
 Freq
 Period
stops any other sounds that are playing
in any of the 4 channels,
when it is started, or quit.

Forexample, you have 1 Sound
in your program, wich is initiated very rarely,
and you are running a music playing program
like Eagleplayer.
 When you run your program,
it will stop any sound from Eagleplayer,
and possibly crashing it, or your miggy. 


SUGGESTION:
change it so that a program
with a sound command in it,
will NOT stop ANY other sound
playing on either of the 4 channels.

additionally,
sounds could be stopped
ONLY when entering Blitz mode.

Amithlon on my System get here 7.2 with patch3
I found out that using patch 4 reduce speed on my system with 

fmove.s fp0,r@(a5)

Note r must used before this with maybe r=0 or you get Type not found
 
from 37 Mips to 14 Mips using only this instruction in bench loop

BTW: Davids Duron 750 seem faster than my P3

Hm the bad results of PB and Blitz PC seem that peek and poke are really
slow on them.

Maybe there is another way on PB or BlitzPC to read/write data ?
Using a dll from Purebasic in uae or maybe Amithlon to get maximum Speed
is a handy way but seem not make sense if peek and poke is so slow 


Reading and writing data is important for apps that are too slow.
Video/imageprocessing/audioprocessing all need reading datas fast as
possible

I just noticed that I had made a mistake when I re-wrote your benchmark code for PB and 
BlitzPC. I had used a line like "If GetTickCount()_>500" instead of "If 
GetTickCount()_>1000" when it displayed the results. For some reason I forgot that ticks 
on the Amiga were 50ths and multiplied the number to compare against by 10 instead of 20. 
Sorry. The correct results are:

PB:
13.0 million loops / second (without debugger)
2.7 million loops / second (with debugger)

BlitzPC:
4.2 million loops / second (without debugger)
0.03 million loops / second (with debugger)

Sorry about those incorrect numbers I sent earlier :(

> Maybe there is another way on PB or BlitzPC to read/write data ?

There is another way, which also works under AB2 (this allows you to treat the pointer as 
a pointer to an array of any size):

NEWTYPE.fptr
  f.f[0]
End NEWTYPE
*buf.fptr = AllocMem(...)
*buf\f[0] = r

; same as
Poke.f *buf,r

This got around 12.3 million loops / second. If I changed the code with the Poke/Peek to 
access a different item in memory each time ("PokeF(buf+4, r)") then it also got 12.3 
million loops / second.

If I change the code so that it uses a newtype which is just a pointer to a single float 
(and therefore not using an array any more - "*buf\f = r") the PB code gets 15.0 million 
loops / second.

So it does seem that Poke/Peek are slower for simple pokes and peeks which always come 
from the same memory address, but they are the same speed when you are treating memory as 
an array.

Here come my old Speedfactor again 2*slower.So its possible to use PB as lib
builder if speed really is too slow

Thats still in winuae:

It use no windows func.The dll is processed manually so it can work on
AMithlon too

From: Joar Berntsen <joar.berntsen@...>
Date: 09-24-02 16:21:49
Subject: @{b}tip on easy speedup if needed.@{ub}


If you are making realtime, or any other program genre that
needs to maintain speed, then I have Just recently
discovered how to kill slowdowns when processing
multiple If commands. (especially arrays using them)
here is multiple if endif code.:

if A=1
 if B=1
  if C=1
  D=1
  endif
 endif
endif

now, lets say that A nearly always equals 1.
That means program flow will always go into A's if-endif
and always use cpu cycles doing it.

and B is also very frequently 1, so it also eats cycles

but C however nearly ever is 1.

so why should program flow need to use cycles on
things that nearly never needs it?...

we don't want that ofcourse,
so I suggest this alteration:

if C=1
 if A=1
  if B=1
  D=1
  endif
 endif
endif

now, this code will nearly always be skipped
when program flow reaches >if C=1
thus, cpu cycles are saved, and your prog is faster.
 Since B is less probabal to equal 1,
we could also swap B and A in the above example
for even more speed. 

summary:
use those if's with LEAST probability
first in multiple if structures.


I first used this method this on an array
of about 300 quicks,
and the speed increase was substantial!

I am aware that some multiple if-endif
structures needs to be as they were made,
but my tip is aimed towards those structures
that CAN be altered.


probably many of you, and myself, use the
 If (x=1 AND y=1) OR z=1...etc
but that is not a good idea if you need
to maintain speed, because all variables
will be checked and compared (if im correct)
and it could infact be slower than my first ABCD example.


Im glad to (try to) help ya'll for a change. ;)

When I spawn 2 child processes using createnewproc_, which both have access to the 
global variable base, I get an "unable to free memory" error in the debugger when I 
dim an array which has already been "dimmed". For example in the main loop I do "dim

the same array multiple times before the loop, but after the creation of the 
processes, or before the loop and before the creation of the processes no error 
occurs. Also I can just hit run in the debugger and it continues fine, until it 
encounters the dim again and an executable without debugging also works fine.

I recall such an error from earlier times, but afaik it was fixed.

On a related note, what do I need to use again, memlib.obj or memlibpool.obj? Is the 
latter outdated?

That happen because BB2 work like this.The main program creates a list where
all global mem entries are in.If you call a subfunction another list is
create.If something went wrong and the memalloc is not found in the list
you get this error
with mempool.obj.The original memlib.obj give you no error but result in
random crashes wrong freed mem...

Using subtask is critical on all Systems/languages you need semaphores for
global data.Use if you share data lockbasic unlockbasic also if you use
builtin gui windows etc on subtasks.

Only which is safe to use is if you are in functions and use your local
vars.
On C its the same you nee for all global vars (c use a4 or absolute adress
for this)so you need a lock because every time a program can change your
global var  

If this still not help make a small example so i see what went wrong

Ok, so it`s best to use memlibpool.obj then.

Currently the child processes aren`t using any gui elements, neither creating their 
own. But they do share lots of data, dynamic arrays of possibly big sizes(dynamic 
after all =) . So what I should do is whenever the child process uses these(it only 
reads them) is put the specific code in between a lock- and unlockbasic "block"?

The dim array command where this error actually occurs can be any array, it doesn`t 
need to be used by any child process at all. In fact I first noticed it at "dimming" 
a taglist array(I always use the same name and redim it to the rquired size).

And dont forget this use in both tasks

You can do it too in the OS way with a semaphore if you like to see whats
done or a more specific lock.lockbasic use intern a sempahore that is
global to the whole Program (done in init)

Also Read the AmigaOS manual for semaphore and safe subtask data share

BTW: taglist arrays are not necessary since AB2 there is a easier way with
less chars (simular to C behavior)

You can use the tags command and can split taglines with @@ for better
overview.
Also it is possible to outcomment a line for testing easy 

Thats a snipe of code from the image_include using the guigfx Call
createpicturemaska

Note: this use a global space so a lockbasic /unlockbasic is need if you use
it from more tasks

 If CreatePictureMaskA_(\pic_ptr,\mask_ptr,width,Tags(@@
          #GGFX_Ratio,2,@@
          #TAG_DONE,0))=0
          error {"Cannot create Mask !"}

I`ve been using the taglist array method so often in this code it`ll be hard to 
change it all. Also I didn`t really get the "@@" thing working in the past. What is 
this \pic_ptr etc, shouldn`t there be sth before the \?

Ah yes, I`ve been trying out that code, but I have made changes and bugfixes to it, 
as in supplying screen and window pointers in the function call instead of this used 
window and peek.l addr screen stuff and the odd little bug. I`ll release that when 
it`s done.

I`d like to add that it`s kinda odd it happens once, then hitting run in
debugger makes it run as normal and it won`t happen again. Though contraryto
what I said earlier, a binary without debug will crash at that.

Also here is some code which shows a bit what I do to create a process.
Although the way I message them is much different ofcourse, I use exec
messaging for that ofcourse, this is just a quick example. Note that this code
does NOT give any errors.

teller.l=0
badmethod.b=NFalse
pr1done.b=NFalse
pr2done.b=NFalse

pr1name$="Pr1"
pr2name$="Pr2"

MOVE.l a5,globbase ;reserve global variable base for process
MOVE.l a5,globbase2

Dim tag.TagItem(3)
  tag(0)\ti_Tag=#NP_Entry, ?pr1
  tag(1)\ti_Tag=#NP_Name, &pr1name$
  tag(2)\ti_Tag=#NP_Priority, 0
*proces.l=CreateNewProc_(tag(0))

Dim tag.TagItem(3)
  tag(0)\ti_Tag=#NP_Entry, ?pr2
  tag(1)\ti_Tag=#NP_Name, &pr2name$
  tag(2)\ti_Tag=#NP_Priority, 0
*proces.l=CreateNewProc_(tag(0))

Repeat
  Dim bbbb.l(10)
  teller=teller+1
Until teller=1000
badmethod=NTrue
Repeat
  Delay_(1)
Until pr1done=NTrue AND pr2done=NTrue

Delay_(50)

End

.pr1
  MOVEM.l a0-a6/d0-d7,-(a7) ;save registers
  MOVE.l globbase(pc),a5 ;global variable base

  Repeat
    Delay_(1)
    a.l=1+1
  Until badmethod=NTrue

  pr1done=NTrue

  MOVEM.l (a7)+,a0-a6/d0-d7 ;restore registers

No all task that change a global variables need to block.If a subtask do a
lockbasic
then when the maintask want change a var too the maintask is not block.

If you dont do os stuff that maybe do a wait you can also do a
disable/enable or forbid/permit call if you want

Oh i understand this.Same reason that i do not porting AB2 to other CPU
The work to usablity is too low 

Changing something existing if get same result is no good idea.

But adding new code you can choose the tags command(if you wish)and  use
less code.

>Also I didn`t really get the "@@" thing working in

It is enhanced in newer AB2 Version but i think for tags it was still ok
If not send the code which cause problem

> the past. What is this \pic_ptr etc, shouldn`t there be sth before the \?

This is another parameter.The path is set at the beginning of function with
usepath so a \typevar is enough

The tags command do get a adress where all the tags are put.This work
too

tagpointer=tags(#xxxxx,a,#xxxxxx,b)

Or just put it in a function call where a pointer to taglist is requestet as
the 
example do (press help over command to see shorthelp)

maybe do a unlockbasic before you execute the large time function.
In this situation you need take care for locking the code if you use global

If I do it exactly like you say, in this example source or my bigger source I get a 
huge crash, so that can`t be the way. Or maybe this way should only be done at wait 
commands? The main loop has got a delay_(1) and setsignal combination. Mainly because 
all the parameters added to the wait_ or waitport_ command wouldn`t fit on one line.

I`ve narrowed this error down to the fact that the child process does a waitport_ 
after sending a message to the parent, to wait for a replymessage and then do the 
usual. If I remove the waitport, but still do the getmsg_ loop until it returns 0, or

Your Code sent to list i can not run (missing labels vars)

Atached is a Prototype  of a bars&Pipes plugin which contain all necessary
to enhance it easy (simular to a Wizard in VisualC or Borland C).
It work well 
Note that Bars&Pipes create a task for every tool is open.

This mean this code must safe to execute from diffrent tasks at once.
(#maxwindows=3) means 3 Tasks can execute the same code.You can increase as
much you like but dont forget increase maxwin in the compiler options

The window file is test.wizard (same as in the wizard.bb example)

The amigalibs.res is really a mess one have _Screen other have Screen

Is the newest one a Version without _Screen ?
  
Is source here ?

Attached is a running version which work ok here (davids amigalibs.res)
I do the unlock/lock code not correct on the mail

Yes.

I *think* I have it, although it might be the Amiga PureBasic OS resident source I have (they 
should be quite similar). I can look for it, but you would not be able to distribute the 
source.

However, there is a problem in that Fred had to patch the amigalibs.res after he compiled it 
because Blitz would always tokenise the field names inside structures.

My prog opens a window on workbench,

You should not really "steal" the Workbench screens bitmap like this since you do 
not own it, and changing it as you do here may cause problems with the Workbench 
(for example, if it tries to close the screen).

The best thing to do it to draw to a window on the Workbench screen, or use your own 
screen if you need to draw directly to the screen.

For drawing to a window you can use BitMapToWindow (I think), WBlit, the super 
bitmap commands (PositionSuperBitMap, PutSuperBitmap - for drawing parts of a larger 
bitmap to a window) and any OS function which draws to a rastport (since the 
rastport in a window contains all the necessary clipping).

AFAIK all those methods work on AGA and graphics cards.

PS, you will still need to use the FindScreen command to get access to the Workbench 
screen. After that, SMouseX/Y should work. If you are using a Window to draw to the 
screen, it might be easier to use WMouseX/Y (same as SMouseX/Y but relative to the 
window not the screen) and EMouseX/Y (same as WMouseX/Y but gives the mouse position 
at the last event).

thanks,
but I forgot that it wasn't SmouseX/Y
I had problems with,
but the Point command, wich reads a pixels colorregister

Point doesn't read anything when only Findscreen is used

maybe there is a better command than point?

will forexample readpixel_ work with only findscreen?

I copied this to ab2,

I tried:

WColour -1,-1
MenuColour -1
Window ...,-1,-1

none of them made it use the same menu colours.

You need to include amigalibs.res which contains all the OS types(which Screen is) 
etc.

Did you put blitzlibs:amigalibs.res or blitzlibs:all.res in your Compiler Options, Residents box? 
If you did, you might have a different version from me where some of the types have an underscore 
before them. Try using *scr._Screen.

Well, it should (for the Window command) - you should not need to bother with the MenuColour or 
WColour. You might also need to add the "new look menus" flag to the Window command. I think it 
has the value $200000, but you might as well use #IDCMP_NEWLOOKMENUS if you already have the 
resident included.

Also, if you are opening your own screen (instead of just using the WB screen) you will need to 
specify the colours for the screen or they will not use the standard OS colours (I think - I might 
be wrong here).

The easiest way is to use the #SA_LikeWorkbench,-1 tag in a call to ScreenTags. You can then add 
the other tags to make your screen the way you want it but all values that you do not specify will 
be copied from the Workbench.

@NODE "mail_128" " write everything to disk "
From: Joar Berntsen <joar.berntsen@...>
Date: 09-08-02 19:50:32
Subject: @{b}write everything to disk@{ub}


I am making a save/load feature in my strategy game,
and I noticed that I have to save nearly all
variables used,
so I suddenly got a cool idea:



IDEA:
why not have commands
that when initiated,
writes ALL named variables
to one file,
 and can load
all back in.



EXAMPLE:

;these abc are called before the later abc
a=1
b=1
c=1

;the next line will save ALL variables
;in the program
;with its current value

SaveAllProgramVariables <file>

;these abc are called after the above abc
;and after the save of all variables 

a=2
b=2
c=2

;now we load back the program variables

LoadAllProgramVariables <file>

;now the abc variables is 1 again
;because the load overwrote the last abc calls



PROBLEMS:
the developer may delete some
variables from the source,
so that the saved file has variables
that is not used in the program anymore.
 that could be solved
by making the variable at load time.

but there are probably many other problems. 

I just wanted to share my idea,
because it would make game saving features VERY easy.

Hello Joar

Uhh! This could lead to many unexpected sideeffects
if you save really ALL variables. You can not keep
in mind all thousands of variables and what will
happen if you restore them all. This would mean
that your program is kind of memory less after
this command, like you had used a freezer cardridge,
but the difference is that you dont load/save at the
exactly same position in the code. And what
about preferences ? They will all be saved too.

- Na! -

Better idea is that all save-game relevant data
is used in one single newtype, and then just do
a writemem &mynewtype,sizeof.mynewtype.
(if you dont use strings) which is one single command
and very easy too.
I remember that there are some new commands
for stroring a whole newtype including strings.
(correct me if i am wrong). Maybe someone else can
write about this.


Ciao,

Thilo

That is very hard to implement and if your prog groes you maybe get strange
effects random crashes etc.

But a trick still work

AB2 put all vars that declared one after one

For example if you have 
deftype.l a,b,c,d,e,f declared each after each to make sure no unwantet var
is saved

you can save this with a writemem command too 

writemem 0,&f,&a-&f.Note that you need reverse order (last var &f is first
var)because global var grow negative.With local vars you need reverse order

Note strings cannot save with this method
 
This i thought with the writetype command this

Make a newtype

newtype .mysavevars
a.l
b$
c
end newtype

Here you can put all vars you want to save in.

If you have no strings in your newtype you can use writemem its faster.If
you have strings in you need writetype
