                    Blitz List.guide 	 01 Jun 1999                      

               contains Yam mail within the following dates                
             first: 1 May/99/19:11:27   last: 31/May/1999              



--- Here are the ezmlm command addresses.

I can handle administrative requests automatically.
Just send an empty note to any of these addresses:

   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>:
   Receive future messages sent to the mailing list.

   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>:
   Stop receiving messages.

   <blitz-list-get.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>:
   Retrieve a copy of message 12345 from the archive.

DO NOT SEND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUESTS TO THE MAILING LIST!
If you do, I won't see them, and subscribers will yell at you.

To specify God@heaven.af.mil as your subscription address, send mail
to <blitz-list-subscribe-God=heaven.af.mil@netsoc.ucd.ie>.
I'll send a confirmation message to that address; when you receive that
message, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.






                      Encoding: quoted-printable

 This transfer standard introduces strange characters into the final guide
          which may make some individual mail items harder to read.

Hello,

   No it`s not SPAM!!... And you probably think I`ve gone mad?

There has been some,.. Lets say, `argument' (sort of) over which
looks better. My silhuette of a chicken or GazChap.. And so far,
the votes are ever-so-slightly leaning towards the chicken
(VERY BIG EXAGERATION!)

For 1 day only, you have the the chance the watch Gaz Melt and
turn into a Chicken on the SDS site... It`s gotta be worth a look
hasn`t it?... goto http://www.satanicdreams.freeserve.co.uk/
and click on the little members section button (thing that looks
like a newspaper (i`ve been told)) at the top... Then scroll
down and VOTE... 

VOTE Chicken :)

It`s not some ellaborate way to get you to hit our site,......
Well actually it is... ahahahahahah, but it`s gotta be worth
it to see all the above for FREE!.. This sort of material is
priceless :) ahahahahah!

Sorry it`s off topic and stuff but it`s 1 day only, and I want
to prove once and for all that the Chicken looks better, and make
it official :)

Democracy..... Ahhhhhhhhhh... dont ya just love it :)

BTW - It`s just a joke but hey, when was the last time one of them
       floated into the blitz-list...??  And you gorp at Gaz`s ugliness,
       but thats not the point, it`s a poll :)

Hooooray!!

I've found Julian Kinraid's original archive that just has the patch progr=

I've added a script to install it for you (making a backup of acidlibs of

 how 
to test if you have a broken acidlibs.

Okay, I'll have a look. But....

I have 3 different versions of acidlibs (including .old and .xold)
counting the one I'm using. Anybody know which (if any?) is the most
current, bug fixed and therefore best to use judging by the file
sizes??

I have acidlibs with sizes of:

221,072 (current one)

219,020 (old one)

272,572 (from RWE I think?)

What's the size of YOURS!!! (fnaar)

Do the maths yourself! In ASM! Or something! I think there might be a libr=
ary 
on Aminet for 64 bit maths, but I don't know. Try using the search thing.

Adding and subtracting are easy enough, you just need to check for the car=
ry 
flag halfway through your add or subtract. Multiply and divides are either=
 
shifts and adds or shifts and subtracts. Although, you obviously have to w=
atch 
for numbers getting shifted out of the register when multiplying big numbe=
rs.

Or maybe there is an easier way for multiply and divide.

You mnight want to read this from Aminet, its how to do high number of bit=
 
arithmatic on 6811 (8 bit) microprocessor. Its all in 6811 asm but it comm=
ented 
and 6811 asm is real easy.

math68hc11.lzh     dev/cross   12K 304 PD Maths functions for 68HC11. Real=
 
FFT,Floa

Also, search on Altavista. Using 'where can I get algorithms for performin=
g 64 
bit integer calculations?' I got some interesting pages

http://www.mactech.com/articles/develop/issue_26/semchishen.html
http://www.mot-sps.com/csic/techdata/appnote/an1219r1.pdf (similar to 6811=
 
stuff above)

You can do that with words, if you just treat each 16 bit number as a sing=
le 
digit in a decimal calculation.

Its a bit more confusing, and trickier to print out, but it is the same 
principle and you gain speed.

Yes, it's a compromise between speed and memory usage.

If you're not worried about speed/efficiency...

Why not use BCD (Binary coded decimal) - use an array of bytes to hold
the individual digits.  You can even use a list if you want to be flash
so that you have dynamic numbers up to infinite (well almost) length.
Arithmetic can be carried out like decimal.

Hi,
   I got it! YES! My miggy is a lot faster now, and I've got 16mb RAM,
so I'm just installing the Napalm demo :)

Lok!, I know its all only a joke, but being called gay and ugly is not
nice. I thought those comments were reserved for Michael Barrymore :)

I am taking a photo of me at school tomoorwo with our digital cam, so
I'll send that. Hopefully it won't be so bad. Attached is the same

Hello Gareth
     Hiya, Gareth... ,on 18-May-99 you mailed me about: 68030 Accelerators! So I`ma reply`in...

[=> Hi,
[=>   I got it! YES! My miggy is a lot faster now, and I've got 16mb RAM,
[=> so I'm just installing the Napalm demo :)

Yeah, It`s KEWL!!!!!!!.. What a totally kickass game, dont you agree?

[=> Lok!, I know its all only a joke, but being called gay and ugly is not
[=> nice. I thought those comments were reserved for Michael Barrymore :)

Me???? Geezus.. All I did was say the Chicken looked better.. PAH!...
If this is what I get for backing a chicken... I`ll have to do it more often
ahahahahahahaha!

I thought it was Pagman that was alegedly Gay?.. I never said anyone was
gay!! (except at the meet :), when everyone appeared to be gay, hahaha!
(No thanks to HawkEye being as Pissed as a dog with 3 legs :)))

Yes, you did.  And no, I didn't - I never got the token parsing to work
100%.
The closest I got was in my Investigator program (available on my website,
including the source).  But I had to put in several patches since some
libraries seemed to skip certain command numbers. 

And this, of course, is the key to the whole thing.

If anybody would care to take a crack at it, feel free.  The source code is
released as PD. I'm stumped (but admittedly I'm not much use when it comes
to hex math issues, so maybe somebody who is can figure out where I went
wrong...)

    Hello, =


    I just wanna know if anoyone of you had wrote a little tool
which will convert a bb2 tokenized file into standard Ascii
files. It could be very interresting to have a such tool,
especially if we can convert one directory at once (only
*.bb2 are converted).

    Or may be via an ARexx script ? As SuperTED seems to support
AREXX... Anyone has some docs ?

    The script will be :

Hey people,

I'm attempting to program a small OS-type-program which would be for use in 
schools to prevent people doing things they shouldn't and I have two 
questions.

1) Would there be anyway of letting a user grab hold of a GTShape gadget, 
drag it and drop it in another place on the screen?

2) Is there any way from Blitz in which I can stop Directories being 
accessed by the ASL file requester?

3) On a completely different subject, can someone provide me with some 
source to play audio CD's?

Thanks in advance
Neil

(if you want to send source code, but don't want to send it to the list, 
then don't use my hotmail address, use trogladite@trogsoft.freeserve.co.uk 
Thanks :)

The problem is that when files are passed under workbench, they get passed
in the WBStartup message (which is what wbstartup is supposed to sort out).
What you need is to be able to access the actual wb arg list, as each
icon/file that is passed by workbench is passed with a WA_Name, and a
WA_Lock, so all you do is as you parse the files, you simply call
currentdir_ with WA_Lock, and then you have access to the file as your in
the correct directory. As far as i know, wbstartup simply takes the WA_Name
and supplies it to the par$ array, but ignores the WA_Locks. You`d need a
wbstartup replacement, and you`d have to check for starting from dos too.
You also need to save the currentdir returned from your first currentdir
call, to replace it at the end of your program..otherwise you can cause
system hangs.

The NCS version of WBStartup returns the pointer to the WBMessage. Somethi=

    You should try the NWBStartup command from the NCS 1.80 which
return a pointer to the WBMessage (so you can get the lock) if the
program is started from the WB (else it return 0). Note that the
use of this function lock the Compiler V2.10.. I don't know why,
so test it trough your executable :-). On V1.7 it works so well...

Hello,

    I tried both of the suggested methods to no avail... Curt`s WBStartup
code would return: System:C/Test as the path the program was run from
when using "C:Test" as the default tool.. (this is what I`m trying to avoid)
And James`s code was the same as doing #CHDir# a$.. Which isn`t really what
I need, cos the program doesn`t know that it was run from an icon!
But thanks anyway guys, cheers.

I dont spoze the source for the CBM installer was ever released was it?

Attached is curts code done up like a kipper and an Icon, if anyone knows
anything else please help :)

Thanks again.

When an executable is used as a default tool, that executable gets the
name of the project at startup time. You can get this by using par$(1).

An example:

InstallFooBar is a script. It has an icon which calls Installer as it's
default tool. When this icon is clicked, Installer is run and receives
InstallFooBar as a parameter. You should be able to get CurrentDir()
from this and thus work out where you are.

OK, if I remember correctly, you simply wanted to "CD" to the directory
where the project icon was clicked, right?

If that's NOT what you want, this won't help a bit  ;)

So here's an example done up in straight Blitz commands.

Just make an exec and stuff it in SYS:c/ or elsewhere in the "path".

I tried it with both "SYS:c/fakeinstaller" and simply "fakeinstaller" as the
default tool of the project icon, and it works fine either way...

Note that there is a bugged version of the ElmoreDos.library out there that
has a non-functional ChDir command.  But it still tokenizes!

So, if this won't work for you, I {think} you must substitute "Examine" for
"ChDir"

If it still doesn't work, let me know and I'll send you the working version
of ElmoreDos.library.

After reading this, I thought, "Ace, I`ll download it now," before realizing
that I`m using a PC, not an Amiga - The Commodity is at home, so I`ll mail
you direct tomorrow afternoon (2 May) with it attached (I can do that can`t
I? - I hope so because some company asked me to send my CV to them by email,
and I sent it as an attachment - didn`t want to ring them to ask if they`d
received it, in case they concluded (rightly) that I didn`t have a clue what
I was doing (don`t worry, the job doesn`t need email knowledge)).

Do other programmers out there use brackets within brackets when writing in
English, or is it just me?

I think you must use your email address as the password.

And I'm not sure, but I think you must connect to the main Aminet directory
first, instead of trying to connect directly to "new/"

It took me a while to get my ftp program to connect to it the first time
(admittedly I'm pretty dense about this sort of thing) and I think that was
the problem.  Anyway, that's how I do it now, and it always works.

I just tried out the following on my PC (I used the FTP program which is
part of Windows (the DOS version), but you can use the same procedure with
any GUI FTP program, I guess):

1. Connect to the Internet
2. Run the program ftp (use Find and search for FTP)
3. Type the following:

    open ftp.uni-paderborn.de

    Username: anonymous

    Password: someno@somewhere.com (your e-mail infact)

    cd aminet

    cd new

    put myfile.lha

    put myfile.readme (of course you have to be in the right local
directory)

    close

    quit

The same procedure should work with any ftp client, if it's one with a
graphic interface, you just have to use the commend equivalents there.

I hope this was clear enough as I really don't now, how could someone
explain it easier.

Depends on the ftp-server on the other end to a certain extent. I
accidently did that mistake yesterday when uploading a Windows exe-file
to a clients machine and it worked on his end without a hitch. 

But most if not all command-line driven ftp-clients just use the bin
keyword. Hash, lcd and mput/mget can be useful too.

No - I`m thick as well - the main page of aminet has a help directory -
clicking on this will allow you to download a help file on uploading to
Aminet.

I downloaded CuteFTP for this PC - but I still couldn`t figure out how to do
it - the helpfile on Aminet states that if you don`t have FTP, you can use
email - you have to request the helpfile on how to do this with "HELP
UPLOAD" in the body of the mail - I received the helpfile, but it was even
more confusing than the FTP version.

I gave up - the Amiga community will never experience the delights of my
amazing programming abilities :)

Bippy

I`ve found the address for getting a helpfile on how to upload stuff by
email: send an email to:

aminet-server@aminet.net

with HELP UPLOAD in the body - I put it as the subject as well, to be on the
safe side.  The server will then send you a helpfile - if you figure out how
to do it - let me know.

I think you skipped the important bit with the sentence "You just upload
your stuff in the new directory."

How do you do this if you don`t have FTP?  Have you read the file on how to
upload via email?

I tried CuteFTP on this PC - but couldn`t get access - it said invalid
password - and yes I logged on as anonymous.

Thank you to all those who gave me advice on how to upload to Aminet,
especially Damir Arh, and thanks to Curt for his offer to upload stuff for
me (didn`t like to impose).

I`ve just used DOS FTP on this PC - I think it worked, but I`m not entirely
sure - I used mput at first, and it started putting a load of Windows BMPs
so I had to shut it down.  I then tried it with simply `put` and it seemed
to work - guess I`ll know in 4-5 days.

BTW, I had to drop the bit before the @ because it wouldn`t accept it

zalda@home4968.freeserve.co.uk

Thanks again.

You'll probably find that's due to the stupid PC software industries
tendency to make up their own standards.  Tell it you don't want to log on
as anonymous and put in "anonymous" as your user-name and
"whatever@the.hell.your.email.is", and make sure you're connecting to
de.aminet.net and not wuarchive.wustl.edu

Just a little point.  The version of ftp on the windows machines here default
to ASCII mode which means that binary files don't survive the transfer.  You
have to change the ftp client into binary mode (try typing "help" into the
client to get a list of commands) for the archive and then back to ASCII for
the readme.

I would say you launch an ARexx macro from within a Blitz program

Hi,

I am still trying to get my first assem program working it now runs
and the values stay in the registers it turned out to be the variable
num was set as .l but all the assembler instructions where using bytes
this was why i was getting wierd values. :)

My code almost runs but does not jump the way i want it is only
supposed to jump if one number is higher than the other but instead it
jump regardless i have included the code if anyone wants to try it or
tell me why it jumps when it should'nt. :(

num is set as num.b at the top of the code not inside the macro

I see it should be cmp.b not cmp.l because all the values are bytes
I should of spotted that mistake tryed changing it and it still does
not jump for some reason ?

Do not understand this are you saying they have to be converted into
.l or that i am using .l instead of .b ?

Thanks for the help :)

Just a tad note, in macro INP, is "num" a quick/float/byte/word or a 
longword? This is important to know.

I'm not able to execute your code right now, but when .assem is executed, 
the line "MOVE.b d0,d1" etc only copies a byte from d0 to d1, however when 
executing "CMP.l d1,d2", d1 and d2 compares a whole longword, not just only 
just a byte of d2 with d1.

So, check what values are getting stored in d0 and d1 before executing the 
comparsion and if it's a quick/float/byte/word or a longword. If you're 
using "CMP.l" you need to be sure that the upper 7 bytes of d1/d2 are 
containing the same values (in this case zero is preffered), thus the CMP.l 
should give the correct result.

Excuse me if this was weird understanging, It's only 8 in the mornin' and 
I'm deadly tired - darn Robert Jordan writing good books =)

It changes stack (a7) to whatever register you pass as a prameter, loads t=
hat 
register from the new position of the stack and then increases the positio=
n of 
the stack by 4. Commonly used if you have done a LINK instruction, but a r=
eason 
why it could be crashing is that you have not returned the stack to what i=
t was 
before (i.e. after doing LINK, you have changed the address register and n=
ot 
put it back).

NOTRick Berry here.

Does anyone know about how UNLK a4 works? This is
currently how I'm producing assembler code that might
run without crashing. I'm certain it has something to
do with simply not knowing enough about assembler. I'm
going to forward a blitterline program shortly. Yeah I
know everyone's gone Chunky to Planar.

Oh, where can I get information on Gurus on machines

If it says it's from Rick Berry above please ignore that. Thankyou :-(

Here's the program that I've had troubles with. I goes for a software
failutre, and the fill routine needs to be revised.

 Hey the 500, does quite nicely in 16 colours and 640*256! You just need

  How much is the Ateo64, as I think that plugs into the clock port?

  Ya can do it the cheap way, if you're good at tinkering :) There's a
hack on Aminet to desolder your keyboard connector on the motherboard,
so you can use your 1200 keyboard, by making an extension. Then all you
need to do is mount your motherboard in a full tower (I got one
second-hand), and adapt a connector for a PC power supply.
  A bit of work, but cheap!

  It depends how much money you've got. If you can get a second-hand A2k
keyboard cheap then yes, otherwise it's cheap if you're able to do it,
and you still have the original 1200 case, and LEDS.
  Apparently you should be able to wire up a 500 keyboard like the A2k
as well.

  A1300_V2.0.lha  in hard/hacks for the rehousing the 1200 keyboard.
Also there's:

1200Tower21.lha
A1200tower_XTR.txt
TowerFit.lha   
XtPcPower.lha  

 As some are better at certain procedures than others (like PSU
connector).

Hello Donovan

not you may not, it's an exclusive club, for people who think that 640K
ought to be enough for anyone.....

Failing that, we could all wonder why (how?) he's using netscape on a 030,
it can't be much faster than a screen shot...

A little patience heh, let me say I dont use a GFX card I surfed on an 030
for 18 months and it's tolerable, if you don't use images, and use say
aweb, it'll probably be quite snappy, using imagery forgt going beyond 64
cols, which is still quite slow, as to using a 500 for surfin, I don't
think I could stand seeing a system that couldn't decode a 9600 baud
download in less than realtime, granted on a 28.8 I could get the 030 to
choke, but on a 500 can you say crawling...... sadist :) 

though this thread has gotten off topic, how about the on topic suggestion
of writing a text based browser for offline browsing (I don't want to using
something existing, I've got a few ideas on what I'd like to do but haven't
got the slightest idea where to start)

Well, I don't know about the DBL modes (do they slow things down?)

But I have an 030/50 and browse in 256 colours in hi-res-laced (with a
flicker-fixer and FBlit).  Although it's not particularly fast, it's
certainly not painfully slow.

True, there are some badly-coded and/or graphically overloaded web sites
that take ages to load.  But I've tried some of these on my sister's 400
mhz pentium, and they're not all that much faster.

And an 030 is miles better than a 020/14  ;)

There was a serious of tutorials on blitz in AF a while ago, with the idea
of creating a web browser...that would be a good place to start, as you
could easily add to it.

Well I`ve got the last archive I could find, it`s by John Kennedy (I think),
from 96 I believe. I was going to use this as a base for a simple web
browser, and having the gfx in fast ram ;)...but I never got around to it.
There are some problems with this:

It doesn`t support all known tags, just the basic ones.
It tries to allocate a bitmap the size of the page, so a huge scrolling
document wouldn`t fit in memory
It only supports iff pictures.

The original version is in the browser.lha archive, and my version with some
modifications and bugs removed and a general tidy up is in there too (so you
can use that as a start point if you want). It shouldn`t be hard to create a
text only version, with proper spacing where the inline pictures would
normally be. (btw, the last version was browser2.bb2).


Dave

P.s. I haven`t sent the archive to the list, just to blitzwing, as it`s
+50k. I don`t think John minds what you do with it, so long as you credit
him with the foundation code :).

He`s upgraded from a bog standard A1200. When you add fastram and an 030 it
seems like you`ve got a rocket....but after a while when you`ve got used to
it, it doesn`t seem that fast at all. I think it`s unlikely you can play
those games..but I don`t see why you need more power for internet
use...that`s one of those things I hate, like bintel saying you NEED a PIII
for the internet, when of course that`s just silly overpowering, and just a
cheap trick to sell chips. A lot of the companies I`ve talked to think you
need a PIII 500, with 256mb ram, and a 10gb hard drive before you can use
the web! (and it`s all down to advertising!). I was amazed when I met
someone on irc using a stock A600 on the internet. It`s pretty cool
though..you trying doing that with a 386!

it's about £130, and it plugs into the accellerator slot. 
Another small card plugs into that, the accellerator then plugs
onto /that/, and so does the ISA slot card, on a couple of ribbin
cables.

Just make sure you don't hook those up with a Power Flyer because it won't
work with the Ateo Bus. I found that out the hard way....

Well, Gareth shouldn't get too excited about web browsing with an 030,
but adding a graphics card to a standard A1200 is pretty costly :

  Tower (A1200-ready)   : =A375 (Eyetech)
  Zorro board           : =A3150-ish
  Gfx card              : =A3150-ish for cheapest
  Keyboard, i/face, etc : =A320-40
  VGA Monitor           : =A350-90
  ---------------------------
  Total                 : over =A3400! Ow!

These are the cheapest prices I've found (OK, you can get a 2nd hand VGA =
monitor
for =A330), but I won't be adding a gfx card to my 1200 anytime soon!

I get by in Hi-Res Laced in 16 colours using MagicTV to cure the nasty =

interlace flicker, and it's generally quite nice to use, though it'd
obviously be much better with all the above gear :)

Oh, and I use FBlit to put all Voyager/AWeb, etc's hidden bitmaps into fa=
stmem,
which helps a lot too...

First of all you have to but the AteoBus, which is the more expensive
of the two required items. This is a bus board that has 4 slots to
therefore take 4 cards. Ateo make a number of cards now, serial,
parallel, sound card, graphics card, etc. Then you buy an Ateo Pixel64
which plugs into one of the slots. You need a tower btw. When I bought
mine it was a total price of about 240 ukp, although that was from
white knight techonologies which are renownd for being quite
expensive, and as someone else said you might get it for 200 now. I
bought a tower, 6xspeed cdrom, a4000 keyboard and AteoIO1 card at the
same time so the upgrade was somewhatmore costly for me.

Nah, plugs into the CPU bus, with a pass through for Accel boards.  And the
Ethernet card hasn't materialised yet, all they've said is they had it
working on their internal network in Jan.

According to www.http2.com it now works with all browsers.  That is assuming

When you say "modifying the status variables of those audio channels", what 
are you exactly referring to?
Modifying the register showing what DMA channels are being used at that

Can't do any examples, because I don't have any time. :(

Hello Daniel,
 
I had to alter the code slightly to get it to work here :)

It seems that doing the 

DEFTYPE.DimensionInfo DimInfoBuf   and the
DEFTYPE.NameInfo      NamInfoBuf

inside the function was affecting the third passed param in the
function (weird?)

I had to move the DEFTYPE's outside and use SHARED DimInfoBuf etc.

See attached.

 Having been down that road myself, I would suggest that you
first make the user interface for rubber-banding paths extremely good.  I
haven't yet seen a PC program that lets you create and modify
connections in an intuitive and sensible way. 

Keep at it!

Hi Evan.

Rubber-bandng will be a pre. But I'm still at the starting stage:
-wrote a interface <Must rebuild it with Mildred because I cann't display on
GFX-cards :(   >
-wrote the tools for plotting/moving/deleting solderpads.
-tried to figure out a autoroute algorithm by my self.

Today I searched for the Lee Algorithm and got almost 3.000.000 links!
This algorithm is used by Ultiboard internally. If I manage to put this
algorithm in my
program then I will search for ripup-and-retry algoritms.

Greetings,  Henry.

I might be there, or I might not - it depends on how I cope with mIRC which
is downloading at the moment.

As I`ve said, I`m new to this lark, and am confused - because I use Internet
Explorer to talk on #amirc and #amiga on the undernet - in the address it
reads:

    http://www662.dircon.co.uk/chat/

which is a page that asks you for your nickname, before letting you enter -
you then just type:

    /join #amiga                   ;or whatever

or

   /list

for a list of rooms.

Can I not do the same for Dalnet?

Anyway, if I can figure out how to use mIRC before tonight, I`ll see you
there.

Hi.

So that you have a little bit more time to be forewarned, let me just
remind you that a bunch of blitz maniacs converge at 8pm BST tomorrow

  Cool! Can we put it's address on the line after the unsubscribe info,

  Also, when you get it going well, you should mention it to Amiga Org

Hi Blitzers!

After two months colllecting data...

I want to inform you that a new update of the BB-Developer-List was done.=
 It
contains now more than 200 (!!) people.

You find it at: =

                                       BBLIST_D.HTM  (german)

It lies on you that the list is always up-to-date. Check the information =
about
you on the site and send me new/corrected data.

For all new blitzers (which are not listed on the site):

Send me the informations about you:

  Name
  Email
  Homepage
  Blitz Projects
  Amiga (model, ram, HD, ...)
  Others (nickname, group,...)


(PS: For BippyM - you are sorted in the list with your real name ;-)

A long time ago when I was working on standard gadgets I was using
Buttongroup instruction. Now I would like to rewrite some old programs to
GadTools gadgets but there is no instruction like that in Gadtools gadgets.
So I've no idea how to create few GTButton or GTShape gadgets to work as a
GTMX gadget (when one i pressed all others are unselected). Maybe someone
have working axample before I start to write my own routine?

I don`t think there is a version for GTgadgets - but did you see the example
I gave to Rostislav`s problem - I think the thread was "GTButton Colour" -
anyway, I`ve just found my original mail in the "sent items" box - here it
is.  You just need to keep a record of which gagdet is highlighted, then
check which gadget the user clicks on - then use GTToggle to change them.

BlitzGUIGen will create all the Gadtools gadgets you'll need in conjunction
with GadToolsBox.

According to that masterpiece of the English language, "The Blitz
Basic 2 User Guide", there is a GTMX  exclusion gadget.  Maybe that's
what you are looking for??

  I know this has been asked on the list recently, but I didn't think
I'd need it.  :-) 
  I've had contact with an old Blitz user, who has gone to the PC a
couple of years back, and wants to get back into games programming, and
the PC isn't very friendly for it. He wants to know where he can buy a
copy of Blitz, and I suppose the BSS suite as well. It'll have to be
Mail order as he's in NZ.

  Also, how do you access the stack pointer in assem in blitz, as the
devpac way of doing it doesn't seem to work. I want to save the
registers on the stack and restore them.

I don`t know about that but I have a copy of ultimate blitz on cd that I
don`t want...

yeah..unfortunatly sp doesn`t exist in blitz...just replace that with a7..ie

movem.l d0-d1/a0-a1,-(a7)        ;save these blighters
move.l #0,d0                                ;just a silly and useless
example to seperate the two movem`s
movem.l (a7)+,d0-d1/a0-a1        ;restore the original regs

but a7 is fine, because as far as I know, motorola never changed the stack
pointer address register (which is a good job...though why they didn`t have
a special register I`ll never know...just think of the cycles you could
shave off c2p routines if they did!)

Not trying to do Dave out of a sale, but that's one of the two sections on=
 the 
blitz2000 website that *is* written. Look in the about section. And if you=
 find 
any other companies that sell it, let me know.

I just had a look at their webpage - nothing but generic chess and bridge =
games 
that came out about 10 years ago (probably not even for the Amiga) and loa=

I know. It's utter rubbish.

Hmm :) Well, I didn't get to do much really. They said 'Here! Fold these
boxes'
or 'Here! Assemble these CD cases'. And most of the time I just sat around
with
the receptionist person (who was my age, 17) and talked to her all the time.
Wonder if that's classed as 'Good work' :)

They did give me £130 of miggy software though when I finished. There's no
harm in asking for a discount is there :)

  Ohh!  Oh well, it's been good working with ya [sniff] [sniff] :-( 
Thanks for the Mildred lib- it'll save me huge amounts of work! Good
luck with whatever you do!

  Ps: do you think you could release the source code for Mildred to
Aminet or the List, if you're not going to be programming any more?

  Seeya- Anton  :)

I'm sorry to see you go (as I'm sure others on the list are as well).

Best of luck to you in whatever you tackle in the future, and many thanks
for your Mildred library, and other advice and ideas.

  Oh, wow!  This was unexpected.  Rats!!

  Hey Paul,
  It is with considerable reluctance that we bid you adeau.  How about
dropping in from time to time to say hello at least?  We will miss you.
You have been a very good friend to us all, helping out where you could
and offering encouragement and stability.  And thank you especially for
bringing us Mildred, which I am only just beginning to use and understand.

  Please don't let the fact thet you have said goodbye deter you from
returning any time you wish and for however long you wish!


cacha later, (I hope)

    Wow, this is kind of a surprise! I guess you have you reasons for your
decision so I won't even ask. Anyway, thanks for answering all my stupid
questions over the years (or however long it's been) and for trying to teach
me assembler. (I did actually retain some of what we went over!) It's a shame
that the Amiga community will be losing a talented person like you, but after
all it's only a computer and I'm sure you're on to pursue more important
endevours. Good luck in whatever you do. 

PS- How about releasing the source for that cool Coke can demo with the funky
ground scrolling thing? :)

It's a shame to be losing you, you've been a great help to the
BB2/Amiga community.

Good luck in whatever you have planned for the future and, if you ever

Hi everyone,

Does anybody know if the system call:

It's not supposed to, but does anybody out there have a 68000 to try it on?

Thanks...

Afraid not, but as it's an OS call I would think the that OS would cancel it
if it wasn't appropriate to the CPU.

Yes, it works (for me anyway) - you must redraw the gadget after you do

According to the acid docs (grrrr) GTToggle gtlist,buttonid,On|Off works f=
or 
GTButtons, but I don't think it ever worked for me.

But, if you do something like this:

*g.Gadget =3D GTGadPtr(gtlist,buttonid)
oldpos.w=3DRemoveGadget_(Peek.l(Addr Window(windownum)),*g)
*g\Flags =3D *g\Flags | #GFLG_SELECTED
AddGadget_ Peek.l(Addr Window(windownum)),*g,oldpos
Redraw windownum,buttonid

This will highlight your button and keep it there. To unhighlight, you do:

*g.Gadget =3D GTGadPtr(gtlist,buttonid)
oldpos.w=3DRemoveGadget_(Peek.l(Addr Window(windownum)),*g)
*g\Flags =3D *g\Flags & NOT(#GFLG_SELECTED)
AddGadget_ Peek.l(Addr Window(windownum)),*g,oldpos
Redraw windownum,buttonid

You could try ScreenPens, or set up your own palette for the screen you are
using - assuming you are opening your own screen.

If I understand your needs correctly, you could change the flags for the
specific gadget so that the text is in the highlight colour (white
usually) - if you look at the Gadget Flags, the first few state where the
label for the button should be (left, above, in, etc)  - then there is a
flag that makes the colour of the text white.

If you`re using my FLAGS commodity, which I`ve recently attached to 2
mails - click on Gadget Flags, and that will tell you what the value is to
make the text highlighted - though it`s also in the manual, and in the
on-line help somewhere.

Alternatively, I think that TextGadget allows you to specify a colour, but
I`m not sure, as I never use Blitz`s gadgets - I always use the GT ones.

If there is a way to change the colour other than this, I don`t know what it
is, but someone else might.

Hope this helps

Rostislav

First of all, you may know this already, but if you don't put

  WBStartup

at the top of your program, it will crash when you make it executable.
It will run fine from TED, but you will need to put this line in at
some point.

As far as your code goes - when I ran it, there was a syntax error with
the GTButton line - there were one too many parameters at the end -

  GTButton 0,dny_odpocet+100,10+(dny_v_tydnu*(6*6)),
    (dny_odpocet_poz*15)+100,30,15,Str$(dny_odpocet),0,1

I assume you were messing about with it, and simply forgot to correct it
when you sent the source.  The 0,1 at the end should be only one value
containing the flags.

  GTBUTTON GTList#,id,x,y,w,h,Text$,Flags

You are right, however, about $20 (white text) not working with GTButton
I'd forgotten about this - I wrote a program called Anserine, that had
some tool-buttons, and I wanted to highlight the currently selected tool.
In the end I simply drew a box in colour 3 around the relevant button.

As far as TextGadget goes, you CAN highlight it with the 'Toggle' command,
or change the colour with the GadgetPens command.
You also need to use BorderPens to change the highlight/shadow colours,
as they are inverted by default.

 - see the attached example - you can also make it part of a
'ButtonGroup' to make the date buttons mutually exclusive, like GTMX.
If you've got the Blitz 2.1 manual, read the section on GADGET COMMANDS
(page 188 in mine).  This example doesn't bother working out where the
gadgets need to go in relation to the day of the week, it's simply
designed to show you it's possible to do what you want.
You may need to alter window size/gadget distances, depending on your
screen size, font size.

If you want more than one gadget to be highlighted, don't put them in
a buttongroup


I personally, don't like using these types of gadgets, and think there
must be a way to do it with GTButtons - as the Workbench Time preferences
program uses this method to highlight the current date.  Someone on the
list must know how it's done.

Anyone?

BTW - There are 2 attachments of the same file, one is simple ascii,
the other is the same ascii file, but archived - as I download stuff on
a  PC, and whenever I transfer ascii files to my Amiga, I end up with
lots of bad characters at the end of each line in TED - wheras if they
are archived, I can unarchive them, retaining proper ansi.  The reason
I have attached normal ascii with this archive, is just in case you are
not able to unLZX this archive - though LZX is now free, so you should
have it.  But in future I will only attach LZXed files - just in case
the same thing happens from PC to Amiga.  I've only attached the normal
ascii file in case you don't have LZX.

Hope this helps.

Hi Rostislav

Just a quick note about that example I sent you on how to highlight
TextGadgets.  I hate to have a bad example of coding floating around,
so thought I`d mention that since having a closer look at my example, I`ve
noticed something that is a bit terrible.  The call to Len(text$) is
completely unnecessary

    If ButtonNum<10 then text$+" "

would have been better - that way there isn`t a slower call to Len, and
there wouldn`t be a requirement to link Len into the program (though it`s
probably in the same library as str$, so would be linked anyway).

I blame this glaring error on the fact that I was more concerned in
demonstrating how to toggle TextGadgets on and off, and was less concerned
with the overall elegance of the example.

BTW have you seen David`s reply - I think I`ll check this out myself
tonight.

Hi Rostislav

After David McMinn's posting yesterday, making me aware of GTToggle,
I've updated the example to use GTButton instead of TextGadget - there
is now an extra part to the example that detects which gadget has been
selected, and unhighlights/highlights as appropriate.

David said that he couldn't get this to work, but I think he was just
being polite, as it worked perfectly first time.

Thanks, David.

There is now no need to add a space to one-digit numbers, as Intuition
automatically centres text in GTButtons.  And I've moved the toggle
command out of the first loop, as it was executing 31 times
unnecessarily.

The new example is below.

VIC



WBStartup

NoCli
ButtonNum.b=0
ColNum.b=1
RowNum.b=1
blob$=Date$(SystemDate)      ;needed in order for DAYS to acquire number

  GTButton 0,50+ButtonNum,30*ColNum,20*RowNum,30,20,text$,$10
  ColNum+1: If ColNum>7 Then ColNum=1: RowNum+1
Until ButtonNum=31

Subject: CIA Interrupts are Go!!!!

  I've finally got the CIA interupts allocating and firing! The main
problem I was having with the firing part, was I was using an '&'
instaed of an '?' for the interrupt routine label....  DOHHHHH!  Well,
I was used to getting label addresses in assem, and you use a '&'!!

  Anyway, I'll put it on the list when I've tidied it up. It does seem
to vary slightly under load (weirdly, it fires more when under load!),
so I don't think I'll be able to use it for a long term timer :-(  I'll
do some more testing and get back to ya.
 - Looks like I'll have to use Dave's suggestion after all :-)

 Ps: I've had it firing 436 times per 50th (updating a count variable),
with no noticeable CPU use on the 040!! That's 21,800 times a second! 

    Seeya- Anton

  The embarrasing thing is it's the second time I've done it now!! :-s 
I spent several days fighting paper Boa Constrictors, reading the
dissasemblies of the C object code and the CIA resource (which I had to
peek around around in memory to find first, as it's not on disk)! :-) 
Only to come back to debugging the Blitz code to find the pointer to
the code pointed to nothing- oops. But it wasn't all a waste of time as
I found out in the process that the interrupt code ends in an RTS,
rather than an RTE as the documentation on execeptions I had, said. It
crashes with a RTE BTW.

  About 6% between idle and 100% CPU use (a mousewait command). But this
is firing at 21,800 times a sec- it might be better at a reasonable rate
(the slowest is about 5 times a sec).

  It should be alright for that- I probably can't use it, as I'm using
it to keep multiplayers over the internet all on the same time, and the
variation is probably too much. Also looking at the hardware specs in
the DEV docs:
 BFE401  talo  CIAA timer A low byte (.715909 Mhz NTSC; .709379 Mhz PAL)
It might fire slightly differently on NTSC and PAL systems, but
obviously won't be affected by GFX card screens.
  I'll have to check if the VBlank timer is affected by GFX cards- I'll
have to whip a small test program- should be easy with the CIA 
timers :-) 

 Anyway, here's the program to have a play with: it's pretty messy at
the moment- I'll fix that up. To allocate a CIA-B timer first put
preferA=#False# in #FindFreeTimer#.
 
  Ps: How do you exit an assem only function again?

I'm looking foward to the finished code.  By varying, how much in-accuracy
is there?

I don't need anything but a fairly reliable 60th second regardless of
screenmode.

Subject: Cia Interrupts in Blitz

--BOUNDARY.2016907952.3

  I'm converting a Dev CD C example, of doing a CIA interrupt (OS legal)
to Blitz. Now I've got a problem, with one of the commands (code
attached below). #AddICRVector_a# freezes the compiler, before the code
executes, and crashes if the debugger is off- you can hit the Panic!
button and everything is fine (and you can keep doing it- normally
it'll crash the second time). Can a couple of people test it to check I
don't have a corrupted lib- ta.
  I suspect there's a problem with ciaa.resource1 and ciab.resource1
libs (and it hasn't been found yet, as no-one's done any CIA stuff :),
as the Autodocs only have one set of commands for both CIA's,
ie: it has just #AddICRVector# . I'll probably replace the libs with an
FD convert of the cia_lib.fd (in place of ciaa.resource1), and then
everything will be in line with the RKMs. Also it'll give us a free
library slot where ciab.resource1 is! :-)
  What do ya reckon- should I do it, and then Fred can update his
official libs list. 

  And yes, I'll put the code on the list, soon as I get it working :-)

 I'm doing it for multi-player games, so we can have an accurate timer,
no matter the screen rate- I think from memory (I'll have to check),
that timer B on the CIA-B chip, has highest priority, and can't be
interrupted by anything, so should work well.
   From reading the docs they say that the V-Blank interrupt is accurate
over long periods. Does any one know if it changes to the GFX card
rate, or does it still stay at NTSC/PAL rates when a GFX card screen is
up?
  I'll test the CIA timer later- I've got an extra bare 1200- I'll put
one under CPU stress, and the other idling, and see if there's any
deviance after a couple of hours!

  I'll check it out, or chat to him sometime- I suspected as much, as I
FD converted the cia_lib.fd, and that didn't work, or acted the same as
the original libs! I knew it was weird, as it wasn't behaving like my
programs normally do when I've screwed up! :)

 Oh, it's fun! First you have to try and figure out the C code, then
then OS stuff, and finally the example hits the hardware (I think it
should have used an OS call instead actually)! The hardware hitting was
the easiest, as I used to program C64s :-)

  But would that do things OS legal? As using the CIA resource you check
wether a timer has been allocated first, and then allocate it if it
hasn't. I've got an example from Aminet on hitting the hardware direct
in assem if you want to do it that way :-)

  Yeah it does with NTSC and PAL (60/50hz), but does it change if you
open a screen on a GFX card (say if it was running at 75hz)? If you
could get it's frequency from the OS, it would be ok- as long as the
user didn't switch screens and the frequency changed...   :-/

  Yeah, to make sure the timers on all machines in a multi-player game,
are all running the same. And also, for a 2D game, to make sure objects
move at the correct speed.
  Does anyone know, if you can select a certain frequency rate for a GFX
card screen (maybe using some of the selection code already posted to
the List)? Say for example only select a 640*480 screen running at
50hz.
  If you couldn't, you'd have to drop frames to get it running
correctly.

   You, should see some of the things I've done while playing Quake!
Replying to ICQ messages while in the middle of a multi-player
firefight (well not for long ;), etc (the Amiga is amazing at this sort
of
thing :-).
   It's not really idiot-proof enough for me :-/ Neither is the CIA
method, as a bad program could hit the hardware and stuff it up as
well, but it's a lot less likely. Maybe with a few logical checks it
could be used. The same would be needed for the CIA method as well.

   Can you allocate the Timer you want, as only the CIA-B ones are
accurate, as they can't be interrupted by any other source. Here's some
docs from Exceptions.lha on Aminet:

 3. What is in the exception table?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The table is a list of addresses. It is split into 3 sections:

1. Error exceptions. These occur when the processor can't continue.
2. Autovectors. These occur when the processor's INTx pins are touched.
3. Trap vectors. These occur when a TRAP #x command occurs.

------------------

$64  Autovector 1 - see below.
$68  Autovector 2 - see below. This handles CIA A.
$6C  Autovector 3 - see below. This handles the display and blitter     
                               ints.
$70  Autovector 4 - see below. This handles the audio interrupts.
$74  Autovector 5 - see below.
$78  Autovector 6 - see below. This handles CIA B.
$7C  Autovector 7 - see below. This is the Non Maskable Interrupt.

-----------------------------------

 4. Autovectors - external causes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The autovectors are the only source of interrupts external to the
MC680x0. They are prioritised, so if a level 1 interrupt is occuring
and a level 2 requires processing in the middle of this, the lev1 is
stopped and the lev2 is handled. This can go on up to lev7 - the non
maskable interrupt. The lev 7 cannot be turned off and cannot be
stopped once it starts. This is how the Action Replay works.

The autovectors on the MC680x0 can be caused by one of two things. The
first is a hardware hacker banging on the processor's INTx pins. This is
more commonly caused by something like an Action Replay cartridge.
 
The other way autovectors get called is via the Paula chip. Paula is
very clever, and she does some multiplexing to turn the 7 interrupts
into 14! Basically, of the 14 possible system interrupts, anything
between 1 and 4 are handled by a single autovector. The interrupts
generated can be set by the INTENA custom register. An interrupt is
started by either hard or software writing into Paula's INTREQ
register. Paula sees this and checks from her INTENAR register to see
if the interrupt is meant to be on. If it is she causes the correct
autovector exception to happen. This autovector should check which
interrupt caused it, then turn off the correct INTREQ flag.

Here is a table of interrupts:

Vec. Int. Name     Means this has happened
 1    0   TBE      Generated by the CIA B chip - the serial port's      
                  transmit
                   buffer is empty and needs refilling/restarting.
 1    1   DSKBLK   Generated by Paula when the disk hardware has        
                    finished
                   reading the specified disk track into memory
 1    2   SOFTINT  Generated by exec - ie in software. Read the RKMs! A
                   software interrupt is used to do lots of work that   
                     needs
                   a higher priority than tasks but not interrupts.
 2    3   PORTS    Generated by the CIA A timer chip
 3    4   COPER    Generated by the copper at a specific screen         
                   location.
                   This is a cheat - the copper is programmed by the    
                    coder
                   to write $10 into INTREQ, but it allows the copper to
                   identify itself as the source of the interrupt.
 3    5   VERTB    Generated by Denise/Lisa when the vertical blank     
                   starts.
                   The vertical blank is when the bottom of the screen  
                  is
                   reached by the electron beam in the telly and it has 
                   flick back up to the top of the screen.
 3    6   BLIT     Generated by Agnus/Alice when the blitter finishes
                   drawing.
 4    7   AUD0     Generated by Paula when she finishes playing a sound 
                   on
                   audio channel 2
 4    8   AUD1     Generated by Paula when she finishes playing a sound 
                   on
                   audio channel 0
 4    9   AUD2     Generated by Paula when she finishes playing a sound 
                   on
                   audio channel 3
 4   10   AUD3     Generated by Paula when she finishes playing a sound 
                   on
                   audio channel 1
 5   11   RBF      Generated by the CIA B chip - the serial port's      
                  recieve
                   buffer is full, and you should empty it for more data
                   get in.
 5   12   DSKSYNC  Generated by Paula, when the disk hardware finds a   
                     disk
                   syncword to indicate the start of a track. The reason
                   this is such a high priority if because you only have
                    a few microseconds to start the disk hardware      
                      reading or
                   writing data before the disk has spun too far.
 6   13   EXTER    Generated by the CIA B timer chip. This is more      
                  precise than the CIA A timer because it is guaranteed
                    not to be preempted by another Amiga interrupt.
Only                     the NMI can stop it, and that's not likely as
only                       external hardware can cause one.

                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                 We want this one!! :-) 
 I remember something about timer B on CIA-B having priority over timer
A on CIA-B. But I'll have to check that out.

No, your library is OK - or else, mine is bad too.  It does exactly the same

GREAT!  I've been trying to figure this out for a long time, with no luck...

BTW, there are also some similar cia-timer commands for the Lowlevel.library
which I wanted to try (as it looks much simpler) but there is no Blitz
"lowlevel.library1", at least not in my version.

Does anybody have one, or the fd file for lowlevel.library?

I think it changes, and possibly also changes with different "monitor"
settings, but I can't check it as I have no GFX card, and only can use
PAL/NTSC monitors...

Does anybody know?

What I really want is a way to know how many seconds have passed (or better,
1/60th seconds), regardless of the Screen mode.

I think so, although it really doesn't say.  It looks like it does the
allocation stuff for you, and returns 0 if all the timers are spoken for.

You just supply the pointer to the interrupt routine.

Well, for my purposes I need to know the seconds.  Not necessarily how many
have passed, but at least how many VBlanks there are per second.

What I'm doing is loading sound samples, and reading the iff header to
determine the playing time for each sample.  This is returned as seconds,
since samples always play at the same speed, regardless of VBlank rate.

Then I use this information to know how long to disable the music on a sound
channel while the sound is playing, and turn it back on when the sound is
done.

If I know what the Vblank rate is, I can also convert it to use that.

But with the earlier code that was posted, I could run a little test to
determine that.

You can fetch the vblank frequency value from execbase, or maybe it`s from
gfxbase. I should imagine that one of those will tell you how many vblanks
happen per second. (do these change when your in different screen modes?? I
would have thought so...ie, ntsc/pal)

Do you really need couting down timers?? Why not simply call CurrentTime. It
returns the current seconds.l and microseconds.l in two memory variables
(useful for blitz)...ie

seconds.l=0:micros.l=0

CurrentTime_ &seconds,&micros

That`s what I usually use, and it hasn`t failed me yet..(ie, micro seconds
are accruate enough for me...1000th of a second accuracy!)

It`s a pity your not playing the music samples using the audio device, as
then you can just send requests with higher prioritys and the audio device
sorts it all out, ie, you could have music playing, and then a long sample
starts, and in the middle of that a smaller sample with a higher priority
cuts in, and then returns to the long sample and after that the music ;),
but then I love devices ;)

Yes..I wondered that too. I think were talking about execbase vbf. I think
that is the base frequency for machine ntsc/pal. But I seem to remember
something in gfxbase about vblanks too, maybe it`s the current vblank or
something..I`m not sure. Are you sure you need to know how many vb per
second?? Ie, you could not simply count vblanks, and have a counter
continually going up?? (ie, are seconds important??)

Well, I use that as the current local time, number of seconds since midnight
(I think), so all I do is check for the new_seconds<last_seconds_check and
if that`s true...we`ve gone thru midnight and I just add the difference (to
make sure the wrap around is correct). Someone could change this...but I
don`t think it`s that likely while they are playing a game. As far as I`m
concerned, it`s just a micro second+second timer for me, I don`t care what
the actual time is, so it doesn`t matter if they haven`t got a RTC, as I
just use the difference as a stopwatch.

If you want the vblanks for the current screen, I think you pass its
screenmode ID to FindDisplayInfo_(ID) and then pass the "handle" that
returns to GetDisplayInfoData_(), which you can ask for the monitor
information apparently (I'm just reading the autodocs and guessing
here, but hopefully, it'll point someone in the right direction ;)

Subject: CIA update

  First I have de good news, and de bad news, and some more good news,
and more bad news! ;)
  Well, I got Julian Kinraid's FD converted CIA resource, and it
allocates timers OK, *BUT*, it only allocates CIA-A timers, as it
ignores the resource parameter, and just hardcodes to the CIA-A
resource :-/ As the Battclock.resource uses CIA-A timer B, you can't
use anything but CIA-A timer A.
  I've got the interrupt firing finally (it took some weird pointer
work- you're right about pointers in Blitz, David!), *BUT*, it crashes
as soon as it fires! :-/ Now I think it's again down to the buggered
resource (as the AbleICR_ and SetICR_ don't cause the interupt to fire
either, when they should)- it doesn't seem to change the exception
table pointer to my routine, so I think it's just executing any random
memory!!. PS: does anyone know the location of the VBR on the 040, as I
can't find it in the OS includes?
  So.. I've got the Cia resource lib offsets (using an assem pragma
converter), and I'll try calling them direct, and see if they work.
I'll use AbleICR_ as well, instead of hitting the hardware as the Dev
CD example does- shocking!!!

 Oh well, I'm getting better at OS stuff! :-)

Its just a bad hack that runs blitz2, loads your source file and then 
compile/runs it or create executable. It des this by simulating mouse even=

You could use the tag #GTLV_ScrollWidth to reduce the width of the
scrollbar&arrows down to 1 pixel which would make it "invisible" 

The only problem is that this can produce funny looking results with some
programs that patch gadtools.

And if your program allows users to select a differnt font or uses their
screen's font, will all the items still show in the listview?

Hi men,

Is there a way to open a GTListView gadget without the scroll bar and arr=
ows (I don't need them because my listview is tall enough to show all the=
 items)? I suppose not, so I wonder if there are OS functions to clip off=
 an area (graphics.library or layers.library) so that, when drawing the l=
istview, the scroll bar would be left off. Is it possible using Blitz?

See ya...

I tried this by using the GTTags and GTSetAttrs commands but it seems tha=
t Blitz doesn't take them into account. The scroll bar is always 16 pixel=
s wide.

Yes, so I think that using OS functions to clip off an area would be bett=
er, but... is it possible?

Yes, because the listview is sized according to the font height and the i=
tems contained in it are always the same.

Hi,
Just a quick question. Can you use the Colourwheel gadget in Blitz? How do
you do it and how do you read the input to it?

Many Thanx :)

Neil

Hi,

After reading the Commodity Problems thread, I realised that you can make
programs into commodities (duh! :) and I was hoping someone could give me a
rundown of how you can use the commodity commands? 

Thanks

Neil

Did you look at the source code to FLAGS, that I attached to that mail?

If not, mail me direct, and I`ll send you a copy - or if you`ve got any
specific questions, let me know - you might also want to take a look at
NCommandSet on Aminet - which has an alternative commodity library to
RICommoditiesLib.

There appears to be a problem with RICommoditiesLib freeing memory, however,
if you want to use it, look at my source for FLAGS, which I`ve attached.
I`ve been using this commodity for a year now, without any problems.

I`ve just downloaded NCommandSet from Aminet, which has got commodity stuff
in it, but I heard recently that there was a bug in it, which is currently
being fixed.  But I will try to write a new version of FLAGS using these
libs instead, when I`ve had a chance to look at them.

Hope this helps.

ATTENTION GARETH THE UPGRADER!

I too am in high spirits, as I`ve just received my EZTower, and A4000
keyboard - hope I am still in high spirits tonight, once I`ve attempted the
installation.

Subject: Commodity problems!

Hi,

I'm having some problems making my program into a commodity and would
appreciate some help.
The MakeCommodity command works ok, but when I try to recieve messages
nothing happens,
everything else works fine though! I couldn't find any examples on how to
use it so I'm only
guessing to how I should use it. BTW, do I need to monitor for all messages
or only those that
I need, *ExchangeKill* for example?
The library used is Reflective Images Commodity Library v0.9.
Here is a small portion of the program:

*If MakeCommodity("Demon","Test","Test2")*
**
*  While running=True*
*    em=ExchangeMessage*
*    If em*
*      If ExchangeKill Then running=False*
*    EndIf*
*    Gosub compare*
*    Gosub readin_volumes*
*    Delay_(100)*
**
*  Wend*
*Else*
*  NPrint"Couldn't create commodity!"*
**
*End If*
*End*
**

Linus

I think some of it was sprites. You can have a sprite in front of the disp=
lay 
and one behind it. Perhaps you can do one in between a dual playfield disp=
lay 
as well, that would give you five.

A playfield really is a whole full-screen layer, not just some little
parallax section taking up a quarter of the screen or even less such
as the waves at the bottom. Possible hardware sprites are involved, I
don't know. From the fact that the worms landscapes are 16 colours
that would seriously suggest that a dual-playfield is in use, with
copper colour-changes performed on the background one to allow a few
sections of the image to move at different speeds, thus creating the
illusion of more parallax layers. I guess some waves are rendered to
the background playfield and some to the foreground, but it's not
especially sophisticated I don't think.

I think it might help to distinguish between parallax and playfield. I
guess the term playfield came from the dual playfield in the custom
hardware, in which two full-screen displays are essentially
independent of each other. In some ways bitplanes are playfields also
I suppose. A level of parallax however can be any height and width
really to just give the impression that things further away move
slower, an early groundbreaking example being Shadow Of the Beast. It
used dual playfields but also many levels of parallax, ie strips of
ground/clouds/mountains moving at different speeds. I wouldn't be
surprised btw if worms uses part of the display library or slice
facility of offsetting each line based on the contents of an array of
differences (read that somewhere in the manual, anway). I'd say worms
uses copperlists cus it doesn't multitask and also because of the
colour limitations caused by a dual playfield (stuff easier done in
blitz mode).

One platform that certainly seemed to do playfields more
often than parallax was the snes, which at times seemed to have 3 or
even 4 full-screen layers. The megadrive had more than one layer quite
a lot although seemed to be keener on shorter parallax layers like in
sonic.

<advert>

Using something like mildred you can do as many playfields as you
like, cpu power permitting, sharing the same palette or perhaps
combined with palette changes vertically if you have a copperlist too,
cus generally you do a full-screen blit of the background every frame.
In a little comedy shootemup I started working on recently using
Mildred I have a thin strip of foreground parallax, about 50 rows of
independently parallaxed ground (like streetfighter sorta thing), a
thick strip of parallax sort of in the middle, then the sky is a
background layer with parallaxed stars and stuff on top. Then on top
of all of this there are various objects blitted. It's just a single
256-colour screen but the background is made of 128 colours at the
moment with 128 left for the foreground shapes. So you could say that
it is a double playfield with parallax, at least that's how i'd
describe it, at the moment, although i might add more layers.

Not really. The game itself is made in assembler but the copy-protection
is written in AMOS.

  Or an 040 with a BVision maybe, as it has very /fast/ access to Fast
Ram. Can anyone with that setup here tell us the results?

  Anyway, both your programs look very nice! :-)

Dude, it kicks ass. Get Blittersoft to release it!

Did you use DisplayScroll for them, thats like the effect I was going for =

Yeah, the floor is cool.

Wow, something like this would be perfect for the game I'm working on. Do you
think it would be possible to achieve a similar frame rate in Amiga mode
using Mildred?

Mind if i answer that? well, here's my 10p worth.

Erm, probably you could just about achieve what his nifty little AGA
program does, using Mildred on an 040/25 at 25fps. You won't get that
sort of thing running at 50ps on anything but the highest end (060 and
fast gfx-card).

You'd need three individual MScrolls, one for each of the
per-row-modified areas (sky, water and ground). Some MBlockScrolls for
the static mountains and any other non-updated areas. Then you'd need
to do some kind of tile update of the backdrop (the wall, houses,
whatever but maybe you wont have the water?), which may involved
masked and unmasked blits/scrolls. Then finally any time left you can
use to draw moving objects. Note that anything you draw in this way
can be animated cus it will be fully updated every frame so might as
well! You'd be lucky to get that running at 25fps on an 040/25 but it
might be just about doable, and lets not forget its in 256 colours.

I'm working on a little thing at the moment which is sort of growing
on its own. Its gunna be some kind of a shootemup eventually. It's
based on a sort of `defender' approach, ie 7 or 8 screens of game area
which wraps around, although it might not have much to do with
defender when it comes to how the game plays. Here's how I construct
the display so far (using Mildred).

A display of 320x240 is set up in the usual sort of way, only for AGA
output at the moment, and various bits of graphics loaded in, palettes
combined, etc. Then I start to draw a frame. The top 150 rows of the
display are MBlockScrolled from an image of some nebulae or a planet,
something like that, which at the moment is using about 64 colours.
This doesn't scroll at the moment but might at some point scroll
and/or animate or be split into strips. On top of this area are about
100 single-pixel stars which look more like space debris from a
distance depending on the background image.

Then an area of about 320x32 is drawn as a rainbow of 32 colours, like
a copperlist rainbow only in software. On top of this is the scanner,
which is overall 1/7th the size of the 7 screens (2240/7=320). On top
of this are rendered a realtime zoomed down version of every object in
the game area (wether they are in the visible area or not), so there
might be for example 25 16x8 objects realtime zoomed, which isnt
really much different to if they were just blitted from small images.
So that shows where the baddies are, and there are 128 colours taken
up by the baddies and the player and weapons at the moment.

Then there are 47 rows of ground that has a different scroll speed for
each row, which is just one MScroll using a custom offsets list, the
image taken from a pre-perspective-zoomed 2240x47 image of some ground
or whatever. The bottom of the game are is 13 pixels from the bottom
of the screen, so the remaining area is another strip of land (a
single MScroll without parallax but that scrolls) on top of which is a
mask-scrolled image of the player info, icons, score, etc.

Once all that lark is done the rest of the time is mostly spent
checking wether any baddies are flying past the screen and if so blit
them. The 16x8 (ish) sized images in the scanner i mentioned earlier
come from the 25 128x64 256-colour objects that I have active at the
moment in my test. I can have about 6 or 7 of these objects on-screen
at once before the whole thing will start dropping below 25fps (on my
040/25). Erm, I think that if you have 320x200 instead, btw, you
gain about 4fps.

The engine also currently handles the player input to fly around
(although he will be a character with some kind of rocket boots or
jetpack, not a spaceship) and draws the character, which is in no way
animated yet. There is also no collision detection, enemy AI, bullets,
sound, or updating of the score/icons. But it does all run at 25fps at
the moment on my system and looks quite impressive really because I
know you wouldn't be able to have this running in that many colours
using copperlists and AGA. A dual playfield would certainly do it a
grand misservice even with colour changes. Also because the objects
are blitted in fastram it means that adding more objects slows the
engine down much less quickly than if you were doing that with the
blitter or whatever to chip ram, so even 10-12 128x64 objects can be
onscreen at about 20fps still.

I guess if you wanted parallax sky then it would take a little bit
more, maybe nock another frame-per-second or two off. Also by
refreshing everything on the display every frame it can be animated
with little extra cost (changing the shape number doesn't take much
time). I've only got coke-cans bouncing around at the moment, hehe, so
they don't animate much.

Erm, if you wanted to have some kind of `house' or various buildings
in the mid-ground, inbetween the backdrop and the moving objects, i
guess you will have to take time away from how many objects you can
have. If your imagery takes up, say, half the screen with a few taller
bits here and there then you might have enough time for, say, about 2
128x64 sort of objects moving around? or indeed more numerous smaller
objects (thats based on something like a 320x120 mid-ground area,
which again could be animated).

So maybe this gives you some sort of idea. You wont get it working
decent on an 030/50 but what you want to do might just about work on
an 040/25, maybe assited a bit by a smaller screen height? It also
might be a little bit faster than I've suggested cus i have that
complicated scanner bit in the middle.
