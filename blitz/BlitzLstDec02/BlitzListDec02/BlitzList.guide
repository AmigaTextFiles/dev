						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Subject: @{b}1 in compile runtime and 1 independent. boombangabang?@{ub}



today I "compile and run"'d a prog.
then, while this was running,
I ran a created executable.

no problems this far,
they work togheter.

but then I quit the ran executable,
and my mouse started jerking. (060)
when I turned to the "compile and run"'d prog,
I realized that it did not react to
my input at all.
I tried to stop the debugger to see
if it was in an endless loop or something,
but the debugger did not respond either.

then I reset to get the problem away.

I use amiblitz 2.27b3
I use reddebugger 2.51b1
and the executable was created with an old version of
amiblitz2 or maybe even original blitz2.
I think the executable was compiled without debugger.

is this problem common and unavoidable?

On 05.12.02, you wrote:

I look in code and see that the debuglib.bb set the 68ktraps direct.So all
tasks use this as long as another task overwritten.Thats no AmigaOS
Multitasking friendly way 

So the trapcode is changed if you start another program with
runtimecheck on.Normaly this is bad for diffrent programs but no problem
because runtime trap code is
always same on bb2 only the compiler use diffrent code 

This mean that you cannot run together 1 program with runtimecheck
on and use the compiler with runtimecheck on

I hope i can fix it when use exec 
alloctrap multitask friendly Function
to set the trap vectors individuel by task.

And AB2 i must try to change that it use diffrent traps because old programs
can still fail

Best is use ab2fdconvert here.It knows reserved AB2 optimizer numbers and
check for libs in blitz2:userlibs/beta too

ab2fdconvert store convertet files in blitz2:userlibs/beta
So you need not build a new deflibs only choose reload all libs or restart
AB2 or BB2 

Also you can replace the deflibs files without loose of your convertet fd's

BTW: Does someone know a provider that offer free ftp space so i can hold a
dir for AB2 to put all files in.

I know it work with webspace provider if there is no index.html but i hear
that they close the site if there is no index.html soon 

Making a homepage i am too lazy and i have no knowledge...

@NODE "mail_5" " Absolute timing "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 12-14-02 23:54:21
Subject: @{b}Absolute timing@{ub}

Hi there,

I've almost finished a program that relies on  on executing the main loop
exactly each second. At the moment, I'm using the following code to ensure that
this happens (as close as is reasonably possible):-

#Repeat#
##
#.....Main loop goes here#
##
#  tim.l=Timer#
#  If tim<50 Then del=50-tim Else del=0#
#  Delay_ del#
#  ResetTimer#
##
#Forever#

However, I'm told that ResetTimer can cause problems with other programs in the
system (tho' I personally haven't found any yet), and so in a bid to avoid
this, I'm trying the following:-

#Repeat#
##
#....Main loop goes here#
##
#  oldtim.l=tim:tim.l=Timer#
#  If tim-oldtim <50#
#    If tim-oldtim>0#
#      del.l=50-(tim-oldtim)#
#    Else#
#      oldtim=tim#
#      del=0#
#    EndIf#
#  Else#
#    oldtim=tim#
#    del=50#
#  EndIf#
#  Delay_(del)#
##
#Forever#

But it doesn't work. Every 2nd loop produces a difference between oldtim and tim
of > 50 (which it shouldn't, the main loop executes in well under a second)
thus meaning I get a 1 second delay, immediately followed by no delay. I've
tried a variety of variation on the code, including compressing it to 2 lines
(doing the same job) with no difference. A test using just the timing code in
the loop and outputting values to CON: has the same fault, when in fact the
code itself executes in about 3 - 4 cycles. So what's up with it. It's driving
me nuts :o(

BTW - the test for <0 is for when timer loops back from a positive to a negative
number (32768 cycles)

All the best



Steve

@NODE "mail_6" " Re: Absolute timing "
From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>
Date: 12-15-02 00:29:27
Subject: @{b}Re: Absolute timing@{ub}

Do it like this:

_________________________________Snip!
repeat:
starttime.l = Timer

.... Your code ...

waittime.l = Max(Min(starttime + 50 - Timer,50),0)
Delay_ waittime
Forever
_________________________________Snip!


This is safe if the Ticks overflow (which ocures about
after one year uptime ;-) and calls never delay_ with
negative value (i am not sure if this is matters).

BTW: This is no very accurate timing because you might
get errors about 1 VBlank and the VBlank is not the same
on every machine (50Hz Pal Amigas, 60HZ NTSC or
more on VGA Display). This will also cause trouble on Amithlon
where the VBlank is not constant when you cause IDCMP Events.

You could use the vvblank.inlcude from my homepage
(http://www.hd-rec.de/index.php?site=developer).
There is a "sync" mode that remembers the last call
of the vvblank_wait() command and is always
exact 1 second.

Ciao,

Thilo

Try this, it`s from statfuncs, found on aminet. Using timer device has the added 
benefit you don`t need to care about ntsc, or pal or whatever.

;-----------------------------------------------------------------

; Function : TimerWait { seconds, microseconds }

; Author : taken from Andrea Doimo's BlitzFAQ website...
;          - various authors contributed, so unknown...

; Sets up the timer.device to wait for set amount of
; time in seconds and microseconds (1/1,000,000 secs).

; So a half-second wait would be TimerWait {0,500000},
; 1.2 seconds would be TimerWait {1,200000}, etc.

; Returned values :

; 0 = No error
; 1 = Failed to open timer.device
; 2 = Failed to open message port
; 3 = Failed to create a timer request

; There's not much you can do if it fails, so just
; use ** If TimerWait {s,m}=0 Then Print "Fail" **
; or ** dummy.b=TimerWait {s,m} ** or whatever.

; I don't think much can fail though.

Function.b TimerWait {sec.l, mic.l}

*TimerMP.MsgPort = CreateMsgPort_()
If *TimerMP
  *TimerIO.timerequest = CreateIORequest_ (*TimerMP,SizeOf .timerequest)

Are there any playroutines that give possibility to check for an event in

Yes I believe that is the one I am using, but my version is for sure older 
than the 2002-version on aminet.  I'll give it a try, hope they have fixed 
the a4000/040 bug! Thanx!

Hello 

I have add code now to allow tooltype classiccolor=Pennum
to highlight Chipset commands in instructionhelper.

To do not too much work i add this datas in ped

As far i know this lib work only with chipset

                 Dc.w 11  ;Ricopperfxlib.obj
                 Dc.w 45  ;Risoundlib.obj

                 Dc.w 209 ;thxplay.library1
                 Dc.w 96  ;#trackerlib

Does someone know additional libs that need chipset ?
If so please add it to mail

Note:

The code check only for libs not for single instructions so 
shapelib is part useable and not highlight

I think the problem with the SerComment_ command is that it required two strings to be 
passed. IIRC Blitz always had problems passing multiple strings from the temporary string 
buffer to functions (both strings were passed as the same pointer).

Speaking of... When I tried to enter:
/ --> Setcomment_ "Ram:test","BlitzComment" <--/

BlitzBasic 2.10 would ask for 'volume 2' something and then crash the
running program. AmiBlitz would just pretend everything was ok if I
used the following setup(?):

/If SetComment_ ("Ram:test","BlitzComment")/
/NPrint "Everything ok?"/
/  Else/
/NPrint "Something went wrong..."/
/Endif/

Result: Everythin ok?

Perhaps it is supposed to be that way?

Thanks :)

Yes all should work now ok.
You can also use like this

Function.s test{c$}
c$=c$+"012"
Function Return c$
End Function

a$="123"
If SetComment_ ("test",a$+"456"+test{"789"})

I cannot remember how you do it with the Blitz commands, 
but you can use:

ClearPointer_ Addr Window(window_number)

Well it was not me that changed the pointer in a game :)

The easiest way is to have your game running in a window and then use the SetPointer 
command. I think that is the name of the command anyway.

I have a window in the gamescreen,
and use wpointer <shape>

but if you don't have a window
you could be real cruel,
and make a pointer.prefs
file and copy it to ram:env/sys/pointer.prefs
(afaik, this is dangerous on unormal systems)
 if you consider doing that bad thing,
then you should also backup
the file before overwriting it,
and copy it back before
you end your program.
 I have done this in DroidWars3 on aminet,
and works fine. (to me)

Aaaarrrggghhhh!!!! NNNNOOOOO!!!!

Never use "ram:env/sys/pointer.prefs" always use "env:sys/pointer.prefs"
if you must do it this way.

Anyone using happyenv, env-handler or simillar WON'T have env: in ram:
in the best case the pointer just wont change, in the worst your program
will fail because it's trying to backup/write a file in a directory that doesn't 
exist :(

Subject: @{b}Lamer needs help please(that is me)...@{ub}


I got a problem, and it's killing me simply because I've been working on it
forever without any progress...

What I wish to do is, to make AmiBlitz set a comment om a target file:
And I tried the following command:

--> SetComment_ "ram:test","BlitzComment"

The veird thing is, nothings happening to the file!!! No comment is set! Not even an error
message or anything. However if i try out these two commands, they will work
perfectly fine:

--> DeleteFile_ "ram:test"
--> Delay_ 100

Can someone please help me?
1. How can I edit the comment on a file?
2. How can I read the comment on a file?
3. How can I ask the filesystem for the maximum supported comment lenght?

Any help would be welcome :)

That`s not how you should do it. Most amiga os api functions require a string pointer 
as argument(if they want a string), aka STRPTR. So do this:

string1$=ram:test"
string2$="BlitzComment"
SetComment_ &string1$,&string2$

The "&" gives the address of the string variable.

Hi boys,
i need a routine for my program to analyse all possible ID3 tags of an MP3. 
This includes ID3v1, v2, v2.1, v2.2, v2.3! Later i need a routine to analyse
MP3 up to ID3v4 and OGG headers too....

The routine should work as follow... Reading header of MP3, analyse of what
version
it is (ID3 version x.x or OGG i.e), then Case/Select to the correct
code/routine to read all datas out of the MP3 and write this to a structure...

It would be the biggest xmas present for me, if someone can help me with a
complete
working and maybe good documented source as .asc file, due fact i have some
own and modified blitz libs!

Many thanks in advance!

There`s an MP3 Tag library on aminet that you can use with Blitz, although 
you gotta convert it with fdconvert ( or the newer newfdconvert!).

I used it a while back, but I haven`t had much time lately to program in 
Blitz, and my poor A4000 is in bits waiting to be retowered ! ( Yes Steve, I 
haven`t forgotten those MUI list hook examples!)

As for OGG headers, I got no idea.. the ogg format is freely available to 
roll your own though.

Good luck, and Merry Xmas to you guys.

Subject: @{b}Need help (search a good example)@{ub}

Hello,

I'm new with blitz and need to learn lots of things (basic, how amiga work,
etc...) and maybe my mistake is to want to found all alone and maybe I
couldn't be the good programmer I could imagine when I began to try. ;-)


Maybe for me is to found the 2-3 best examples for using directly with last
amiblitz version. 

I'm searching a simple program in blitz mode (for example a gui program for
cli based only program). I'm searching a well programmed program with
tooltype, prefs saved, localization, menu, exchange compatible,.......


If someone know the best example I can found in aminet or in a personnal
internet site to help me to understand the basis things with amiblitz, that
could help me a lot.

thanks in advance.

With exchange compatible you mean commodity ?
Attached is the winuaeclip utility.

It is a commodity that set via tooltype hotkeys for cut copy paste clipboard
and
allow tranfer to winuae (the jsr $f0ffc0 do this)
It is small and show both technics 


For other tooltype example try this:

You can use the helpfeature of AB2.

Press helpkey with no char under cursor.

The instructionhelper opens and you can type tool in the
stringgadget.Doubleclick on intresting function

Now you get the onlineguide of the command for ritooltypeslib

To see all commands in this lib press the content button of the amigaguide
Now you see also a button example

Click it and click load example to load it in ped.
Now you see a program that do lots of tooltype stuff.

Thats the way you can do

Type a functionname you guess in instructionhelper and look what functions
you find.

Some functions (all from rixxxx libs) have example progs
 
The bad side of this of course is that most commands have no example prog
for it.
But AB2 support easy creating guides and examples for it.

Blackbird for example have now port the free Aminet dev docu of CGX in AB2
helpstyle which is attached

Subject: @{b}New AB2.27b3@{ub}

Hi, All

That should  give the final release of AB2.27 
Please report problems you found,questions about new features....
Intresting features are maybe 

3 window configs can save F4 F5 F6 choose them
Dialogparameter with CTRL+HELP work finaly (i hope)
pressing help over \ show contents of typeentry from the var   
Tooltype standardeditmode let you choose standard edit like other editors 

Knownlimits:  "öäü" after ; drop chars >128
      2.27b3

      syntax 2 fix Tony Rolfe report  *account account give errors

      object adress calculations work with 32 bit instead of 16 bit
      A maximum of 32000 Objects can now be used

      !screen_width !screen_height !screen_depth !screen_id macros add
      to get the dimensions of a Screen opened with !screen_

      The screenwidth commands of elmorefunclib i not recommend to use
      to get screen dimensions because intuition delay sometimes updating
      this short after a screen is open so this macros are add

.News 2.27b3:
   Press help after \ or over \ open typehelper and show type
   Work also with usepath (\content)and arrays.
   Limits: if you have lokal and global var with same name but diffrent
types
           the local type is choose
   Only help here is avoid same varname in local global with diffrent type

   screen_ macro support also Tags add in all.res
   version macro add to all.res
   Optional Function Parameter need a @ before the var this make it safer
   (if you not notice the warning you get random effects in C
   i search long in winuae for such a bug)
   All vars later are optional
   Missed parameter values are set to -1
   Thanks Thilo for Idea

   For ex.
   statement test{par1,@par2,par3}
   if par2=-1 then par2=........  .Do this for handle it.
   .....
   Setting

   Calling
   test{}       give error not enough parameter
   test{10}     ok par1=10 par2 and par3 have value -1
   test{10,20}  ok par2 have value 20 and par3 =-1


   Added window settings at F4 F5 F6.To store settings press lamiga+F4
/F5/F6
   The current active window is then the window where the string is activate
   after recall a setting
   Note: No string gad should be activate for now to save and recall
settings
   To see if store is correct the windows do short close and reopen
   To save settings to file you need choose prefs and click on save.
   After start from ped always config F4 is load

       Clash in resident show now in windowtitle what clash
       Instruction object and end object add
       See online guide for this
       You can insert Instruction Pars in a dialog.Press CTRL+HELP
       for this.If the win is open you can click also on the instruction
       to show the pars in the dialog.Add Code add the code or modify it if
       there was code after instruction

       Better comment display and chars after ;:@ is not draw as a comment

       Added ped hotkeys:
     
       lamiga+a jump to last position where you add chars
       lamiga+shift+1/2/3 save local bookmark
       lamiga+1/2/3 jump to local bookmark

       Tooltype standardeditmode change return key to standard
       (return split line)
       backspace on first column do a join line
       Pressing del on a marked block clear the block and do a displaybeep
warning


       You can use upto 5 FPU registervars do it with regload var1 var2.
       which increase speed on your Code.fpu load/store convert always
single
       to extend this give you a speed boost on all Systems
       If vars are changed when they are on register do a regsave.
       It store all register to memory.

      strings can cast to longs(char num cannot be greater than typesize)
      compare work with byte word long and float
       in newsyntax mode

    Example:
      x.l=@"ILBM":if x=@"CMAP" then .....:if a.w=@"ab"
      Give lot speed instead of using asc(x)

      Added AB2fdconvert
      enhanced bb2convert that handle reserved AB2 numbers correct
      and also scan
      blitz:userlibs/beta dir for existing libs to get no clashes

      ; Highlight fix highlight now at first ;

      \\char add char with hexbyte to a string in newsyntaxmode (optimize 4)
      You must write always both chars (ex: \\0a for 0xa)
      print "\\22 Hello \\22"  print the text " Hello "
      If you want print \\ you need write \\\\ 4 backslashs

      \\R05char repeat char 5 times print "\\R09*Hello" print"*********
Hello"

      Tooltype STARTDIR add.You can choose a default directory now for
startup

      Does now automatic switch to nontoken Mode so you can
      edit .guide and .txt Files in ped.Try the amiblitz History it have
some bookmarks set
Note: if you maybe get wrong mode (nothing is impossible)
      go to preferences and set the tokenmode manuel (no data lost possible)
      If you totally unhappy with this feature
      Tooltype no_auto_tokenize can set

Ped can now handle editpad/YAM Clipboard data

writetype/readtype command add to load/save a complete Type

     Use only with this compiler Version or you get runtime errors

     stop commands are ignored in release builds

     No error no crash now
debug of extern programs
     Type DEBUG as first command in your programm and you can debug
     it when you have a plugin or start from WB or cli
     Notes: dont let such a program reach a stop when ped is not run
            Also the source of this program must be visible in ped
            or you see no (wrong Source) in reddebug

BTW:  Ped(AMiblitz) can now debug since this version with reddebug

From: Thilo Köhler <koehlerthilo@...>

Subject: @{b}OOT: DVD Player with SECAM !?@{ub}

Hi all!

Hope you wont kill me for this out-of-topic question
but I can not solve this from internet research.

Is there anybody from Poland listening ?

I have a DVD Player bought in Germany and want to
use it in Poland. Is this possible ? I read somewhere
Poland has SECAM, Germany has PAL Video. But then
I read Poland has PAL too, or at least has TVs supporting
both.
If I use Scart cable or RGB is it still important which format
the video output has (SECAM/PAL) ? Or is this just important
for signals from antenna ?
Or do DVD Players usualy support both ?
(nearly all players support NTSC)

Thanks for any hints,

Thilo

If you use RGB or Composite then it shouldn't matter.

PAL / NTSC / SECAM are just different ways the signal is sent
over the airways. most TV's scart sockets will be fine, if you do
get one of the dodgy ones, use a VCR as a converter :)

Well... if you want a NTSC-videotape to be played by a PAL videoplayer,
you have to convert the format before. Though, nowadays, most players
can support both the formats. So I have to say, it isn't just a matter
of how to spread the signal on air. PAL format has more lines and a
different vertical frequency.

For Thilo: I think there is no problem, as most TV-sets should support
PAL and SECAM, mine (a rather old Italian one) does, for example.

Ok, this seems to work nicely but is not exactly what I meant. Because now if I 
select the block starting at the first character and copy and paste it it will all 
end up aligned under the cursor. What imo should happen is that it will have the same 
tab/space alignment as the original block with relation to where the cursor is at 
that moment. Example:

  repeat
    blah
    blop
    crap
  until 0

Select and copy the whole text starting at the "r", then paste it starting here:

      .<--- Cursor there(6 spaces)

It will end up like this:

      repeat
      blah
      blop
      crap
      until 0

But it should imo be like this:

      repeat
        blah
        blop
        crap
      until 0

Subject: @{b}Some bugs/issues@{ub}

I found some issues/bugs with amiblitz and its editor. 

If there`s a "!" in a comment line, the stuff after the "!" will change colour to what 
the colour of macros is.

I sometimes get lots of returns in between blocks of text i copied and pasted, it`s 
been happening since I don`t know how long ;-) Hard to reproduce though. It`s not 
visible when you actually do it, but it`s there when you load the source again later. 
So initially you just have the normal one return or whatever you want and then a whole 
lot more, like the size of the pasted block.

Like this:

command
blah
hell didly ding dong crap
<return here>
i have
just been
pasted

Saved and then reloaded:

command
blah
hell didly ding dong crap
<many returns here>



i have
just been
pasted


Annoyance, since original blitz, is that if I copy a text which is differently outlined 
than where I want to paste it, only the first line pasted ends up at the right place 
and the rest ends up at the original outlined(tabbed) place.

Can you send me your amiblitz2.info ?.
and ped.prefs
Maybe you use diffrent color settings than i 
I test with following code

    ;        !screen_     xxxxxx
With my config all after ; is draw with background pen 0 foreground pen 1

Seem bug from old superted.I see this too sometimes but to fix it i need to
reproduce it so i can debug it.

Sure i know is that this must happen while save    

That it happen after copy and paste i found not out and is maybe a good tip
to reproduce this problem more often.But for now playing with it i see no
problem

I have no idea how this can happen.

All lines are collect in a linked list
Ted do on save only go through the list of lines and store to file.

I found it a good idea doing this in that way because i dont like Golded
Editpad paste behavior because most time the indent is diffrent to what i
really want 

Golded4.7.2/Editpad do this so that the block is always paste in column
where it
cut when more lines used
Ped Bug (Feature)here is that first line is paste where cursor stand

If someone want a tooltype to set paste behavior to old let me know i think
the way amorel suggest is the best in praxis

Yeah, hard to reproduce, I`ll look into it more though.

Greetings,

I'm using the following:

  Window 1,win1l,win1t,win1w,win1h,$100,"",0,0
    *win1.l = Peek.l(Addr Window(1))
    rp1.l=RastPort(1)
    WindowToFront_ *win1

to make the window open in front of all others on workbench unfortunately it doesn't work :(

HELP!!!!

Cheers

Just try:
  Window 1,win1l,win1t,win1w,win1h,$100,"",0,0
  WindowToFront_ Peek.l(Addr Window(1))

I am not sure if using *win.l is a good idea. The above code
should work. I usually it like this:

  Window 1,win1l,win1t,win1w,win1h,$100,"",0,0
  *win1._Window = Peek.l(Addr Window(1))
   rp1._RastPort=*win1\RPort
   WindowToFront_ *win1

Hope this helps.

Ciao,

Thilo

Tried it before, doesn't work :(

using *win1.Window (amigalibsIII.res) doesn't work either :(

and 'rp1.RastPort=*win1\RPort' comes up with 'Can't assign expression' :(
but rp1.l=*win1\RPort works...

This must work, I use exactly this in my own proggies.

Try this:

Window 1,win1l,win1t,win1w,win1h,$100,"",0,0
If Peek.l(Addr Window(1))><0
  WindowToFront_ Peek.l(Addr Window(1))
Else
  ... something went wrong
End If

to ensure that the window was opened.

OK, sorry, it has to be

*rp1._RastPort = *win1\RPort

This should work. Make sure that your Emailer is displaying
the "*" correctly, if not copy&paste it into Edit.

Ciao,

BACKDROP        $0100   This opens the window behind any other window that
is      
This define your window as a backdrop window so it stay always on back

A reason to use the constants instead of numbers?

BTW, the "can't assign expression" error you got from Thilo's tip was because 
there was no * in front of 'rp1.RastPort=...'. The code was trying to assign a 
value to a structured variable, not a pointer.
