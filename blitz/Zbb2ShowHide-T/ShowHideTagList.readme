This is the classical MUI ShowHide example... but in Blitz2.

Based on the example ShowHide.c by Stefan Stuntz
Adapted in Blitz Basic 2 by Erwan Fouret
Rewritten by Benoit Socias using TagLists and MUI BB2 libraries.

You need to those libraries in your Blitz2:deflibs if you want to
compile this program.
