Uploader: vision_fx@citenet.net
Author  : Roger Beausoleil
Type    : dev/basic

  BOOPSI support functions as always been written for C, not

  Now, Blitz users will be able to make BOOPSi gadgets, and more
  with those missing commands from the Amiga_Lib.

  This is a GIFTWARE! Use it!
 

  Some examples will follow on aminet soon!
