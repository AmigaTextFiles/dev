  Boopsi support commands were always missing since the first release of
  Blitz by Acid Software, surely because they were written for C, not for
  High Level Language like Blitz. But, as all Blitzer already know... BLITZ
  is a very powerful language and everything can can be done with it!
  ...if you have the commands for it too! :))) 

  Now, BlitzBasic can use the Boopsi functions as in C!  

  What that mean? The addition of those commands will allow users to make Objets
  Oriented Programming (OOP). Blitz users can now use BOOPSI gadgets and DataTypes
  in their own programs! 

  You can look in the autodocs for further informations. Everything was written
  as the Autodocs specifications.

  Enjoy this New Library... It's a GiftWare from @{" Roger Beausoleil " link Author }.
