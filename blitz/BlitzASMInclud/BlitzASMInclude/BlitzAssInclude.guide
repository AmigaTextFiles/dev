  @{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

    BlitzASMInclude is only an include file that  you  may  use  with  your  favorite
    assembler (e.g. PhxAss).

    This file is a set of macros and constants converted from Blitz one's.  By  using
    this include and an assembler you will be able to write libraries of commands for
    your lovely BlitzBasic.

    I decided to write it because BlitzBasic assembler is very poor,  not  optimized,
    does  not  support  other  processors  than  the  68000, doesn't know about local
    labels... BlitzBasic is not PhxAss ;-)

    This package is  If_you_don't_send_me_something_I_will_kill_the_cat_ware  If  you
    find  it  useful  (sure you will :-), try to send me what you want to my address.
    Therefore, it's freely distribuable so spread it like you want !

    I'm looking for:
      - Keyfiles of your own program
      - Björk stuff
      - Absolutely Fabulous and Friends videos
      - Cookies
      - Old games (Amiga, MegaDrive, SNes, GameBoy and N64 ;-)
      - Post cards.
      - Chocolate.
      - Various CDs.
      - Money 8-)
      - Something made by you... (a picture, a program, a cake...)

  @{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

    Installation is very complex ;-), all you have to is to copy @{b}blitz.i@{ub} file to  you
    include directory (e.g. Include:)

    Don't forget to @{i}Include@{ui} it in your source...

    A good compiler ;-) Try PhxAss by Frank Wille (frank@phoenix.owl.de)

@Node 04 "BlitzASMInclude : Usage"

  @{b}@{u}Usage@{ub}@{uu}

    Using macros is more easy than BlitzBasic ;-) :

    Blitz :
        !libheader  {198,0,0,0,0}

        !function   {#long}
            !args   {#long,#byte}
            !libs
            !subs   {_Token,0,0}
        !name       {"Token","(Long,Byte) - Do things ;-)"}

        !libfin

    ASM :
        libheader   198,0,0,0,0

        function    long
            args    long,byte
            libs
            subs    _Token
        name        'Token','(Long,Byte) - Do things ;-)'

    I rather prefer ASM typing ;-)

  @{b}@{u}Note@{ub}@{uu}

    @{i}repargs@{ui} macro has been renamed as @{i}repa@{ui}... you can change it if  you  want  to.  I
    made it only for design reasons ;-)

  @{b}@{uu}Invoking@{ub}@{uu}

    Invoking Blitz system function is easy, because token values are allways the same
    (e.g.  $CF01 to alloc a string).. but to invoke users command is more complicated
    has you need to know the token's  value...  You  will  have  to  investigate  for
    this...

    All the way, invoking users tokens is dangerous, because someone (like me ;-) may
    have changed its libraries numbers, and so token's values are no longer good.

    But if you want to allocate some memory, string... It is very easy..

      o You can use ALibJsr.. as usual

        MOVE.L  #Size,D0
        MOVE.L  #Flags,D1
        ALibJsr Blitz_AllocMem

        MOVE.L  D0,A1
        MOVE.L  #Size,D0
        ALibJsr Blitz_FreeMem

      o You can also use my custom macros...

        BAllocMem #Size,#Flags
        BFreeMem  D0,#Size

  @{b}@{u}Examples@{ub}@{uu}

     You are very lucky, I have included 2 examples... These libraries  are  mine,  I
     had spend lot of time (;-) writing them... So if you use some code, give me some
     credits.. thanks ;-)

       @{" LotanSystem.a " link Src/LotanSystem.a/Main}
       @{" LotanArgs.a   " link Src/LotanArgs.a/Main}

     These libraries are very basic, but very powerful. I have  written  a  dozen  of
     libraries  for  everything (strings, words, intuition, arrays...), you will find
     them on aminet under LotanLibs.lha. In fact I don't use any others ;-)...

    If you have any problem while installing/using this set , if you found some bugs,
    if you wanna add some functions, give me your PPC board, invit me to dinner...
