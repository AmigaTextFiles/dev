@node "Intro" "What is it for?"


  Blitz Private Investigator3 - we'll just call it I3 from now on ;)
  is simply a little tool that will read through a tokenized Blitz 
  source code and give you a listing of what libraries were used
  and how many times each command was used. 

  In addition, it will recurse into any INCLUDE or XINCLUDE files
  and will cross reference the commands to the line number within
  each source file.

  What is it for?  It is intended for program optimizing - If you
  find that you have used only one or two commands from a particular
  library, you can shrink your exec's size by finding a way to
  eliminate the command(s) - by using different commands, or better
  yet by learning how to do it using the OS functions.

  FEATURES:

  * Runs from WorkBench
  * Customizes itself to your particular Blitz set-up
  * Source included
  * It can also give you a list of the free library numbers
  * PD!  Do what you like with it.

  REQUIRES:

  ReqTools  (It will crash otherwise!)

  KingCON is also recommended, but not required

@node "dist" "What kind of "


  Blitz Private Investigator3 is PD.

  That's a word you don't see very often, eh?  And no, I don't
  mean "copyrighted PD", I mean simply "Public Domain" -
  no strings, do whatever you like with it.

  Reverse-engineer it, hack it to shreds in your hex editor -
  have fun with it.  (Yeah, the source IS included, but you could
  delete it and pretend there wasn't one)

  Stick your name on it and impress your girlfriend or whatever..
  
  NOTE: If THAT impresses your girlfriend, you need to find a new
  girlfriend   ;)

  If you make any improvements, I'd appreciate a copy - so I can stick
  MY name on it and impress MY girlfriend  ;)

@node "use" "What do I do?"

 Well, it's pretty self-explanatory, but I needed to fill some space
 in this Guide, so:

 Installation:

 * Just put the whole drawer somewhere
   If you don't want the source, it's OK to delete it, as
   well as the ".xtra" file that goes with it, and the
   "gad.shps" file as well...


 Usage:

 * Double Click the Icon -

 -> If you have ReqTools:

   You will see a control panel with some gadgets and an output
   window just below.

   * The first time you run it, click on the "Scan Libs" button.
     You should also do this whenever you add new libraries, or
     otherwise change your Blitz library setup, or acidlibs.
   
     The program will look through your Blitz libraries, make a
     datalist file with all the library numbers and commands.  It
     will also report any duplicate library numbers encountered.
     This list will be saved into the "Investigator" directory.
     You can, of course, use this list for other things.  It is
     a standard ascii text file.

     It's interesting to have a look at this file in a text reader.
     I bet you find a few commands you didn't know you had  ;)

   * Now you are ready to investigate a tokenized Blitz source.
     Click the "Scan Source" button - you will get a file requester
     asking for the name of the source to scan.  Once you have
     selected one, you get a second file requester, asking where to
     save the investigation report.  The default is to save it back
     in the same place as the source, with ".RPT" tacked on the end.
     If you select "Cancel", no report will be saved to disk, but the
     results will be shown in the window.

     If you request a report to disk, you will then get a third requester.
     This asks for a directory to store two temporary files.  The default
     location is T:
     These files are used to create the full cross reference.   If you
     cancel this requester, only a simple count of commands will be
     produced.

     NOTE.   It takes significantly longer to produce a full cross
     reference.   Up to six times as long.   This is because it is
     writing a record for each token encountered.   You may wish to
     do a simple report first - particularly with big sources.

     The full cross reference is only saved to disk.   The on-screen
     report is the same for both options.

     - To cancel a report before it is finished, click on the "Inspector"
     button.
    
     - You can also click the "Inspector" gadget when it is "at rest"
     (plain background) to see the "About" information.


   * You can also get a listing of the available unused library numbers
     on your system by clicking the "Lib #'s" button. 

 -> Oh, and if you DON'T have ReqTools, you will most likely get a nice
    black screen with a flashing red box - but EVERYBODY has ReqTools by
    now, don't they?

@node "bugs" "Bugs  :("

  No, it's not perfect...

  What did you expect for free  ;)

  The problem:

    Some libraries (mostly in the acidlibs file) return the wrong
    command numbers.

    I'm hoping this is due to some obvious mistake I've made in my
    code, which I'm sure you'll point out to me...

    Anyway, I've "fixed" it by patching the library reading routine
    to throw in some extra command names where needed.

    This works with my version of Acidlibs  (the latest one), but I
    have no idea if it will work with any other versions.

    The bug will show up as some wrong command names being shown in
    the report.

  Also:

    In spite of the purpose of the program, I haven't used it on 
    itself yet  ;)

    In other words, it isn't optimized.  I was hoping to work out
    that token-reading bit first.
@endnode

@node "thanks" "My hat's off to:"

 I'd like to take a moment to thank:

 Curt Esser       for the original code (about 90% of this program
                  is his code)

 He, in turn, thanked the following:

 Paul Burkey      for the original idea for this program

 Toby Zuijdveld   help with the token-reading stuff

 Sami N‰‰t‰nen    help with the token reading stuff

 Carl Read        help with the token reading stuff

 James Boyd       program path reading functions,
                  general advice, and bug-testing

 Steve Matty      for explaining how to use a CON: window
                  for program output

 And, in general, everybody on the Blitz-list
