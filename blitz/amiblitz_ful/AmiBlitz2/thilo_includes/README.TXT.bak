This is the port of the Includefiles from Thilo Köhler's includefiles
to the AB2 Object Format to allow handling like real Blitz librarys
with online Help screenhelp Instructionbrowser dialogsupport

Take a look on the source to see how it work.
If you make changes please send them back to Thilo so he can merge
this in the offical source to avoid multiple Versions.

Most sources have a Constant #ownrun=x

If set to 1 it run as a standalone File so you need not build a .res to
modify and test changes
Most includes also have near end of file a example which can run too
when #ownrun=1

If you dont like the use of .res file you can of course use this Port
in old way as include too

Only set at the beginning of your program #developobject=1
and then include in old way

Here is a summary of instructions to see what big Progress AB2 take
thanks to Thilo's include Files

Please ignore the ! before.To see syntax type in command and press help
or Shift+help or use instructionbrowser.
Only make sure the maco button is pressed
