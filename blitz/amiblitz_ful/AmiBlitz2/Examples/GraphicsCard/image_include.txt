imageinclude changes


Fixed: viewport(scr) changed to viewport(used screen) because scr is always 0

       checking for render.library before guigfx.library because
       guigfx lib open fail if no renderlib availible

Added  image_blitmask {image,x,y,mode} If mode =1 mask blit
       image_method easier use of dopicturemethod of guigfx lib


Problems: On Cybergraphics and real Amigas this is very slow because
          the blitdatas are not copy to the graphiccard on CGFX
