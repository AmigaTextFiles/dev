                          Blitz Mailing List Guide
                          ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@netsoc.ucd.ie>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@acc.umu.se or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

The answers almost certainly no, but it is possible to
read the shift key, on it`s own, in blitzmode?

I've never seen examples but would love it if it could
be done.

Yes, I'm sure it could be done.

If RawStatus(anumber) then NPrint "lshift pressed"
If RawStatus(anothernumber) then nprint "rshift pressed"

I don't know the numbers but they're in the big keyboard map at the back of your
reference manual.

Have you tried the RawStatus command?  I've never used Blitzmode, but
according to the manual, this should do what you want.  (pg 140)

You have to use the BlitzKeys command first to enable keyboard input.

And the codes for the shift keys are $60 (left)  and $61 (right)

@NODE "Mail_3" " Bitplane Addresses "
From: Tom Allerton <tomallerton@hotmail.com>
Date: 07-29-00 21:20:57
Subject: @{b}Bitplane Addresses@{ub}

Hi all,

I need to find out the addresses of each bitplane in a bitmap. I presume I can do this by looking at the newtype .BitMap with amigalibs.res resident, but I don't know the name of the offset for each bitplane. Could someone e-mail me (or the list) this information. Also I would like to know the offsets for all the other intuition objects, can anyone help?

Thanks

Hi Tom,

Here is the OS BitMap structure:

BytesPerRow.w
Rows.w
Flags.b
Depth.b
pad.w
*Planes.l[8]

Keep in mind, this is the OS's structure, which is NOT the same as the Blitz
BitMap object.

So, to access it you would do this (assuming you are using Blitz Bitmap 0):

MyBMap.BitMap = Peek.l(Addr BitMap(0))

Now to get the address of the first two bitplanes, you could do this:

*firstplane = MyBMap\Planes[0]
*secondplane=MyBMap\Planes[1]


> Also I would > like to know the offsets for all the other intuition
objects, can anyone help?

Yes, just load amigalibs.res into the Blitz editor, and select "View
Newtypes" from the menu.

This will open a window with all the newtypes in it, and you can select the
one you want to see the info.

Hi,

after some months of delay I've uploaded an updated issue of the Blitz
Developer List. It contains the data of more then 250 (Ex- ?) Blitz
developers all over the world.

You find it at:

#http://www.freiepresse.de/home/jubee/BBLIST_E.HTM#  (english issue)
#http://www.freiepresse.de/home/jubee/BBLIST_D.HTM#  (german issue)

If you want to be added or to update the data about you, simply send me some
informations about you (name, email, homepage, blitz projects, Amiga config
ect.). It lies on you to keep this site always up-to-date.

    For now the price for PC isn't fixed and will probably depend of the
number of sell. And I must finish it before to think to put a price :).

    I'm working hard on the Amiga 1.50 version which will be out in july. It
will brings many new good stuff (popupmenu, excellent protracker support,
large timer support etc..). After I will finish the PC version. A DirectX
support is now working for joystick, sprite and sound. Music support (Midi
and other supported format) sucks and I don't know why. Arg. All is still
wrote in full x86 asm for speed and compactness even if lib can be wrote in
C/C++ or any langage which could output standard .obj files.

    About MicroSoft like policy, I've bought VisualC++ for about 1000 US$
so, hum, PureBasic isn't so highly priced (VB cost 1000 US$ too). 

    Wait and see...

            Bye,

That's a good point. If PB can be put to the same uses as these languages,
the price (in the PC world) would be very fair, but I personally wouldn't
pay out that much without being able to try it fully beforehand. I think if
you did it like Blitz Basic 2 was done, where you could use *everything* in
there, save sources of any size, etc, but not create *compiled executables*,
that would be a good idea...people could go ahead and try developing their
own stuff, but if they want to release it they'll have to pay up first...

  Hah!  If they sell BlitzPC for only $35-40 I will be VERY suprised,
and they wont make much money on it.  The first Blitz for the Amiga was
$179.00 when I bought it years ago, and BB2 was $149.00 a few years
later.  It has only come down to the range mentioned after it was old
and the Amiga market was very small.  The market for such a thing in
the windoze rhealm will be small compared to the market for other
types of software.  windoz users aren't like Amiga users.  Most of
them dont want to think or work (which makes me wonder why they try
to use windoz, which causes problems regularly.  But of course they
just pay through the nose to have an "expert" fix it every time
something goes wrong).  Very few windoz users have the desire or
smarts to be programers, even with an easy to use language.  So the
market will not compare to the market for games and word processors,

so for both Mark and Freds sakes.

  Yeah, most programing systems which are any good are MUCH more costly
than the $35-40 price range mentioned.  You can scarcely buy a decent
game for that price, especially when they are new.  And for front-line
application software, such prices are laughable.  Seldom does a windoz
ap worth it's salt go for less than several hundred $.

  Fred, I am definately looking forward to that 1.50 version of PB for
the Amiga.  If it is good, I will have no qualms about paying a fair
price for it.  What I want is something which fixes the clumsy problems
of Blitz2, is at least as fast, and handles sound and screen formats
better.  It must support AGA well and full overscan hires screens also.
Can do?

  Two of my biggest gripes about Blitz2 are the inability to do a
full overscan screen, widthwise especially (which I could do in the
origional Blitz Basic by the way), and do it in AGA, and the inability
to do precisely looped sounds (in otherwords, Blitz has no way to
detect the end of a sound file and automatically play it again or
play the next sound with no audible gap in the sound.  Both of these
things are absolutly essential to me.

  I want to be able to reliably and easily use 64, 128, and 256 color
screens with hi-res, interlace and full overscan if possible.

  Oh, and also full MIDI support would be GREAT!  I mean with the
ability to use the command channel for mid-stream volumn and expression
changes including the full MIDI command range such as pitch-bend, smooth
volumn changes for (de)crescendos, etc.

Interesting notes: Mark posted on the new BlitzPC board (come.to/blitzpc)
asking if anyone knew anything about the new Amiga SDK (like he's at least
keeping an eye out), but more interestingly, he posted on his site
(blitzbasic.com) that the core of Blitz has become mostly Posix-compliant
(in file handling and stuff I think) and should be easily portable to other
platforms in future. Interested yet? ;)

The original Blitz (wow, someone remembers that?), and early versions of
Blitz2 were produced, packaged and shipped from New Zealand - a stupidly
expensive exercise arising from some misguided patriotic fervour on my and
Simon Armstrong's part.

Once Guildhall got into the picture, the price dropped dramatically.

Maybe, but the market is orders of magnitude bigger. 1% of 1000,000 is
better than 10% of 100,000

A shocking generalization! Admitidly, the PC is stupidly complex and bloated
compared to the Amiga, but it's the only choice anyone interested in
programming really has these days.

I hope so too! I think Blitz and PureBasic will complement each other
nicely. PureBasic seems to have a more GUI oriented design, whereas Blitz
will be more gamey.

Unfortunately, no one has actually managed to explain to me exactly WHAT the
NG Amiga is, and why it's any good! I know it's got something to do with
'operating environments', Java, TAOS, and toasters talking to each other
over the Internet...but...it's all just a little too abstract for me.

In my opinion, the most interesting thing coming out in the near future is
MacOSX. It's GUI looks really, really cool, and it's got that kind of 'wow'
factor that I remember from when I first saw an Amiga. It's also based on
the rock-solid Mach kernel (used in the Next OS), and is capable of running
the entire MacOS as one process.

I reckon this is the direction Amiga should have taken. Like MacOS, AmigaOS
has no memory protection mechanism, so could have been implemented as a
single process within a larger, memory protected OS. Bingo, backward
compatibility and a sexy new OS as well. Instead we get this kind of weird
hodge-podge of technologies that sits on top of another OS.

I also like the look of the X-Box too, but I wont go into that..!

And my bread is always buttered on the side that hits the floor.

Right, here's the explanation :)

The new Amiga is strictly, an OS (rather than hardware + OS) and is based on
Tao's Elate system.  The Elate system has the rather neat feature of a VP,
or Virtual Processor....so when you write for Elate, your programs are
stored as VP binaries (as opposed to 68k binaries, x86 binaries and so on)
and when run, te VP translates your program into native binary code on the
fly.  This means that you have complete hardware abstraction, as long as
people are using the Elate system, as the only difference between an x86
Elate system and a PPC Elate system, is that for the x86 the VP translates
to x86 code, and for the PPC the VP translates to PPC code.

What this means, is that you can develop on an x86, and anyone around the
world can run that program on their Elate system.  But if you're worried
about speed, you need not be....apparently the VP van translate VP code
/faster/ than the hard-disk can spool the code from disk.  But if you still
want to make opimisations, they have a system whereby you can create (for
example) an x86 binary, and if run on an x86 machine it will use that code
(if not it uses the generic VP version).

It's also supposed to have a very, amiga-like API.  Oh, and Tao's Java VM
(named Intent) is said to be the fastest around

Does that make sense?

It only sits on top of Linux (and possibly Windows on the next version) for
developers (so you can get debug info if the thing crashs), the final
version will run without "hosting".

> I also like the look of the X-Box too, but I wont go into that..!

Ewwww.....evil! ;)

Okay, here's a thing :)

Gary Peake has said that Amiga Inc. has a number of copies of the SDK set
aside for "internal" projects...that is old developers of the Amiga that
have proved themselves with invaluable software...and that they are quite
happy to talk to people about helping these developers out (they /may/ be
talking to Marcel Beck about porting YAM...*sssh* ;).

    Yes, it can do. Blitz mode has disappear in PureBasic so you can open
easely an overscan screenmode... Blitter lib in PureBasic is much faster
than BB2 one and sound replay is .... 20 faster (takes virtually no time
:*). AGA is of course fully supported. Protracker replay will be available
shortly after the 1.50 release.

    You can't have an easy stuff to detect the end of a played sound...
PureBasic can't do it (for now). But in PureBasic you can specified if a
sound should be looped or not.

Not really, Linux is a great development platform. It comes with all sorts of useful tools.
Admittedly it does need something like BlitzBasic. (Subtle hint) ;)

I'd say there are huge numbers of Windows users that don't really
care about programming or technical things but there are also a
large number that do want to program. There's at least three Blitz
(or Amos) type languages for Windows platform now, each with a
different approach. So, there's one place to gain some customers
if BlitzPC becomes the better option. A decade ago we must all
remember how Amos and Blitz caused such a surge of amateur
development in the game and utility scene, there's no real reason
why general computer users of today can't have similar needs. I
think already a big percentage of those people are already
developing things using C++ or perhaps VB but a lot of the
casual/amateur programmers are unlikely to find those languages
ideal.

Well, my main reason for replying to this post was more about
Amiga NG than Windows programming so treat the last paragraph
as only a casual bit of input.

Just to get you up to speed on Amigas future..

(Wow, Rick beat me to this but I think i ca compliment his
explanation with some ovelapping stuff here and there...)

Amiga NG is a software ONLY thing. Amiga Inc are in the software
market. However, they have very good links with hardware makers
including the top of the market CPU, GFX card and general hardware
people. This means they can orchestrate the design of a 'first'
new Amiga towards the end of this year. Bill McEwen called this
the 'AmigaOne'. It's going to be fairly high performance but
very low cost. This wont by any means be the 'standard' Amiga
but it will be the first of a series of licensed machines built
by third parties. Eventually you'll see official licensed Amigas
in all shapes and sizes from the smallest hand held to big
server boxes and of course every desktop design you can imagine.

In addition to these hardware solutions, the new Amiga will also
run on top of all major OS's including Linux (which the developer
kit shows), BeOS, MacOS, Windows, QNX etc. Amiga Inc claim they
can support any new OS in a matter of a month (or two). As well
as this 'any OS you like' concept, there's also an 'any CPU' thing
going on. Amiga will run happily on x86, PPC, MIPS, Transmeta,
Alpha etc. Once again, any new CPU that turns up can be
supported in two months. So there's just no stopping Amiga!

The development base of the new Amiga is based on three main
programming languages, these are Java, C/C++ and VP. The VP
thing is the most interesting part. VP, standing for Virtual
Processor is an abstraction of any real CPU that Amiga can
run on top of. You code in 'VP Assembler' and the code will
run on Amiga no matter which CPU the machine has. The Virtual
Processor code is for an abstracted CPU, the OS will execute
this code which is converted (very quickly) before running on
the native CPU. The VP code is very much like Asm code with
some clever macro's. The code can be made to look like
regular Asm but an at times look very much like a higher
level language such as Basic/C with it's if/endif and while
loops. rather than comparing registers the old Asm way
you can do it like "if p0 == 0". The main thing to realize is
that VP will run on any machine. And that's why VP is form of
tools on the new Ami.

I'm not totally sure how C++ compiling works on the new Ami
but afaik if takes C/C++ code and turns it into VP byte code.
This means the compiled C will run on any machine just like
hand crafted VP Assember. This is what a potential new Blitz
language would have to do. Amiga Inc claim in the SDK that they
are actively seeking "Ingenious new Amiga specific languages"
to compliment the standard Java and C++ languages. The SDK
contains a huge amount of documentation. The manual alone is
quite an impressive introduction to the impressive new Kernel
and the current Languages + VP. The manual is 300 pages
but the CD contains the equivalent of a further 1200 pages of
documentation in PDF format.

The new Amiga OS does have many things similar to the original
OS. Things such as Arexx, Message Ports, tiny efficient Kernel
design and Boing Balls are just a start!

I guess I've only really touched on Amiga developments here
with a short description of the whole picture. I don't really
wont to get into any heavy discussusions regarding the way
Amiga is going or viability of all this. I'm very confident
about the Amigas future, we'll see a lot of real great things
happen well before the end of the year. I now feel that there's
no question about whether Amiga will be a sucess, it will! But
I'm just hoping they make the right

One thing Amiga lacks at the moment is a 'sexy' GUI and that's
one thing I hope they get right by the time it's ready for
commercial use.

The Amiga can sit on another OS but can also run native. The
way Bill McEwen mentioned this at the Neuss conference is, they
plan to take the market from both ends. Allow people to run Amiga
as a dedicated OS or to casually use it on top of their current
OS of choice.

I have to buy a Mac soon because it's such an important market
for me as an 'alternatives' developer. For the next year at least,
the Mac market will be my main source of income. However, I really
don't like the current Mac so if this MacOSX thing is so good
it may come as a relief to me! Otherwise, my Mac box will be
destined to become an AmigaNG box as soon as that is possible.

I wanted to be able to put a date compiled value into my program, but

Compile this program and stick it into your user-startup.   Then
include the output somewhere in your Blitz program and away you go.

Or, alternatively, delete it.

Subject: @{b}How to scroll bitmap@{ub}

Hello,

    In which way I can open a screen with more than 256 colours (HAM, HAM8)
and create a bitmap with depth larger than 8??? Is that possible to do? 
    Second thing is showing 15/16/24 bit graphics by BitmaptoWindow command
(there has to be bitmap with depth larger than 8 - I think?) on the
15/16/24 bit screen ie. on CyberVision 64/3D and CyberGraphX system.
    Third. Can I show gifs, jpegs and other formats of gfx in Blitz, and if
yes, how???

Kind Redgards...

Hi Daniel

> create a bitmap with depth larger than 8??? Is that possible to do? 

I think there is a flag you can set for specifying a screen to be HAM or HAM8, 
and you'd need to use the long version of the Screen command:

Screen 0,0,0,320,200,6,$800,"test",0,1 ; HAM screen, 320x200
Screen 0,0,0,320,200,8,$8804,"test",0,1 ; HAM8 hires screen 320x200

However, if you wanted to open a screen width a depth of >8 then you could 
probably do it using the ScreenTags command, or the NScreen command. If not, 
then you'll definately be able to do it with OpenScreen_. You may need to 
specify the correct screenmode ID, which you can get with an ASL requester, or 
maybe with the BestModeIDA_ command (although that way isn't very good).

If you want to allocate a bitmap with depth larger than 8, you'd either have to 
use NCS commands or use the AllocBitMap_ command.

I doubt you'd be able to use BitMapToWindow, since Blitz bitmaps would be 
limited to 8 planes. You could use BltBitMapRastPort_ though.

Leigh Parry I think done some functions for use with datatypes, so you could 
use those. http://web.ukonline.co.uk/lparry/

@NODE "Mail_21" " IDCMP_RAWKEY "
From: Damir Arh <damir.arh@telesat.si>
Date: 07-23-00 16:01:59
Subject: @{b}IDCMP_RAWKEY@{ub}

Hello!

I am having problems reading keypresses from a window in a system friendly
manner. I used to use RawStatus(), but I'd really like to use the IDCMP
messages now.

I tried to do it with the help of the Blitz manual and came up with the
following:

The window is already opened with the #IDCMP_RAWKEY flag by default
(DefaultIDCMP documentation mentions that it reports the keypresses - I
guess this is it), so there is no need of adding it. After I open the
window, my main loop looks something like this:

While NOT EndLoop
    If WaitEvent = #IDCMP_RAWKEY

        ; here I'd need to read the keypresses
        ; for testing purposes I've got the following
        NPrint RawKey
        NPrint Qualifier

        ; the rest of the code

    EndIf
Wend

I only get printed zeros all the time, i.e. both the RawKey and the
Qualifier command return 0, no matter what I press. Though the program
enters the part of the code inside the If sentence so the window must
receive the RAWKEY events only those two commands don't return the values of
the pressed keys.

What am I missing here? I'd appreciate a small working example or maybe a
piece code that would achieve what I am trying to do in the above example.

Any help is appreciated.

I managed to solve my problem myself in the meantime. I just had to use

You must add the MOUSEMOVE  IDCMP to your window before opening it.
You also need to add  INTUITICKS to make the arrows work.

Just do this:

AddIDCMP $10|$400000

Now open the window and it should work.

@NODE "Mail_27" " Knowing when my screen is in front "
From: Damir Arh <damir.arh@telesat.si>
Date: 07-24-00 16:30:54
Subject: @{b}Knowing when my screen is in front@{ub}

Hello!

I have come accross a problem. I would like to have the pointer invisible
when my screen is in front and at the same time I'd like to read the
keyboard events. Both of these can easily be achieved using a window. When
this window is active, the pointer can change appropriately and I can
receive its IDCMP events.

The problem is that the user can switch screens (and I want him to be able
to do so). Let's say he does then something on some other screen. When he
gets back to my screen, the pointer stays visible and my program doesn't
receive any input until the user clicks on my window (which he doesn't even
have to know that it is there).

What I'd like to do is to activate the window everytime my screen gets in
front. By doing that the pointer will immediately disappear and I will also
receive input.

Any ideas how I could do that?

Kind regards

You could try something like this:

lock.l = LockIBase(0)
*firstscreen.Screen = IntuitionBase\FirstScreen
UnlockIBase lock

if peek.l(addr screen(yourscreen)) = *firstscreen

  <your screen is the front one>

endif

I haven't tested this, but it should work..  then again, I've been writing
C all morning so who knows.. :)

Hope this helps though.

Damir, like John says, that should do it, but if not, I've got working code
similar to this on my Amiga...I'll hook it up if you can't get it
working...only thing is, you'll have to keep calling it when your window's
deactivated, and it freezes Intuition for a split-second...

Well, it appears that there's only one thing that prevents me from making it
work. I've come up with the following code, which starts executing when my
window gets the IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW message:

InBack.b=True
While InBack

    lock.l = LockIBase_(0)
    *firstscreen._Screen = IntuitionBase\FirstScreen ; the problem spot
    UnlockIBase_(lock)

    If Peek.l(Addr Screen(0)) = *firstscreen
        InBack.b=False
    EndIf

    For i = 1 To 50
        WaitTOF_
    Next i

Wend

In the marked line Blitz reports garbage at the end of line. It appears that
it doesn't recognise IntuitionBase\FirstScreen. IntuitionBase tokenizes and
it obviously isn't understood as a NewType with FirstScreen field. I found
the struct in the autodocs and I'd be able to access it in C but my
knowledge of Blitz is obviously too limited.

At the same time I'd like to ask whether there is any better solution to the
periodic poleing with a WaitTOF_ loop? Interrupts obviously wouldn't work
(intuition calls) so I don't see any other solution.

Sorry, I was thinking C when I wrote that a little bit :)  Blitz won't
accept IntuitionBase as a variable, (in C i'd cast it as a struct
intuitionbase *) so try something like this:

*ib.IntuitionBase = IntuitionBase

and then

*firstscreen.Screen = *ib\FirstScreen

I usually stick a delay_ 20 or so into my loops, which works well, and
gives you 20/50 of a second worth of delay (I think) :)

Here's the code I have to find the frontmost screen. Weirdly, it only

not when it's part of *something.IntuitionBase. This works here (include

It was meant to be a FindScreen replacement as I recall...

Hi all,

Just to let you know that the archives should be available on Aminet within the

Is it possible to get this (just the profiler) somewhere?

Also, you said the execs must be compiled in debug mode - I'm guessing that
means with the debugger left on?

But wouldn't this add the usual slowdowns you get from running in debug mode
into the profiles, thus confusing the issue?  (Since some stuff seems to
slow down a lot with the debugger on, and other stuff doesn't show much of
a slowdown...)

Forgive me if I've got it wrong, I only just found out what a profile is...

Hi,

A profiler lets you determine how much time is spent where in your program.
Usually, it returns a function-versus-time table showing where your code's
spending its time. This allows you to work out which bits are worth
optimizing and which aren't. Very useful!

You'd probably have to download the Amiga E package from Aminet. I'm guessing 
that it is http://ftp.uni-paderborn.de/aminet/dirs/aminet/dev/e/amigae33a.lha 
(1.6Mb). However, the readme mentions that it has a limited compiler and you 
need to register for the full version so I'm not sure about the profiler.

> Also, you said the execs must be compiled in debug mode - I'm guessing that
> means with the debugger left on?

Perhaps not, remember that last box in the compiler options window "Full debug 
info". Turn that on and extra debugging information is put into your executable 
(but not the debugger, unless you highlight the runtime debugger box) for 
things like function addresses, variables and things.

Yeah, if the runtime debugger was on, I'm pretty sure it would screw up some 
results. Example being if you turn on the Assembly debugger and run an assembly 
function, it can run slower than some Basic code :( Plus, not all commands have 
debugging code in them, so you'd get a skewed result.

Yes, the symbols present in a Blitz executable must be the same as EProf
expects, handy :)

It probably would, but it will still tell you which is your slowest
routines. Optimise them best you can, then compile without the debugger for
an instant all round speed up.

If it is similar to the gadtools kind of edit hooks, me and Dave Newton hacked
together something a while back for gadtools string gadgets, I'll see if I can
pull it out. BTW, the example C code was from the Libraries RKM I think.

@NODE "Mail_53" " Multiplying Longwords "
From: Tony Rolfe <edgewater@shoalhaven.net.au>
Date: 07-25-00 07:32:38
Subject: @{b}Multiplying Longwords@{ub}

I store money values in a longword, as a number of cents (or pence)

125 dollars (or pounds) is stored as 12500.

Multiplying these by another longword (to calculate percentages, etc)
often causes overflows or sets the high bit so the number goes
negative.

I can't use floats, because I need to keep absolute precision.

Some long time ago I remember reading something about using an 8-byte
field to store the result of a multiplication of two longwords.  (Not
in Blitz, just some generic thing many years back).

Does anyone have such a beast in Blitz?    A function like:

Newtype.Result
A.l
B.l
End Newtype

deftype.l Long1, Long2
Deftype.Result Answer
Multiply{Long1, Long2, &Answer}

And, then, how do I use this Answer in a division to get a long result
at the end?

The sort of sum I'm doing is:

Depreciation = OpeningValue * DepRate * Days \ 36500

DepRate is the depreciation rate as a percentage, hence the extra
divide by 100.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks

There are 64bit maths functions in some of the Amiga maths libraries (also
utility.library).

You'd probably have to write a function to interface with it and call it in ASM
though, but it would look something like this:

Statement SignedMult{a.l, b.l, &answer.Result}
    getreg  a6,UtilityBase        ; utility.library base
    JSR     -198(a6)              ; call SMult64 (I hope the LVO is right)
    move.l  d3,a0
    move.l  d0,(a0)
    move.l  d1,4(a0)
    asmexit
End Statement

There's also unsigned functions, divide instructions, modulus instructions, all
in 32 or 64 bit.

If the number is small enough, you can just use the second longword in the
result, otherwise you might need to use some more of the 64bit number functions
in utility.library.

Its on the Developer CD v2.1 in the Contributions/Kneer_&_Apt/RTG/ drawer. I
daresay you could find it on Aminet or their website too (don't know the URL
though, sorry - there doesn't appear to be too many docs with the DevCD :)

It'll likely work fine -- just set up Miami with a generic modem setting and

It will probably work without any bother. Try Miami (30 min Shareware) or

Yes, certainly - it plugs right in.

Miami is not free, but there is a demo version available.  You'll need it to
connect to your ISP.
It's fully functionsl (as I recall) but has a time limit on it.

YAM (emailer) IS free, and it's great.

No free browsers that I know of, but there are demo versions of AWeb,
Ibrowse, and Voyager.

Try 'em all and see which one you like before shelling out your cash...

Yes, but the trick is that most (as 99%) of all PC's in the world only use 9-pin
D-SUB connectors :o>

Yes, that means PC's aren't hayes or RS232 compliant. Why would they need to
follow IEEE standards ?

So unless you have another serial port (like Squirrel Surf or a Multiface card)
you might need to get another cable. Really good modems (such as USRobotics)
come with a cable that has both 9 and 25 pin connectors at one end.

But you are right most PC modems work with an AMiGA, unless they are so-called
"Winmodems" or made by MultiTech. Both seem to not bother following IEEE
standards. Winmodems don't have rockwell chips and rely on windows sorting out
stuff going down the serial cable (Yeah, that's really clever :o>) and multitech
seem to have their own agenda.

Not too hard.  If you wanna see if bit 0 is set (1), use something like If
variable.b AND 1=1, if you wanna see if bit 7 is set (128) use If variable.b
AND 128=128.  If you wanna see if bits 3 and 4 are set (8 + 16) use If
variable.b AND 24=24.

If you want to mask out the lower 5 bits, variableb.l=variablea.w AND 65504.

If you want to use the top 11 bits as a number on its' own,
variable11.w=variable16.w RSR 5.

Well, -I- know what I'm doing, anyway.  =]

Hello,

I know that you can read in individual BYTES using Blitz, but is it possible
to read in individual BITS from a file?

I can't see any commands to do it. Would reading in a byte and then using
Mid$() on it work? Probably not :-)

I'm trying to get data from MP3 files about bitrates and things and they are
stored in BITS according to the documents I have.

For example:

AAAAAAAA AAAxxxxx (A represents the frame sync in an MP3 file)

That is 11 bits, and when set total 255 (FF) and in AZap, which only appears
to show single BYTES, it does indeed come out as FF, and NOT 11111111 which
I am wanting :-)

Any ideas?

Hi Gareth

Of course, but you need to work with bytes and then mask out the bits you are 
not interested in.

No, you'd read in a byte and then mask stuff out, using logical operations, 
such as AND and OR.

No, I think you'll find that when you have 11 bits that are all set the value 
will be 2047.

In the above case, you'd want to read in a word, so that you read in all the 
bits you need (plus any extra but we can discard them) and you are reading in a 
multiple of 8 (cos you can only read in full bytes).

Assuming you are using normal Blitz file commands:

; read in the two bytes which contain bitrate
bitrate.w = Cvi(Inkey$(2))
; shift the bitrate value right by 5 binary places
bitrate = bitrate LSR 5
; bitrate (shown in binary) will now look like 00000AAA AAAAAAAA - the xxxxx
; has been shifted out of the right end of the number and discarded
NPrint "decimal: ",bitrate
NPrint "hex:     $",Hex$(bitrate)
NPrint "binary:  %",Bin$(bitrate)

One more consideration you might need to check is the endian format of the 
numbers. This is the way the CPU stores the data in memory (and would probably 
be the same in the file). There are two options: big endian and little endian. 
Big endian is the way 68k stores numbers, with the most significant (biggest) 
byte (MSB) first in memory. Little endian is the way x86 stores numbers and 
this is the least significant (smallest) first (LSB).

The endian type has no affect on a number which is a single byte in size, i.e. 
hex number $69, would be stored in memory as "69" either way.

For example, if we have the hex number $DEAD, then DE would be the MSB and AD 
would be the LSB. The number would be stored as "DE AD" on 68k and "AD DE" on 
x86.

If we had the number $DEADBEEF then DE would be MSB and EF would be LSB. On a 
68k it would be stored as "DE AD BE EF" and on x86 it would be stored as "EF BE 
AD DE".

So, if after trying printing the value and it looks totally wrong, it may be 
because its stored as a little endian number. To convert a word between endian 
types, use this function:

Function.w EndianWord{val.w}
    ROL.w #8,d0
    AsmExit
End Function

And for longwords, use this:

Function.l EndianLong{val.l}
    ROL.w #8,d0
	SWAP d0
    ROL.w #8,d0
    AsmExit
End Function

> show single BYTES, it does indeed come out as FF, and NOT 11111111 which I am
> wanting :-)

FF(hex) is the same number as 11111111(bin) just written in a different way. To 
the computer it is the same. To you it is the same, just written different. As 
is 255(dec). You just need to stick it in a variable and then display it the 
way you want (binary, hex, decimal, etc).

Jeezus Krizt Dave!, you probably scared him off it now.. hehe :))
But I dont think there is really an easier way to put this sort of stuff..
You should probably read up about binary Gaz, comes in very handy knowing

It probably could have been put simpler and shorter. And I only included the 
endian stuff at the last minute when I looked at the binary number again. You'd 
normally store a number in the lower 11 bits of a number, rather than the 
upper, which made me think it was little endian, but it might not be :)

Why not just use MPega.library?  That will allow you to get all the info
you need, and you can actually decode the MP3 file if you want :)
I have a little prog I wrote a while ago that uses mpega to decode an MP3

Yes please, especially if it gives information on bitrate and sample-rate

Hi Toby

Gonna fix your clock, McFly? :)

Nngh. Its not ASM, its binary logic. And you don't need to know ASM to use the 
endian functions. BTW, this may be another long answer, but its easier than the 
last one I wrote.

BTW, instead of using decimal for creating masks or doing other logical 
operations, its a lot easier to use hex or binary.

variableb.l=variablea.w AND $FFE0

variableb.l=variablea.w AND %1111111111100000  

Basically, the rules are:

if you want to set a bit to 0, you AND that bit with 0. If you AND a bit with 
1, that bit is left as it is. This you can use to mask out bits by setting the 
unwanted bits to 0.

If you want to set a bit to 1 you OR that bit with 1. If you OR a bit with 0, 
that bit is left alone.

If you NOT a bit, you toggle that bit (0->1 and 1->0) although, you cannot work 
at a bit level with NOT by itself, i.e. it will toggle all the bits in your 
variable at once.

If you EOR (exclusive OR) a bit with 1, that bit will be toggled. If you EOR a 
bit with 0, that bit is left as it was.

If you LSR (logical shift right), the number gets shifted right by however, 
many bits you specify. The bits on the left (MSbit) get set to 0.

If you LSL (logical shift left), the number gets shifted left by however, many 
bits you specify. The bits on the right (LSbit) get set to 0.

e.g.

;---8<-----8<-----8<-----
Statement ShowVar{var.w, info$}
    ; this just shows some text, and the variable in hex, binary and decimal.
    ; the right$ commands are there because we are using WORD sized variables
    ; but the Hex$ command and Bin$ command always assume LONG sized variables.
    NPrint RSet$(info$, 34),": $",Right$(Hex$(var),4)," 
%",Right$(Bin$(var),16)," ",var
End Statement

NPrint "All values follow on from each other"

var1.w = $FFFF
ShowVar{var1, "Original value"}

var2.w = var1 AND %1111000011110000
ShowVar{var2, "Set some bits to 0"}

var3.w = var2 OR %0000011000000110
ShowVar{var3, "Set some bits to 1"}

var4.w = NOT(var3)
ShowVar{var4, "Toggle ALL bits"}

var5.w = var4 EOR %0011110000000000
ShowVar{var5, "Toggle SOME bits"}

var6.w = var5 LSR 3
ShowVar{var6, "Shift all bits right by 3 places"}

var7.w = var5 LSL 5
ShowVar{var7, "Shift all bits left by 5 places"}

So following the above, if the bits were %1111111111111111, and I executed
the aboove instruction, it would change to %1111111111100000 ?

And LSR and LSL are equivalent to a multiply and divide by 2 respectively,
for integer numbers.

I mean of course "inverse respectively" here.

To clear up any confusion I might have caused:

If you have a binary number %00101001 = 1+8+32 = 41 and then shift it to
the left you get %01010010 = 2+16+64 = 82. If you shift it the other way,
then you get %00010100 = 4+16 = 20. These are simple multiply and divides
by two - obviously in the second case this doesn't work *entirely*
correctly, but we are just working with integers here.

This is exactly equivalent to decimal counting, where shifting to the left
is the same as a multiply by ten. Thus 100 LSL 1 = 1000 (if the syntax is
correct). The only difference is that binary is base 2 and so the shift to
a higher place results in a multiplication by 2.

Cheers,

Roger

Of course, everyone knows that that should read RSR and it should also be
explained here for the simpletons (ala moi) that shifting a value right by one
bit effectively divides by 2.  shifting by 2 bits divides by 4, 3 for 8, so on.
 MUCH faster than using DIVI, so when you only want to divide in squares of
2...  this is the way to go.

DM> If you LSL (logical shift left), the number gets shifted left by however,

Same here, except LSL multiplies instead of divides.  Watch out for numeric
overflowing though.

Ummm, no, Cuz that would end you up with only 6 bits in the top of the 16bit
value...  What I /meant/ was to move those 11 bits down to the bottom of the

Anyone wanting to manipulate bits would have either first read up or asked 
about binary numbers, never mind manipulating them :)

Why should it be RSR when the command is LSR?

L - logical (i.e. with the bits)
S - shift the bits
then either 
L - left -OR-
R - right

giving you LSL or LSR.

A small piece of code that demonstrates bit operations, and they had already 
been explained. There's only 6 operations that I showed. Surely its easier to 
see them in action, especially since I had already explained what they did.

Indeed - and I personally think that using decimal is more confusing. If
they understand the structure of the number, which as David points out
they should do, then using hex / binary makes it a lot clearer. It would
probably make it clearer when you wanted to explain what was going on as
well - the reason David's explanation of bit masking was good - you could
see each bit and where it was in the word. Hex is not *quite* as
comfortable in this respect, but once you get used to it it's fine. A hell
of a lot better than decimal anyway.

Better using an ASL requester, so the user can choose their own screenmode if 
necessary.

Or even BestModeIDA_ if you are just using a fixed screen size.

There wasn't much intrest, so I'm going to get a proper archive together,
with some decent examples and such, and then release that with the current
source code included.

Yup, I got the necessary information from the Genesis author.  They don't
quite work the same though, Miami says it's online once it's finished
connecting, whereas Genesis reports being online as soon as you hit the
"online" button...before it's even dialed :)

Anyway, I figureed it'd be useful for people who maybe want to do automatic
version checks, or need to periodically check if they're online or not.

I have a small problem that I am hoping you knowledgable lot could possibly
help me with. I am trying to open an intuition screen of size 640*256*8.
Using the following taglist I can open a screen of 320*256 fine but if I
change the width to 640 it appears to open a 640*256 screen but displays it
in lores so I only see half of the screen:-

SETINT 5
   If <<test for Ctrl_C>>

First attempt GURUed because I used a string variable.

Second attempt  (without the Nprint Line)...   The END statement seems

Obviously "End" can't be used inside an interrupt, probably because the code 
isn't called on your task or something.

Anyway, perhaps the solution would be just to set a flag in the interrupt and 
then check for that flag in your main code. It would be a lot quicker just 
checking a flag than doing the whole check for the setsignal each loop, i.e.

SETINT 5
   If <<test for Ctrl_C>> Then ctrlc=-1
end setint

.loop
    ; do stuff
    if ctrlc
        ; do whatever
    end if
    ; repeat loop

This would also have the advantage that you could do different things in 
different places in your program when ctrl-c was pressed. For example, in the 
main loop or whatever, it may quit the whole program, but in a sub-processing 
loop thing (for example, sorting all your customers) it might just quit the 
sort and go back to the main loop.

Or you could just use it to quit the program I suppose :)

I was afraid of that.    The problem is that I don't actually have a
main loop in this program.    (Well, actually I do, but it takes
several minutes per iteration)   There are about 30 internal loops
which may also take several minutes and they, in turn, have internal
loops etc...

I was hoping to have one place to add the code, but I guess I've got
to go down into the depths with lots of tests :-(

I'd rather think that 'End' is too long a chain of commands to be called from
within an interrupt (says something like that somewhere in the documentation :)

perhaps it is possible to change te return value on the stack to a 'quit'
function, which might look something like this (David might know the exact 
		commands, *wink wink*)

interrupt_thingy:

  pop return value from stack
	push address of quit function on stack

	let the program continue.

I'm not sure if you need special privileges to do this kind of thing...

A good idea, and should be fairly straightforward. Don't know if it'll work 
though, might screw with the stack a bit too much, but I'll give it a go unless

Hmm, maybe not such a good idea. Was just reading my 68k manual and when you 
get interrupts the return address of whatever was interrupted gets stuck on the 
stack (obviously). However, there would be a problem if you had interrupted an 
interrupt - since changing the return address would mean that some interrupt 
handler never gets completed.

And then there's the problem of your interrupt being called when its another 
task that was running (same problem as above, not returning to the right place).

And finally, I don't know how it works in Blitz, but there is a piece of OS 
code that gets called before all the interrupt service routines are called (by 
the OS code). So you couldn't really return back skipping that OS code.

I don't think that'll work.

Subject: @{b}SortList Array()@{ub}

Does anyone know of a bug with the SortList command which would
suddenly stop it working?

I've had a bit of code running for about three years, completely
unchanged, and now one SortList is always failing.

Is there a limit to the number of entries or array size (I've got 3500
entries in an array defined for 5500)?

Symptoms are mouse freeze  followed by black screen, followed by
auto-reboot.

Thanks

An update...

I've increased stack from 4096 to 81920 with the same result.

The real symptoms are a mouse freeze.      

Any thoughts would be appreciated

I hate this...

The problem was that it took 40 seconds to sort the data and froze the
mouse while it did it.

After 10 seconds of frozen mouse I rebooted???

Does your array just hold strings?

No, just one longword

Newtype .Thing
Fred.l
End Newtype

I've now sussed out the problem.    It was just simply a time thing. 
My 030/25 took 40 seconds to sort the array and the mouse was frozen
for that amount of time.     After 15 seconds or so I thought it had
crashed and gave it the three fingered salute.

Dumb, aren't I?     I wasted two days on that problem ;-(

It still shouldn't do that if you're in "Amiga mode" -- multitasking OS, and

It could do if it really did use up all 100% CPU, or maybe it calls a
disable()/enable() part for maximum CPU usage :)

I do that... Hate waiting not knowing whether it will
ever unfreeze. Which in windows is a little more hazardous 
than on an amiga, since it happens every 5 minutes.. So I`ve
had to force myself to stop whacking the reset button
so quickly :)

The benefits of doing that must be miniscule! As someone else said, Windows
does some freaky freeze-things, but strangely, it almost always comes back
out of them eventually!

Hmmm...well if that`s the problem simply drop your tasks priority slightly
before you run that, and then return it to normal after it`s completed that
task. I imagine that would allow the os some cpu cycles for it`s upkeep. If
it does call disable then that`s pretty bad especially for long periods, and
as James says..the benefits are small on anything but a 68000.

Hope that helps,

Dave

You can write:

    pad.w
    string.s
    text.b
End NEWTYPE

Dim List list.listview(100)

StringSort list(),SizeOf.listview,2
GTChangeList 0,0,list()

Works with strings. I think you can use numbers.

Doesn't come out or doesn't freeze? :)

Probably doesn't freeze, cos it doesn't have much to do with Win9x does
it...?

Doesn't come, frequently freezes, crashs with memory dumps, and even
sometimes just reboots itself like someone hit the reset button, for no
apparent reason....brings back all those wonderful Windows9x memories :)

Actually, no.

I've not changed any program's priority, don't use executive or any
other thing like that.

Can someone try:

Newtype .Thing
Fred.l
end newtype

dim list Array.Thing(5500)

for i = 1 to 3500
   AddItem Array()
   Array.Fred = Rnd(3500) 
next

sortlist Array(), sizeof .Thing\Fred

End

The syntax may not be right, but you know what I mean

I'd love to know whether pointers freeze, just for curiosity.

I just sit and glare at it now.

Yes, it does here.  But, the whole sort only takes 8 seconds on my 030/50...

Anyway, the pointer freezes - but no problem, it returns to normal when the
sorting is complete.

Cosmetic solution: Put up the busy pointer and don't worry about it   ;)

It totally freezes the pointer (on my 040/25) for a whole 11 seconds.

Hey Tony,

 Tried your code and it does freeze...popped it into ira and devpac and
found out why, it simply shuts off all interrupts while it does the
sort...clever eh ;). It doesn`t even call disable/enable just whacks INTENA.
I`ve included my proggy and the interesting parts of the dissembly for ya
(if ya interested). I stepped through it with monam and skipped the
interrupt shut off and it still ran as normal (ie doesn`t have too do that),
figure it was done to speed up sorting on the 68k. A couple of the other
routines use it too, and I`m not sure if they need it or not so you couldn`t
run a patch program to replace them with nop`s (you could do it by hand I
guess if it`s important), or you could borrow the asm for the sort and write
your own without the move #$4000,INTENA. Alternatively just live with it.
I`m sure mark didn`t mean ya to be using it for huge lists anyway ;).

Hope thats some help,

Dave

From: Tony Rolfe <edgewater@shoalhaven.net.au>
Date: 07-31-00 08:50:40
Subject: @{b}String Constants@{ub}

I have a whole bunch of string constants which I define as something
like

GuestName$ = "Guest Name"

This means that there is a literal string "Guest Name" and a variable
GuestName$ and some code to assign the literal to the variable.

It occurs to me that I could do something like

GuestName$ dc.b "Guest Name",0

except that this would not be a valid Blitz String.

Can some clever person show how the blitz string is defined (I think
it is a pointer to the string plus a length longword) but I'm not sure
of the exact syntax.

If some even cleverer person could build me a macro so I can simply go

GuestName$ !StringMac "Guest Name"

That would be even better.

These strings, I know, cannot be the destination of a move.  I'm
simply trying to avoid the overhead of Blitz strings.

Thanks all

Partially.    It does tell me more about the String format.

What I'm after is to define string constants in my program rather than
assign string variables.   Something like

MyString$   DC.l  <<address of here+8>>
                 DC.l  <<length of string>>
                 DC.b "The actual String",0

which I think is the format of a string.

Then I can use this as a source in a move  e.g.

Something$ = MyString$

but not as a destination

MyString$ = SomeThing$   ; Invalid

The point is to cut down on initialization time and excutable size.

Hi all,

  I seem to have come across a bug in to WindowTags function.  When I try
to have the window open on a custom screen using the #WA_CustomScreen
tag, it still opens on Workbench.  I tried switching the WindowTags call
to OpenWindowTagList(), and it *did* open on the custom screen!  

Does anyone know of a way around this, or a way to capture an OS window as
a Blitz one so I can use WindowOutput, etc with it?

Not a bug, just implemented a bit lamely - they should have checked for the 
presence of the CustomScreen tag, but they've obviosuly stuck in their own one 
with the currently used Screen.

So, if the window is one you have opened with the Blitz Screen (or ScreenTags) 
command, simply do a "Use Screen x" before WindowTags.

If you have opened the window using OS commands, or it is a public screen you 
are trying to open on, you'll need to do a "FindScreen x,title$" to grab it as 
a Blitz screen and then "Use Screen x"

> Does anyone know of a way around this, or a way to capture an OS window as

I doubt you could capture an OS window very successfully, unless it was a CLI 
window that your program had been run from.

Well, I've never actually tried this, but...

I think you could get the information from the OS window structure (mainly
the pointer to it's address) and then poke it into an unused  Blitz window
object.

But, don't forget to poke a "0" back into the Blitz window object before you
close it, or end the program!   Otherwise Blitz would try to close the
window that it didn't open - very bad!

The A1200 ROMs are in your A1200, simply. All that needs to be done is to
format a 720k MS DOS floppy, and copy the transrom program onto this. Mount
the disk on the Amiga using crossdos, open a shell, and type:

pc0:transrom >ram:kick.rom

Then copy the file kick.rom to the pc disk, and take this back to the PC.

Or is there some specific problem in this process that's causing you hassle?


Sooner,

        Sandy, having used Amiga WarpUAE and WinUAE.

Freeware (well, free, anyway ;)

Well, mine gets 030/50+ for raw CPU performance (10MIPS according to
SysInfo); a little less in actual use, though it's quite nice still...that's
an AMD K6-II 550MHz (I love typing that :)

I'd guess 400MHz or so. WinUAE is quite useable on 200MHz or so, just like a
bare A1200 but with loadsa memory :)

Course it does :)

UAE with Picasso = very impressive, especially in full-screen mode (looks

Geez, you`ll need 1Ghz bitch to get that speed. I dont get 020 speeds

Picasso works nicely, lovely 16-bit screens. But your on about software
right? Well pretty much everything works if you fiddle around with
it (except for 040/060 stuff, which isn`t emulated yet), oh and serial port
stuff apparently doesn`t work well at all. But it has BSDSocket emulation,
so you can run netapps straight from your windows connection, no need
for an amiga dialer.
No PPC support of course.

> What other questions should I be asking?

Dunno, but you should be knowing that its not as good as the real thing.
Well perhaps it might be if I had a 1Ghz (but that kinda money isn`t
just growing on trees round these parts :))
But it does its job well considering (I thought so anyway),

Hehe, think there are some problems with the debugger in UAE, but

There is the odd problem in rare instances where it won't let you overwrite
a file cos it's "write-protected" (PPaint does this with its prefs files for
some reason -- I just give 'em a different name and alter the files from
Windoze after I've quit. The "Amiga's" hard drives and directories are
simply Windoze folders, so are accessible from both sides; you can use Amiga
programs to create HTML and graphics for example, then use them from
Windoze). Direct disk drive hackery like HDToolBox obviously won't do much
;)

Only net program I couldn't get working was Amster (Amiga Napster, better
than Napster itself!).

Humm, mine doesn`t APPEAR to get a1200 speeds, perhaps I shoud

True True, but the GUI can be a little frustrating, having to switch tabs
and
stuff to close UAE. And having to load configurations and save them
in a weird way is a bit dodgy...
Ah but you can setup as many configurations as you like. You can have
one for say programming work, with its own drives etc., one for
other serious stuff, one for showing off, etc etc..
Also you can have it save to a directory. IE, instead of a hardfile, so you
can access your files through windows :) Which is helpful.

Yeah but it probably wont like non-os stuff much, especially if your using
picasso96.

Does play all your old favourite 300 year old games that don`t work on your
1200
though... ummmmmm nice!

Does too! But the real thing is always better methinks.
(as long as the real thing aint a 7 year old 1200 held together with
selotape
and mouldy pieces of cheese that fell onto it years ago and have started to
eat their way into the plaseic...... of course :))

I was taking the piss out of UAE`s lack of speed :) (BTW - I was taking the
piss
again :))

And I`m serious, I really dont think my system is doing A1200 speeds.
If it is, it`s barely doing them. I`m sure I heard it squeel a few times ;)

Might be a good idea to get AIAB too saves a lot of time (as I found out
having
done it the long way first ;)) (Thats Aminga In A Box BTW, its a fully setup
WB with all the bits and pieces included, everything is there except you
still
need the original WB disks and ROM, which you can download from a site
since you obviously have the originals. (You cant use the PC floppy as a
disk
drive though, cos' it cant read 880k formatted disks, according to the docs
thats a FACT).

You're better using hard-files...the bug you just described is some sort of
bug in the conversion from the PC's filesystem to the Amiga's.

Hi Tony,


Few thing you might be intersted to know:
The UAE emulation is quite fast here on a PII 350, but disk access remains very
slow.

I had both linux and dos versions installed.

Disk access is faster on the linux version than the dos version. (On the dos
version UAE maintain special files to manage the dos file names being 8.3
letters wide. Those files stand in each directory and include the full and
mangled files names.)

However the emulation itself is slower on that very same linux version.
Note another advantage of linux with UAE is that you can mount ffs partitions
rw in linux, so you could for example unplug your hd from the miga and use that
directly with UAE.

You can use blitz but won't be able to do time-critical tasks because the clock
goes crazy and un-regular.

It's like if you were having a flickerfixer+scandoubler and this is a *great*
advantage compared to the original 1200 from my pow (seen the price of those
devices).

No way! This way I can use as much or as little as needed of the PC drive,
and copy freely between them. The problem above is not a major hassle...

Hmm, my PII-350 128 MB ram is way faster than a bare a1200. The only

I have this strange problem whith dopus4. I can't delete file whit

Humm, how come I`m the only one that doesn`t get bare a1200 speeds
then? Perhaps I should check sysinfo, its been a long time since I
used a bare 1200 :)

Normal Problems !!!

Please remember that file system is still Win/DOS. File attributes are not
the same so AMIGA files with active files flags (script, archive, write-
protection) will appear as hidden or worse.

In this case you have to change the file flags from Win/DOS or .... write
a
little AMIGA program which does the conversion ... Blitz Basic is good for
such little programs ...

Yeah, ced defaults to its own routines, you can tell it to use the OS calls
from one of the menus.

?!! I get (raw CPU-wise) faster than my 030/50 on an AMD k6-II 550MHz! Then
again, if you're running Windows NT or 2000 (for the dual CPUs to work),
that might make a difference...

Picasso96 was easy here -- mail me if you need any help setting it up!

Does anyone know how to get the address of the Workbench window?  I can
find it by name, but when it's set to Backdrop mode, it has no name.  I
was hoping there might be a pointer to the window in some WB structure
somewhere, but so far no luck.

I tried this for *ages* and never quite got there. There is a flag for
Workbench windows, but it applies to drawer windows too... :/

Arrgh..  At first it looked like Workbench was always the last window in
the list, but once you unbackdrop it it moves to the top of the list..
Hmm.... I wonder if it's only ever at one end of the list...

Try this...
It looks for the IDCMP flags:
   IDCMP_DISKINSERTED   ($00008000)
   IDCMP_DISKREMOVED  ($00010000)
Which the Workbench window has (but drawer windows don`t)


FindScreen 0
*scr\Screen = Peek.l (Addr Screen(0))
*wnd.Window = *scr\FirstWindow
While *wnd
   If (*wnd\IDCMPFlags AND $18000) = $18000
     address.l = *wnd         ; WoooHoooo.... found it :)
   EndIf
   *wnd\Window = *wnd\NextWindow

Cool, good thinking! :)  I actually came up with another way of finding it
that seems to work so far -- it seems Workbench is the only window on the
screen that doesn't have a Parent.Window.  Maybe I should add your IDCMP
check to be sure though.

Sure the root drawer windows don't have those flags? (i.e. the ones after you
double click the disk icon). And my WB window (I think its the WB window)
doesn't have those flags, but thats probably because I'm running Scalos. DOpus
users might have different results too.

I checked it on Scalos and Dopus and they both have the 
DISKINSERTED/DISKREMOVED flags in the main screen window just like 
Workbench... and nowhere else.
Which window did you check Dave? :)
