   I haven't got the programs working as a Daemon yet- when I tried, it 
opened three programs for every packet sent (and AmiTCP said it had got 
into a loop)! It appears UDP works slightly differently than TCP, I 
think your Daemon has to signal back to the TCP/IP stack that it's 
running or something. I don't think you'll really need a UDP Daemon 
anyhow, as you'll probably being doing peer-to-peer connections, rather 
than using a Server. You could always use a small TCP Daemon, which puts 
up a window, to ask the user if they want to play a game, which could 
then run your game and exit.
