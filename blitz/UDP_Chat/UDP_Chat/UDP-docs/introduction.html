     These examples are useful for anyone who wants to write a internet 
multi-user, fast reaction game (platformers, Quake clones etc), that by 
their nature must have small communication delays (lags). These routines
are for communicating information between machines connected through the
Internet. These programs differ from Paul Burkey's TCP examples in that
they use the UDP internet protocol instead of TCP for speed (TCP is ok
for strategy or turn based games as a slight lag is acceptable with them).
UDP is much faster, but unlike TCP there is no guarantee that your data
packet will get to it's destination (UDP is about 90% reliable); so you
have to write your communication code with this in mind. These routines
use Peer-to-Peer comunications rather than Server-Client (although the
latter is used for Login, and will be used for system messages like 
disconnecting).
  You don't need a internet connection to run these programs, as you can
run multiple copies on the same machine, because the TCP/IP protocol
works the same, wether communicating on the same machine or to the other
side of the world! 
  For details on how to put these Functions into your game <A HREF="e-udp-funcs-in-your-game.html">see here</A> ,
but I suggest you read all these docs first, as these Funcs do most of
the work for you, but you still going to have to do some hard work yourself.
