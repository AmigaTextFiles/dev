   Feel free to use these routines in your program- but give me a mention
in your credits for these routines :-) 
  If your game's shareware, can you send me a full copy of your game 
as well please :-)  
  If your game's commercial, can you contact me first, and we can come to
some arrangement- don't worry, I don't expect much considering the current
Amiga games scene- maybe it'll be just the same as for shareware :-)
