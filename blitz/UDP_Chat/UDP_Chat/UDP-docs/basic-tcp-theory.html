 Question: How does someone find somebody else on the Internet to have a
game with?

 Answer:  Everytime you go online an IP number (like 230.21.202.1) is
allocated to you (your ISP usually allocates you a free number every time
you log in, so each time you log in your internet address changes- if you
have a permanent connection you can have a permanent IP number). You can
also be found by a name (in my case port101.ww.co.nz-
the 101 number will change each time I log on- this is the same address
as the IP number- the TCP stack translates it to an IP number by checking
it up through a DNS server). You need to know this number or name (this is
your address on the Internet), of the person who is acting as Server (type
into the Send To: gadget in UDP_Chat), so you can log into their Server
program (UDP_Chat acting as Server).
   This number can be found out in a number of ways, if you're talking
on IRC, you can find their address in the person's info window (click on
their name and on the query button in AmIRC, and the name on the left-hand
of the @ symbol is their internet address- ie: Anton@max39.ww.co.nz 
- max39.ww.co.nz is their address), or with STRICQ, AmiComSys- basically
through any server/program that is permanently online, which everyone can
og into, so people can find out other people's IP addresses.
  When someone has a Server online, it waits for a log in, on a certain
port number (mine uses 27272), so you have to log into the Server IP
number at the correct port number, at that address. The port number
normally is always the same, so that's not a problem.
  Another way is to log in each IP number of an ISP (if you know what
ISP the person you're looking for is on; say to find me-
port101.ww.co.nz-port302.ww.co.nz - or whatever the upper number limit
is (basically how many lines in/modems they have)- note that the 'port' in
the above address has nothing to do with the port number I mentioned above-
it could be any word(s) really), and try to log in at the correct port
number, if you get a response (and correct one- it might be the correct
Server program, but wrong person!), then you've found the right person, and
can log in.
