&nbsp &nbsp These Functions are useful for anyone who wants to write a internet 
multi-user, fast reaction game (platformers, Quake clones etc), that by 
their nature must have small communication delays (lags). These routines
are for communicating information between machines connected through the
Internet. These programs differ from Paul Burkey's TCP examples in that
they use the UDP internet protocol instead of TCP for speed (TCP is ok
for strategy or turn based games as a slight lag is acceptable with them).
UDP is much faster, but unlike TCP there is no guarantee that your data
packet will get to it's destination (UDP is about 90% reliable); so you
have to write your communication code with this in mind. These routines
use Peer-to-Peer comunications rather than Server-Client (although the
latter is used for Login, and will be used for system messages like 
disconnecting). <br>
&nbsp &nbsp You don't need a internet connection to run these programs, as you can
run multiple copies on the same machine, because the TCP/IP protocol
works the same, wether communicating on the same machine or to the other
side of the world! <br>
&nbsp &nbsp  For details on how to put these Functions into your game <A HREF="e udp funcs in your game.html">see here.</A>  
I suggest you read all these docs first, as these Funcs do most of
the work for you, but you still going to have to do some hard work yourself.
<br>&nbsp &nbsp I've originally written these Functions for use in my own
game <A HREF="http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/ants/pyromid.html">Pyro-Mid</A>, but I haven't had time to do
anything on it for awhile now, as I've been too busy programming these Functions.
 But a couple of other people are going to use them in their games, so I'm 
involved in game creation anyway.  :)  &nbsp One game is <A HREF="http://www.neurosis.powernet-uk.com/">Lifter</A>
by Chris Deeney. We've done some testing over the internet (from New Zealand to the UK)
with it, and all the routines run excellently, and have the same lag as the `Ping'
command does (which is as fast as you can get!). We have a few small problems to nut out,
but that won't be a problem.
