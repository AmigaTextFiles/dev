Aminet FTP by Mail V1.01 - By DARK DREAMS DESIGNS

          <Made in Blitz Basic>


- What is it!?
--------------

It's an aplication that provides an interface for those people who have
subscribed Aminet Upload Mailing List, and have YAM.

With it you can easly select the files you want to download...


-Why?
-----

Because all the other software for this doesn't seem to work!


- Requirements:
---------------

. An Amiga
. YAM (Tested on YAM 2.0.0 Preview 4 and 6)
. Subscription to Aminet Mailing List
. MUI
. Rexx
. OS 2.0+


- Installation
--------------

. Copy the AFM directory into the Yam:Rexx/ directory
  (If there isn't a Yam:Rexx/ directory please create it)

. Run YAM and select "Configurations" on the "Settings" menu:

  . Now select Arexx
  . Select one of the script slots, give it a name and set it as AmigaDOS
  . Select the AFM executable on Yam:rexx/AFM/
  . Save the settings


- How to work it?
-----------------

. Run YAM

. Select the folder where you usually put your new Aminet Mailing List
  Mail

. Execute AFM using the keyboard shortcut or Menu "Scripts"

. Select the files you want to download

. Push the Send Request button and that's all


What is HitWare?
----------------

Hitware means that if you like my software you'll have to visit Dark Dreams
Designs Home Page :)
