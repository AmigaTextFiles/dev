<H1>Blitz Browser</h1>
<H6>Testing, testing! Six</h6><h4>Welcome! <p>This is a demonstration of the HTML browser written in Blitz Basic for Amiga Format. This is a simple file which contains little in the way of HTML codes. You should be able to add support for all the HTML tags you need without too much effort <p>Tags which you should consider supporting include list and table tags. You'll also need to deal with links, but I think I have that one already sussed out and we can see if I get working in time for next month. <p>*&* Having the opportunity to parse the document twice actually makes things a lot easier. If gives you the chance to check graphics files and prepare any images which need rendered. Of course, lack of support for GIF or JPEG in Blitz makes that quite tricky, although a little bird tells me that there could be Datatype support before very long. <p><hr><H2>Hello there!</h2>*&* <img src="plop.gif"><H3><U>This text should be Underlined</U>*&*<B>This text should be in Bold </B>*&*<I>This text should be in Italics</I>*&*</h3><H3>This text should be plain, <B>bold</B>, <U>underlined</U>, and <I>Italic</I> </h3> <p> <H3> But this should be <b><i>bold and italic</b></i></H3> <p> <H3> But this should be <i><u>unlined and italic</i></u></H3> <p> <H3> But this should be <b><u>bold and underlined</b></u></H3> <p> <H3> But this should be <b><i>bold and italic</b></i></H3><p> <H3> But this should be <b><i><u>bold and underlined and italic</b></i></u></H3><p></HTML>
