  FDConvert is the program supplied with Blitz Basic 2, which
  converts 3rd-party library .fd files into Blitz format.

  This is just a quick hack-job to make FDConvert a lot
  friendlier to use,by adding a couple of file requesters...

  I've tried not to use any commands which aren't in the manual,
  so it should still work on WB1.3 (if it ever did!)

  Just run it from WB or CLI (no parameters any more, otherwise
  there's no point ;)

  You'll be asked for the .fd file you want to convert, followed
  by another requester to get the name of the library you're
  converting.

  Then it asks if you want to add a suffix to the end of the
  commands.

  @{b}Example@{ub}

  For FDInfo.library,you'd unpack the fidlib80.lha archive
  to RAM:,install the FDInfo.library in your libs drawer,
  and run NewFDConvert.

  You'd choose "RAM:FileID_Library/include/fd/FileID_lib.fd"
  in the first requester,then "LIBS:FileID.library" in the
  second requester (this actually just gets the name for the
  new Blitz library,so you can really select any library and
  it'll work,but you don't really want your FileID conversion to
  be called PowerPacker.library1,do you? ;)

  If you wanted the commands to have a particular suffix on
  the end, you can type one in : for example, with a suffix
  of "Thing", MadeUpCommand_ would become MadeUpCommand_Thing.

  Otherwise just press return to accept the default command
  names.

  The program should then generate your new library, and
  ask you for an ID number to assign to the new library.

  This is where it gets awkward - get BlitzLibManager
  from ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/amiga/prog/blitz/ to find out
  what library IDs are free on your setup,but be warned that
  on my setup,even though it says ID #1 is free, choosing
  ID #1 screws the new library up...so choose a later free ID.

  BlitzLibManager is still an invaluable program, though, so get
  it NOW! It does much more than this...
