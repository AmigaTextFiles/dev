Hello
-----

	I am a recent AmiBlitz3 user (a couple of months now) and I really enjoy using it. I knew BlitzBasic but never have used it.


Why
---

	I have some basic language knowledge but, to do what I wanted (OS friendly applications), I had to discover how to 'talk' to the OS.

	My learning process was done by following online information and, do first some small and isolated tests. So, do not expect complete application code...

	These examples are the result of my tests and I decided to share them, hoping they will be useful (even only to see how not to do things...).


What
----

	The following AmiBlitz3 code examples are included:

		01_Screen_Test_v1.0.ab3

			This example was done to check how to open hi and true color screens, open windows and plot some stuff.

			This example has the code to:
				- open a 24 bit screen;
				- open a small window;
				- plot some points, lines and boxes;
				- close the window;
				- print some information (some window details);
				- open a big window;
				- plot some points, lines and boxes;
				- close the window;
				- print some information (some window details);
				- close the screen;
				- print some information (some screen details).

		02_Screen&Window_Test_v1.0.ab3

			This example was done to check how to obtain cpu and fpu information, to gather information from workbench screen, to open a window taking into account some workbench screen info, and print some stuff (including using RGB color values).

			This example has the code to:
				- check cpu and fpu info;
				- print cpu and fpu info;
				- gather workbench screen information;
				- print workbench information;
				- calculate window size (taking into account some workbench screen info);
				- open a window;
				- gather window information;
				- print window information;
				- plot some points, lines and boxes (using workbench pens);
				- plot some points using RGB colors;
				- close the window.

		03_MUI_Test_v1.0.ab3

			This example was done to learn MUI coding in AmiBlitz and to develop my Fractel24 user interface.

			This example has the code to:
                - define MUI initial information;
                - Define constants to use with MUI (objects and events);
                - build the MUI interface (objects, groups, ...);
                - create MUI application;
                - define MUI notifications;
                - open the MUI window;
                - handle MUI interface interaction and quit (main loop).
                - close the MUI window.

		04_DOS_Include_Test_v1.0.ab3

			This example was done to learn how to obtain program start directory, deal with chosen directory termination character and how to write a file (to be used to store configurations locally).

			This example has the code to:
                - obtain program start directory;
                - request user for a directory (commented);
                - deal with chosen directory termination character;
                - open a file to write to;
                - write selected directory to the file;
                - close the file.

			Note: when this example is started from AmiBlitz the "program start directory" will be AmiBlitz one (where you have installed it). The file "MyDosIcludeTest.config" (containing "program start directory") will be created in AmiBlitz installation directory.


Requirements
------------

	To use these code examples it is necessary to have AmiBlitz3 installed in your Amiga system.


Usage
-----

	 Decompress the lha file to a place of your choice and open the .ab3 files from AmiBlitz3.


Notes
-----

    Some lines may be commented because they were included for testing purpose or for debugging output, for example.

    These examples were developed using AmiBlitz3 version 3.10 and were tested in version 3.10.1.
