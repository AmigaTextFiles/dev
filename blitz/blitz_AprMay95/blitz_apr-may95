I guess that's because when you use parameters, memory must be reserved
for them and values copied to reserved locations. It's like that in
any language when using "call-by-value"-parameters. Shared variables
mean "call-by-reference"-variables, so no reserving/copying is needed.

Subject: Colours on A1200


Dear All,

I have a program written on the A500 that loads in a palette from an
.IFF file.

The question is what commands will / will not work on the A1200 aswell
as the A500? I don't have access to an A1200 (sob sob - ED) so want to
be "reasonably" sure it'll work when I send it to a friend who has an
A1200. 

Another thing is this: I had to use some strange trick where I load
the palette when in AMIGA mode (obviously), store the values in 3
arrays, go into BLITZ and then use the stored values to update the
"BLITZ" palette - otherwise it got corrupted going from AMIGA to
BLITZ! - any ideas as to a cleaner way to do this?

    Thanks,

        colin.

Hello,

I still have not got my menus sorted out but that's another story. This time
I woundering if any one has used the Subject library.  I can't get it going.
This is basicly what I have tryed,  with out any luck.

drive.w = 0				; testing on DF0:

InitBank 0,(11*512),2			; buffer for the track (in CHIP mem)

If  OpenDisk(drive)
   MotorOn drive			; and the light drive light goes 

;   For track.w= 0 To 159		; I tryed to format a disk.
;     FormatTrack drive,track,Bank(0),1	; but it
;   Next				; do not work for me

   ReadSector drive,0,Bank(0),11	; So I tryed to get just one track

   MotorOff drive
   CloseDisk(drive)
Else
    GTSetString #W,#STATUS,"Unable to find that disk drive"
EndIf

When I examine the track (with that cool RI debuger V1.21 - is that the newest?)
I find it contains heaps of zero's, so I think it does not work.

Just thought I would tell you all.  Thanks for your time.

Subject: Screen bug

Can anyone help me with this problem?

I'm using Blitz V1.7 in Amiga mode on my A1200.  Usually I open one
  or more screens, use ShowTitle_ to kill the title line, then open
  various windows using gadgets and menus simultaneously.

An intermittent but serious bug occurs when the screen occasionally loses
  touch with its bitmap.  The effect is that gadgets appear to the
  right of their "real" position, while menus appear to the left.  It
  happens both running under Blitz and in standalone versions.  Usually
  the program can be quit but memory will not be freed.

Any solution would be greatly appreciated.

By the  way, there may very well be a great advertisement for
  seawater magnesia attached to this.  Such is the price of my
  Internet access.  If you like seawater magnesia, well it really
  is the best!

IFFs - 256 colour ones. I'd use shapes but 256 colour shapes go a bit, well,
kak.

Thanks. Hmmm, not very elegant that. Maybe I'll use PCF lib, if somebody has

I tried DecodeShapes and now I use (snipped code) -

.incshapes
   BitMap 0,120,12,2
   DecodeILBM 0,?mkeys
   Use BitMap 0
   GetaShape 0, 0,0,24,12

   GetaShape 2,48,0,24,12
   GetaShape 3,72,0,24,12

.drawkeyboard

   GTShape 0,$4C,xpos,ypos,0,0 : xpos = xpos + width + 48
   GTShape 0,$4F,xpos,ypos,0,1 : xpos = xpos + width
   GTShape 0,$4D,xpos,ypos,0,2 : xpos = xpos + width
   GTShape 0,$4E,xpos,ypos,0,3 : xpos = xpos + width + 24
Return

End

mkeys: IncBin "M-keys.br"

And every GTshape gadget uses shape 0, regardless of the actual number! Any

Subject: optimisations - lack of!!!



	hello again ,
		from what I can see Blitz does no optimization at all!!!

	I was amazed to find that constants are not precalculated!!!

		ie.  x = 34 + 67

		produces asm:

			move.l #34,d0
			move.l #67,d1
			add.l d0,d1
			move.l d1,addr x

	34 + 67 should be calculated at run time - I couldn't believe this
	one. I mean leaving them to be calculated by the compiler makes it
	more readable - you can see how you got that value (doesnt happen)
		should be:
			move.l #101,addr x	

		I am writing a shoot'emup game - fairly developed and I 
	have spent ages finding better algorithms etc to make it run fine 
	on a 2000, I use a 1200.  (and succeeded) 
		But now I have started converting the crucial routines
	to asm because by doing my own optimisation I can speed it up 
	at least to twice as fast!!(I was giving blitz more credit before)

	Also there is no reuse of registers - even if the variable is in
		the cpu it is reloaded every time it is needed. :(

		Even so these optimisations can be easily fixed when 
	they get around to it. Maybe thats what they're doing now ?

		But Blitz is still a great language to develop in, no
		questions about that.

for what? Thats not Blitz specific. There are lots of programs out there
only AMOS was thinking that they NEED to win you over with lots of 
bullshit editors that you already have. Or are available everywere.
Blitz didnt go and re invent the wheel of things that were already perfected.
It gives a solid tool for any job!

And if you say AMOS one more time, i'll slap you silly. Hehehehhehehehehe

AMOS doesn't compare. so dont insult blitz. This is from (me) an ex-amos 
coder. Amos limited doesnt give you much to grow. its like SCALA or 
AMIGA VISION rather that a programming powerhouse that Blitz iz.

If that doesn't satisfy you, here are more reasons

* Smaller executables than Amos by at least 40k
* Less Frills, More Speed
* Compiler that comes in standard. NO INTERPRATER
* You always see fast action because its ALWAYS compiled
* No shitty BANKS.. REAL Techinques that asm programmers use INCBIN
* Support like crazy...
* You can actually talk with the makers (MARK & SIMON) HERE !!!
* Blitz is just more power! Faster! And cooler!

Hi!

I know there's been discussions about subject but I just though
perhaps there is some cure for it now...thing that worries me
is...yes, the size of executable - in my case it's a bit over 400 K 
and grows all the time (and no, there are no INCBINS)...so I guess 
A500 users with .5 M ram can forget about my project ;) if the memory 
is full of program itself...One way to make it smaller is of course 
try to optimize basic code but that's not enough. As far as I know 
Blitz includes the whole library if only one command is used from 
it...so perhaps this can be avoided somehow?  Any ides/suggestions?

Subject: Problems receiving Elmore's IncludeLib?


This is a lesson in backing up crucial files:  

I offered the full INCLUDE-library for a small registration fee in BUM7, 
and have had a very good response.  In order to keep up with the number 
of people who registered, I decided to enter all the names and addresses 
into a database program.  Having done this, I begin mailing the 
registered version of the INCLUDE library to those who'd paid for it.  
(Thank all of you!)  

Unfortunately, the database program crashed (a full-blown GURU) during a 
disk-write, and the database file was reduced to zero-bytes (after the 
disk finally validated.)  

I have went through as many envelopes' return-addresses as I could in 
order to reply, but there are many who've registered that I have no way 
to contact as of now.  

This situation causes some serious problems: I don't have any way to 
contact those who've registered except here in a public post, and I don't 
have any way of determining whether those who respond have actually 
registered or not.  

I am left with only one alternative.  I am asking that those of you 
who've registered respond in e-mail and tell me how you'd like the 
Elmore-Include library to be sent to you (e-mail, s-mail address, etc.)  

This would obviously be a chance for people to be dishonest and get the 
Include-library for free, but I guess I have no alternative.  I am just 
asking that those who really *have* paid for the include-library to 
respond, and others out there to resist the urge to tell me you have if 
you really didn't.  I won't be able to tell the difference, but if too 
many dishonest people respond, I won't be able to afford to send copies 
of the library to those who have paid for it.

Please be honest, people!


I deeply apologize for the inconvenience, and to partly compensate for the 
long wait, etc.  I will be offering other registered-shareware for FREE 
along with the INCLUDE-Library.   Thank you!

Subject: Size of Executables

There have been some discussion on the list about the size of Blitz
executable files. Well the bottom line is that Amiga programmers
can not forever make programs that will run on machines with just
512K of ram. The Mac and PC are running 8 meg and a hard drive for new
software. What we need for the Amiga is a minimum hardware standard that
all users must achieve. For example, 1 meg chip ram, 2 meg total ram,
Kickstart 2.0 and a hard drive would be the minimum hardware standard.
I think this would allow programmers to produce better software.

  That's not a constant, it's a variable... if you did:

                #x = 101

  That should be converted as you're looking for...

  Why would you put x = 34 + 67 , instead of x = 101 ???

  Your Blitz code, if it looks like the above, can probably be optimized

True enough, but I can't see how a modular compiler could really get 
around this and still be easy to make 3rd-party libraries, etc. for... 
How could a programmer know what variable was "supposed" to be in d5?
A standard had to be developed so that programmers of 3rd-party libraries 
would have a way of knowing where all their information is.  Blitz isn't 
the only one at fault anyway, disassemble a few "C" or "Pascal" programs 
if you really want to be disgusted.

Subject: Whats wrong here?

Hi All,

I am currently suffering a crippeling problem with my blitz programs and I
can't figure out why.

Here is some code:

LoadFont 0,"IBM.Font",8
Use IntuiFont 0
WBStartup
Screen 0,0,0,640,256,2,$FFFF8000,"A screen",1,2
Window 9,10,20,15,15,$1D00,"",1,0
CatchDosErrs
CloseWindow 9
CloseScreen 0


Now when I compile this, it runs, but causes heeps of enforcer hits. When I
run it a second time, I get a GURU 0100000F. From then on, it seems to
cause the same guru, even after a reboot.

I first thought it might be the LoadFont command, as when I removed it, the
program seemed to run, but then I shortened the screen title and that also
seemed to fix it.

I don't know wether I have somehow gotten a buggy object file or not. I
found a buggy windowslib.obj file that was causing problems, but this is a
new problem.

Does anyone have any ideas?

I've used AllocMem_ to scan a file... As far as I can remember there
was some way of getting to a given posn and then reading in a small
part of the the file - even just one byte... I'll check my code...

    Thanks,

I can tell you what I do (e.g. for the debugger, which is hideously big 
anyway).  If I need only one command from a lib (and its not one of my 
libs) then I first try and write it myself (easy in the case of a command 
like CheckAGA - Elmorelib).  If I can't be bothered to rewrite, or 
haven't the time BUT have the source then I'll knick a little code 
(apologies :) ) from the lib and chuck it in a temporary lib of its own.  
This as far as I can tell is the only way to stop the whole library 
growing in size to massive proportions.

Can't imagine what Roketz (I assume you're converting that) must be 
doing if the code is 400k...  BIG program or what (our game is only 400k 
with about 150k of incbined shapes and graphics).

Hey - any one out there got any spare A500s?  Wanna lend us some test 
machines? :)

Hi,
   anyone else noticed this rather lethal bug in Ted?  You know - the bug 
that completely crashes your machine....? :)

   If you haven't then try the following:

	1) Load up TED
	2) Load in a big source file
	3) Move to half way down the file
	4) Now drag the Ted screen to half way down the display
	5) Start dragging out a block
	6) Whilst dragging out the block move the mouse pointer vertically
	  above the Ted screen
	7) Ask yourself why your Amiga suddenly displays a blank screen 
	  locks up completely.

Maybe not everyone has seen/gets this bug - but it seems pretty serious 
to me.  Maybe this bug is only with the latest version of Ted as well?

Subject: some pretty weird Blitz bugs..


I was writing a AppIcon program the other day, and it waited
for an event of $800000 or another thing happening..

it was basically..

	Repeat
	  ev.l=WaitEvent
          cx.l=ExchangeMessage
          NPrint Hex$(ev)
        Until ev or cx

Now, imagine my surprise when $800000 was printed but it didnt
exit the repeat until loop.
Sooo, I called up the debugger, and brought up an assembly listing
and I saw that it only compares the lower word of each variable
(and $800000 is in the upper word) if I dont specifically
specify an equality value, so if I had written
	Repeat
	  ev.l=WaitEvent
          cx.l=ExchangeMessage
        Until ev<>0 or cx<>0

it would work.

Anyone else come across this?
Steve.

HI,

  Since I suggested using Sin and Cos to find the Tan function I have 
tested the Tan function at home and had no problems.  Maybe it`s 
something you`re doing:)  I guess you realise that the Tan function 
expects the angle to be in Radians, NOT in degrees.  That means to find 
the Tan of an angle x, and put it in y, you have to do :

y=Tan(x*Pi/180)

  I hope that helped.

  Theres a command called FileSeek with which you can move to any position
in the file.  Look in your Blitz manual for details of how to use it.

  There isn`t a specific command to free an array, but arrays can be
re-dimmed.  This means that you could re-dim (Just use the Dim command
again with the same variable name) the array with a size of 0, which
will automatically free the old array, and allocate 0 bytes for the new
array.

Thats OK.

Aminet under utils/misc/DansMazes1.14.lha as MailWare.  So far in the 
last two weeks I`ve had two mails, both of which claim their kids like 
it, though it could also be used to generate mazes for a game if anyone 
wants to contact me.  It has the following features :

o Creates mazes upto 1000 by 1000 (could be more, but this seems big enough)
o Mazes have only one route through, and all parts of the maze are accesible
o Mazes can be saved in a packed or unpacked format (packed is 1/4 of size!)
o Mazes can be viewed in 2D or 3D
o 2D mazes can be saved as a bitmap
o Configuration via icon information

Thats about it I think.

That bug has been there since the first TED I ever used... Also, for 
another, real hideous bug--- Try drag-selecting some text like described 
above, and before releasing the button, try entering a 
keyboard-menu-shortcut like Amiga-C or something....  Streams of 
continuous Enforcer hits as TED goes through all your memory munging 
everything it encounters---  In a few seconds an unstoppable, no "Suspend 
or Reboot" GURU greets you....  This one has been around since the first 
TED as well....

I use this technique myself, but it doesn't actually allocate zero 
bytes-- remember element zero is still available and it takes up space.  
If you have an array of longs (4-bytes a piece) and dim n.l(0) the array 
would take up 4 bytes, plus the array header size (which I think is 8 or 
12 bytes.)

Still, it's the next-best-thing for not being able to ERASE an array!

Yes, it can! The only restriction at the moment is that the only path through
is from the top to the bottom, with random positions for both.  The algorithm
could be altered so the position at the top is chosen, but it would be VERY
difficult to choose the end position.  I.E.

NOTE This was NOT produced using the program, but it IS the type of thing 
to expect, though the mazes are a LOT harder to solve when they get upto 
1000 by 1000:)  One thing to note is the way the mazes are created.  My 
mazes are made by placing walls in between blocks, whereas from your 
diagram it looks as though yours are made by placing completely solid blocks.
If you`re not sure what I mean then download the prog and see, the archive is
only about 45K.

Subject: Graphics Manager


Dear All,

Okay, so I finally finished the 1.0 Beta version of my Graphics Manager. The
question is what do I do next....? Whats the best way to make it available to
any one who might just want to have a look...

Don't hold your breath in expectation tho' at the moment "it works".. and thats
about it! It basically allows you (as posted before?) to:

    o   Load in Shapes files.

    o   "Manipulate" the Shapes using these ops:
        -   Copy and Cut
        -   X Flip and Y Flip
        -   L Rotate and R Rotate

    o   Save (some of) Shapes.

It is a Manager not an Editor... for now?

    Thanks,

        Colin.

  Oh, I could run off a list of 10 horrible bugs in Ted, given a little 
time... here's a few...

1) You know how Ted clones the WB screen?  Well, some WB screen sizes 
cause Ted to crash horribly...

2) I don't remember exactly how this one works, but you can cause crashes 
by playing with the menus as you're selecting a block of text...

3) That copperlist in the menu bar really makes the display look hideous 
if you drag the screen up and down, with other screens in front...

4) The filerequester moves to a garbage path if you click too quickly 
(like just as the first entry is appearing)... 

5) why does the entire screen have to update almost any time you do 
anything with a block of text marked?

I could go on and on, but the point is that Ted is dragging Blitz down... 
it makes a powerful language look like a hack... Someone's got to rewrite 
it...

Could you just create the map of the maze and supply some functions

BTW, can anybody tell me if there is a way to link c and Blitz code ?

Its a must really - its a pain in the arse loading several different 
(memory eating) versions of the debugger. Esp. as each version must fit 
Ted, Blitz2, Debugger & deflibs in memory at once - leaving not much left.

I'll leave this alone (since currently the debugger has no selector, 
although you can hex edit the save config file to change the mode in the 
latest version :) ).

Not important to me, but fairly easy to do.

I think this should be left as it is - I have got so used to it that it'd 
take me years to stop myself doing it :).  Although maybe get rid of it 
to stop me making silly mistakes in Devpac and CED.

> And if people ar not careful, we just might 8)

no please Nigel - don't go on and on and on and on.... :)

Maybe Acid should stop thinking about MegaDrive and Jaguar etc and just 
finish ABC.  Or at least hire someone to upgrade/rewrite Ted and finally 
get Blitz2 released.

I think the lib is no longer supported, but I'm sure the source was 
uploaded to x2ftp so that people could upgrade it themselves - have a

There are a number of ways you could go about it-- depends I guess upon 
what you are doing... Are you talking about ".o" files or 
already-compiled executeables?  If you mean executeables, then here is a 
suggestion that will work in most cases, as long as your "C" program is 
only one HUNK:

Dig up a program called "BIN" I think it's on Aminet... The specific 
program I have was written by Bruno Costa in 1989...  Let's say we're 
trying to call a program originally called "cprog" from our blitz code.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<In CLI>
Bin cprog Blitz2:Includes/cprog.bin


<In Blitz2 Sourcecode>


;Your code here
NPrint "Just a test."


;Call the c-program...
JSR ?cprogbin

;End program
End


cprogbin:
INCBIN "Blitz2:Includes/cprog.bin"
Even




---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Passing parameters might be a bit more difficult, but try playing with 
placing a null-terminated string pointer in A0 before JSRing to the 
binary program... I believe you also should put the length of the string 
in D0.

The program's returncode (such as 20 for failure) will be returned in D0 
on exit.

Caution: If the program supplies it's own WBStartup code, then you'll 
probably have a crash if you provide it yourself for the Blitz program.

This is a clumsy way to do things, but it works, and is easier to explain 
than trying to get ".o" files to work.

Hi All,

I need a routine that will convert a date string in the form of

Any ideas?

Sorry, I've had to all but drop amiga development.  The source is on 
x2ftp as NeilsLibs.lha, you might like to grab it and have a look there.

An enforcer hit seems to be nothing new for reqtools, but I'm dueced if 
I can see where they are coming from.  My code was glue between blitz 
and reqtools, but there could easily be some problems in it.

The source code is commented (mostly), so you shouldn't have much 
trouble finding your way around.

Look into the Amiga2Date_ system call... (DOS Library I think.)  Hope

Dear All,

I've got CrossDos and I can't get it to work on my Amiga. I've got an
A500, WB1.3 and 1Mb and 2 FDDs.

It lets me attach either DI0 or DI1 but won't then bring up an icon on
the WB screen. I can use format, and then Dr CrossDos says the disk is
MS-DOS but I can't put stuff on it as AmigaDOS can't find DI1.

Its all strange and annoying... ANY IDEAS?

    Thanks,

        Colin.

I suggest that <Return> should work the standard Amiga way, and <Enter>
the way TED currently works. On second thoughts, let's make it a menu option,
ie:     Menu
         ...           /
         Editing >>  \/ Standard
                        Old TED

I second that. :-)

	Thanks to all who helped with my ignorance of Blitz's Tan function.
I've got it all working fine and I've included a small bit below. Can
anyone see a way to speed it up as it's running far to slow? Is there a way
to use my fpu? I know I could use tables but I'm not sure how. If someone
suggs tables can they tell me how? I'll need a table for 720 divisions in a
circle.

ray_ang=10              ; angle/column
x_dist=20 : y_dist=0     ; relative offsets , distance to wall.

  Show db : db=1-db

[ Excelent advice from Richard snipped out ]

To link c (object) code into blitz,  well I have had this idea for 
includeing it into blitz code.  Some say it may not work but it's 
only a bit of a cludge but it kind a does what I wanted it for.

And I have not put the defines in but they have there correct names :)
if you want to use this for anything at all.  Know rules in useing it.

;  the huge source below.  Includes a cheap hunk relocation for objects.

*obj=?object                  ; a pointer to the incbin of the code.obj

If Peek.l(*obj) = #HUNK_UNIT
  *obj+4                      ; point to hunk size
  nl.l=(Peek.l(*obj)*4)       ; size of hunk unit name
  *obj+nl+4                   ; find next HUNK

  *obj+4                      ; point to hunk size
  nl.l=(Peek.l(*obj)*4)       ; size of hunk name
  *obj+nl+4                   ; find next HUNK

  *obj+4                      ; point to hunk size
  nl.l=(Peek.l(*obj)*4)       ; get size of code hunk
  *START=*obj+4               ; rember where code hunk was
  *obj+nl+4                   ; find next HUNK

  *obj+4                      ; point to number of relocations to do
  RELO.l = Peek.l(*obj)       ; numer of relocations to do

  *obj+8                      ; skip which start hunk coz WE know!

  For sh = 0 To (RELO*4)-4 Step 4           ; relocation offsets
    cv.l = *START                           ; Base Address of CRUNCHER
    cv.l + Peek.l(*START+(Peek.l(*obj+sh))) ; add relocation value
    Poke.l *START+(Peek.l(*obj+sh)),cv      ; modify CRUNCH code
  Next
EndIf

;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; The object code I was playing with was a cruncher.  Written by a friend .
; Or it was some peace of code like a cruncher with a real loctaion table :)
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

input.l  = ?dead    ; not used at pressent
output.l = $4e000   ; output of decrunched file	<-  hell who wrote this :)

*t=?cd		    ; Look look I even pass prometers to the object code.
Poke.l  *t,input
Poke.l  *t+4,output

GetReg  d1,*t       ; pass out put value
Call    *START      ; call object code
JSR     $4e000      ; - bang that hard address -

End

cd:  Dc.l  0,0

object:	IncBin  "crun/decrunch41.o"
Even
dead:	IncBin  "crun/t.cru"		;  why did I put this hear?

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eye Hope that someone finds this bit of blitz useful and very fastenateing :)
This would be cool to implement as a standard instruction within blitz but
as I know very little about such things.  But I try real hard to get my point
out into the publick arena.

Ranting has stopped.

Subject: re: Maths Speedup

Brian:

Use a look-up table, it will really speed things up.
All you have to do is dim an array with 719 elements, and store the
tangent for that angle in each element

e.g

Dim tn.q(719)
for i=0 to 719
tn(i)=tan(i*2*pi/720)
next

or maybe in your case tn=1/tan((i*2*pi/720).
This way the expensive maths stuff (calculating the tan's) is removed
from the main loop of your ray-caster. The speed difference will be
amazing.
Also, I presume you're using .q variables (and if not, then do so). You
can replace all occurrences of /64 with ASR 6 if this is the case- that
will also speed things up as the binarty shifters are much quicker than
dividing. 
Possibly the distance calculation can be speeded up. 
I think that 

dy=yp-yi:dx=xp-xi:xdist=sqr(dy*dy+dx*dx)

would be faster than using powers, and it may be possible to approximate
the sqr somehow with look-up tables if you sacrifice a bit of accuracy,
I'm not too sure.

Basically, try to avoid using maths calls such as sqr, tan etc.
explicitly in your loops, these will bog it down something chronic.

Hope this helps

What I want to do is activate a GT string gadget so that you don't need to

You might want to try:

*item1=Allocmem_(Sizeof.Thing,65536)

As this will zero out the allocated memory - otherwise, Blitz thinks a 
string already exists!

Dear All -

I purchased my version of Blitz II a couple of years ago now (it's 
version 1.6 I think...) and because of a chronic lack of cash at
the time I wasn't able to afford the registration fee.  I'm now
using Blitz on a pretty regular basis (...yeah, it took me two 
years to realise what a cool little language it is...) so I
would like to know:

  1.	What is the latest version of Blitz II, and what support
	does it provide for AGA, and can the assembler handle
	68020 specific instructions/addressing modes? 
  2.	Who do I contact in Australia about upgrading, and how
	much is it likely to cost?
  3.	How do I subscribe to BUM, get back issues, and get any
	other developer support available?

Answers to any of the above would be VERY much appreciated.  Thanks,

-SAM-

Have you set the 'Max windows' setting in the compiler options menu 
correctly? You should probably set this to a few more than you actually

Subject: Still having BIG problems.

Hi All,

I am still having big problems with my program. I created this little test
program:

DEFTYPE.l
pname$="Blitz-User"
LoadFont 0,"IBM.Font",8
Use IntuiFont 0
WBStartup
Screen 0,0,0,640,256,2,$8000,pname$+" - A GUI user editor for DLG BB/OS (c)
P. Eastham, 1995",1,2
Window 8,128,70,353,61,$1000,"Request",1,0
CloseWindow 8
CloseScreen 0
End

to test my theory. Now the first time I compiled this, I had CloseWindow 9,
and so the screen didn't close. Whilst it was still there, I went about
doing some other things, and when I was flashing past this screen, I
noticed the title of the window had changed from 'Request' to some
non-descript garble.

Anyway, I then compiled the above code and tried to run it. It ran fine a
few times, and then locked the system up at the point where it tries to
open the window with an alert number of 0100000f, followed by a series of
enforcer hits. The resulting executable (With 'Create Icons' and 'Make
smallest' active) is 17460 bytes long. Can someone confirm that this is
indeed the correct size for this code?

This problem is really starting to annoy me. Its holding up a whole package
of programs I am writing.

Any help is much appreciated.

    Function Return *li_new
  End Function
 
  *test_list.LINKED_LIST
  *test_list = 0
 
  For count = 1 To 10
    *test_list = List_Insert {*test_list}
  Next
 
  While *test_list <> 0
    Print " ",*test_list\element
    *test_list = *test_list\next_element
  Wend
 
                                                      
 But all i get is trash in the screen (forever).

There's always a mistake made with my releases - at least this one is out 
the way early :)

When trying to run the install script it tries to find the program MDL 
(Make Def Libs).  But I forgot to include this program in the beta 
archive.  Anyone who really wants to use the install script should thus 
compile the Makedelibs.bb2 source into C:MDL.


Thank you.  Thats all folks :)

Congrats! And who says Amiga programers aren't up to stuff :)

Any chance of making it available to us BB programers?  I mean I have two 
adventure games in the planning stages, and right now I'd see them as being 
128-col with the other colours being reserved for the shapes.  Heck, even 
interlaced HAM mode would make a huge diference.

The first time you declare a variables' type it is assumed to be that 
type from then on in your source.

*POSSIBLY* though it would probably be easier to optimize the way you 
compare things in BASIC first...  If you'll send me a code-segment 
containing your slow IF-THENs, I'll see if there is a way to optimize 
them without resorting to ASM... (If you do go the ASM route, you'd 
really better know what you're doing in both ASM and Blitz.)

Comment the code segment if you can so I can see what your intended 
results should be.

It was the Escom vize-boss... :-)

They'll not put the technology in their PC's.
At the moment, THEY DON'T KNOW, WHAT THEY'LL DO with the
Amiga. IMHO they don't know, what for patents they bought.
They has awaitet to become the rights for the C=-logo but now they
get the whole thing... cause they was the only one with a valid bid.

But please let us be serious and let us talk here about Blitz-things.
For things like the future of Amiga, the comp.sys.amiga.misc
or advocacy is the better place... :-)
We will get informations very soon... valid informations from Escom
himself in various magazines.
Let us wait (again :-). Now something is happen. I think it will go
very fast yet...

The standard blitz can lay anim5 file and load in animbrushes as shapes.

If you use our anim library (RIAnimLib) you can play back Anim5 & Anim7 
(short and long types). Our library also supports different palettes for 
each frame.

Subject: Hor/vert scroll help request


If anyone can shed some light on any of the following, it would be most 
appreciated: 

    - My version of Blitz Basic2 is 1.7.  I have been trying to use the
      examples/blitzmode/dbscrolling.bb2 example to understand how to do
      map block scrolling.  I was disturbed to notice that when 
      running this example on my Amiga 2000 or my brother's 1200 that 
      blocks which scrolled into view tended to blink/flicker especially 
      when the joystick was moved quickly to change directions.

      Not all blocks would blink.  Perhaps just a few.  They would continue
      to flicker even when scrolling is completely stopped.
      With the dbscrolling example, I can get this to happen consistently
      if I first move the joystick to the left. 

      Is this a problem with the example or with Blitz?


    - Using the dbscrolling example as a base, I tried to write a 
      horizontal/vertical scroll map block routine with a full screen 
      slice using 32 colour bitmaps.  I don't need to scroll diagonally.
      Blocks really tend to blink/flicker now and I also can't get the
      scroll routine to work yet (wrong blocks appearing).

      Does anyone have a horizontal/vertical block scroll algorithum or
      sample code they can share with me?

 
  Thanks
 
 
  Sincerely

 p.s.   Mikko, thanks for the previous reply on the blitz-list name.

		This is a problem with the example most likely.
		When you move to fast, or change direction the blocks either
	didn't get blitted to both bitmaps(so one is blank- and flicks),
	 or hadn't been blited in time before the next vblank <- unlikely

Theoretically the library can be cludged so that it takes the address of 
a delta frame of animation to unpack.  Thus the programmer could load the 
frames in a few at a time and then tell the unpacking routine where to 
unpack from.  This wouldn't be too hard, but I don't know how 
efficient/fast it would be.

Subject: A few quickies


  Hello all!

  Can anybody help me with any of the following please?


  Query #1:

   I have written an intuition program which uses GTLists quite a lot.
 I was wondering if anybody out there knows of, or would be interested in
 engineering, an implementation of the 'GTListHit' command below...

  ; Code starts here. Don't try to execute/run it - IT WON'T WORK ;)

    Select WaitEvent        ;Wait for an IDCMPEvent to occur
    Case #GadgetUpEvent     ;A gadget has been released
      Select GTListHit
      Case 0
        Select GadgetHit
        Case 0
        Case 1
        End Select
      Case 1
        Select GadgetHit
        Case 0
        Case 1
        End Select
      End Select
    End Select

  ; Code ends

   As you can see from the above, I would like 'GTListHit' to return/hold the
 GTList object number that the selected GTGadget exists within. I know this
 is probably rather wordy and not particularly well explained... Sorry :)


  Query #2:

   In the program I mentioned above I've been developing my own GTList
 scaling routines. Using the 'DetachGTList', 'GTFreeGadget' and 'Free GTList'
 command combination I've been deallocating GTLists and then reallocating
 them at a different size. It seems, bowever, that the GTLists that I've
 finished with and have (supposedly) got rid of (i.e. No longer take up
 memory) are NOT actually being cleared from memory until the program finally
 terminates. I don't think this is the fault of either of the first two
 commands memtioned, however, I'm not sure...
   I really do need some help with with this as a constant memory drain every
 time a GTList is reattached makes my program completely usless (Seeing as
 that is, in effect, its purpose :) )


  Query #3:

   Did anything ever come of the 'IconToShape' command that I asked about a
 while back (esp. RI-Group and Elmore)? I'm still interested in using such a
 command.


  Thanks for bothering to read this request (And for any help)...

Right, first off get onto AMinet and find the crunch mania program.  Then 
find someone with the user library that uncrunches crunch mania data files 
(not sure who's lib it is).  The only command you actually need to unpack 
the data files is

	crmdecrunch source[,dest]

(I think thats the command name)
If you don't provide a destination, the data is unpacked over itself.

So to load your map files, do something like:

	Bload <Myfile>,0
	CRMDecrunch start(0),&myarray(0,0)

That should happily sort the data out for you.

to set the sprite priorities you'll have to directly set the hardware 
registers yourself.  There are no commands inside the library name 
SpritePriority.  I suggest you either get the Hardware REference Manual 
and find out what the bits are you need to set (I think they are in 
BPLCON1 or 2).

I think there might be a displaylib command though that you can use to 
actually change the value of BPLCONx inside the coplist object. Make sure 
that you OR your new value over the value that is already there since it 
almost certainly has other setup information inside the register.

Not quite that easy.  There is the TokeJsr function but I don't know if 
this will require you to directly specify shape to blit.  Also you'd have 
to set up a3 (I think) to point to the Addr Bitmap of the currently used 
bitmap.

My suggestion: but this inside a blitz command library.

Blit does such bitplane of the blit separately, so the cpu is waiting for 
the blit to finish after every frame BUT the last one.

Not quite - read the bitplane thing above.

Dear All,

Speculative question as I haven't tried this yet...

Is it possible to load in the level block maps from file using, say,
readmem_ and then to access this as an array?

    Thanks,

        Colin.

Altering the palette of a public screen like Workbench is a very, very BAD 
thing to do.  (Esp. with kickstart 3.x, as pen-sharing would 
REALLY be screwed up.)  However, if you still want information on 
restoring the palette prefs, e-mail me and I'll send you some source 
examples of reading palette prefs (and restoring them) for 2.x and 3.x.

I could provide help using the LH libraries packing and unpacking

Colin,
	Yup, do something like

	Dim My_Array.b(9,9)
	
	if WriteFile(0,"ram:test")
		writemem 0,&My_Array,10*10
		closefile 0
	endif

	if readfile(0,"ram:test")
		readmem 0,&My_Array,10*10
		closefile 0
	endif

That works fine, I use it for some of my stuff.

   The current prefs files are in Ram:ENV/ somewhere (possibly

   You may be able to get at the colours from the LoadPalette(*)  command as 
this uses that format.  Otherwise experiment with this file.  When not in 
the Env: drawer. They usually reside in sys:prefs/envarchive (guess name

Env-Archive.2 and Env-Archive.3 for different setups).

I tried reading palette.prefs with LoadPalette command but it says it 
can't find CMAP (color map I assume), so it can't be pure IFF file.

  You need to set up an interrupt to handle the MED songs... like so...

 SetInt5
  If si>-1
   si+1
   If si>4 Then si=0 Else PlayMed
  EndIf
 End SetInt


  That should do the trick for NTSC...

Do you mean to save an Newtype in a file or what? I also need help in
this subject!

It could be so easy just to write:

 ...
   resetlist(my)
   if openfile(0,"ram:test")
        fields 0,my.newtype
        while nextitem(my)
            put 0,i
            i+1
        wend
    closefile 0
 ...

[ no warranty, this is *crap* source!]

and now you must put each newtype-item in a variable and put this 
variable in the record... Or is there another way to do it??

The palette.prefs file for 2.x is more-or-less an IFF-ILBM containing a 
palette, but since 3.0 the standard has been changed to a new IFF type called 
FORM PREF.  I know how to parse both these types, as well as 1.3 
system-configuration files to derive the palette prefs you're looking for. 
(Most of the info is in the RKMs.)

  Oh, you want me to tell you??? :)

  Use the following Tags:

#SA_Quiet     , True
#SA_ShowTitle , False

  Also use a MenusOff command after opening a window...

  Use the #SA_LikeWorkbench , True tag... it should help...

First use this code after opening your screen:

 *s0.Screen=Peek.l(Addr Screen(0))
 *v0.ViewPort=*s0\_ViewPort
 *r0.RasInfo=*v0\RasInfo

Now, use the following code in your main loop:

 *r0\_BitMap=Addr BitMap(cb),x,y
 ScrollVPort_ *v0
 cb=1-cb

Where cb= the current bitmap number (for double buffering)
      x = the x offset within that bitmap
      y = the y offset within that bitmap

This should work beautifully...

Sorry if this has been answered; think our mailer's been acting up.

Anyway, use the intuition call ShowTitle.

I don't have my books nearby, but I imagine it should be something like:

ShowTitle_(Addr Screen SCRN, BOOL)

Where SCRN is the number of the screen object and BOOL is a boolean value
(i.e. TRUE=-1/FALSE=0).

The call takes the address of the screen structure and the boolean.

Could you please send me that information if possible? I don't have 
access to RKMs. 

Ok, so I understan that to get 2.0 and 3.0 palettes we need to read 
that palette.prefs file with LoadPalette. But how is it done in 1.3?

Also is it possible from blitz2 to manipulate palettes on a register 
level. I mean to change value of some individual color without 
changing the rest of them? I assume maybe one way to do it would be 
to create a palette object and assigning a pointer to i, and then 
just read the appropriate field. Something like:

LoadPalette 1, ...
*p.palette=Addr Palette(1)

Am I on the right track?

Thanks for all the help.

It's more dependant on your FLAGS, no tags will set them for you.  Or the

Thanks Rich for your help. I think I figured out what I need to do 
last night. First I store original RGB values using Red, Green, and 
Blue commands and then restore it using RGB command if a WB palette 
gets altered. I think this should do the trick.

   Maciej :

  The function "availMem" only need the "attributes" parameter
  
  so from Blitz you'll have to do...:
    size=AvailMem_ (attributes)
    
  ..from assembler ....:
    D1 = attributes
    D0 = Size
    
  ...AND the attributes are !! ....:     :)
  
   #MEMF_ANY      = 0
   #MEMF_PUBLIC   = 1 ASL 0
   #MEMF_CHIP     = 1 ASL 1
   #MEMF_FAST     = 1 ASL 2
   #MEMF_LOCAL    = 1 ASL 8
   #MEMF_24BITDMA = 1 ASL 9
   #MEMF_CLEAR    = 1 ASL 16
   #MEMF_LARGEST  = 1 ASL 17
   #MEMF_REVERSE  = 1 ASL 18
   #MEMF_TOTAL    = 1 ASL 19  
   #MEMF_BLOCKSIZE= 8
   #MEMF_BLOCKMASK= #MEMF_BLOCKSIZE-1
   
  
  examples :
    size=AvailMem_ (#MEMF_CHIP)     ;free chip mem
    
    size=AvailMem_ (#MEMF_FAST | #MEMF_LARGEST) ;largest block of free 
fastRAM
    
 
  by the way ... this are the same attributes for the "AllocMem_" function
  
                  
  good luck ..GREETINGS !!

Dear All,

Another speculative question....

I know there are "two" types of memory in the Amiga - chip and fast -
but thats about all I now about memory...

A few questions:

1.  What is the difference between chip and fast memory?

2.  What implications does this have on games?

3.  What control does Blitz provide for placing data (or code) in a
    certain type of memory?

4.  What are the implications of different machines having different
    amounts of the two types of memory?

Phew... all answers gratefully received.

    Thanks,

        Colin.

There are some definitions in Amigalibs.Res that would make the flags 
easier to deal with.  You can "OR" them together for combinations as well.

Here they are with a brief example:

#MEMF_ANY=0   		;Any type of memory will do
#MEMF_PUBLIC=1
#MEMF_CHIP=2
#MEMF_FAST=4
#MEMF_LOCAL=256 	;Memory that doesn't go away at RESET
#MEMF_24BITDMA=512 	;DMAable memory within 24 bits of address
#MEMF_KICK=1024 	;Memory that can be used for KickTags
#MEMF_LARGEST=131072  	;Return largest chunk size
#MEMF_TOTAL=524288	;Return total size of memory


;Return all FAST RAM in system:

size.l=AvailMem_(#MEMF_FAST|#MEMF_TOTAL)





Hope this helps!

Well, there are actually types other than these two, but for most 
practical purposes, you can say memory is either "CHIP" accessable memory 
or NOT "CHIP" accessable memory.

 
> A few questions:

The only real important difference is CHIP memory is memory that falls 
within the addressable range of the Amiga's custom chips, which means 
only this memory can be accessed for either sound or graphics etc. that 
use custom chips.


> 2.  What implications does this have on games?

One common example is you end up with insufficient memory for all your 
games bitmaps, shapes, sound etc. even though you have 16M of fast memory 
available.  You're limited to the amount of CHIP ram you have for just
about all your graphics, sound etc. unless you're using a graphics card 
like the Picasso-II, which can use FAST ram for it's graphics.

> 3.  What control does Blitz provide for placing data (or code) in a

UNFORTUNEATELY, there is no control... For now you can't know where any 
code or data will end up when it's loaded.... The only safe thing to do 
is allocate the specific type you need (such as CHIP) and copy data from 
the address of your program's data to this allocated CHIP ram.  It's a 
horrible waste, but until this problem is fixed, we're stuck.


> 4.  What are the implications of different machines having different
>     amounts of the two types of memory?

AGA and ECS machines that have more CHIP memory can use more graphics and 
sound in games than the older, obsolete machines.  With an A1200, for 
example, you have 2 full megabytes of memory for your game's images, 
sound, music etc.  On some machines this is only 512K or even 256K.

chip is the block of memory that all the custom Amiga chips have 
access to. With fast memory only CPU can access it.

all your anims and MODs and anything that has to do with graphics 
must be in chip RAM.

don't know. Would like to know that myself.

i guess you must make sure that if your computerh has and needs 1MB 
of chip RAM to run the game, user's computer also should have that 
1MB of chip RAM. Other than that I don't know.

  Can anyone help me with the following problem?

  I writing a game which uses a 4 bitplane bitmap (16 colours) as the main
  screen, plus a 1 bitplane bitmap which is a b/w 'mask' of the main screen,
  for doing all the collision detection.  I've got lots of 16 colour shapes
  which I blit onto the main screen, and I want to be able to blit a mask of
  these shapes onto the 1 bitplane screen.

  If I try blitting a 16 col. shape on the 1 bitplane bitmap I get the
  "Shape has too many bitplanes" error of course.

  Is there any way of getting a 1 bitplane mask of these shapes, without
  having to actually draw one myself?

  [By a mask I mean colours numbered 1-15 become 'white' and colour 0
  remains black]


  Thanks for any help

After the GTDisable command, use the Redraw command from the old gadgets 
library...  The image is SHOULD to redraw itself and display the mesh 
you're looking for automatically, but since it doesn't, forcing it to 
re-render will do the trick.

As long as you're using Blitz's menu system, you can't add a "real" bar 
item.  That is a property of GadTools menus.  I've seen a lot of people 
"fake" it with disabled menuitems containing dashes, etc. but they never 
look like the baritems of GadTools.  

I'm thinking about writing a library to handle GTMenus soon, but for now, 
I guess faking it with Blitz's Menu commands is all you can hope for.

> B.T.W. Is it possible to add a bar item (i.e. ~~~~~~) to my menus?

What I do is just this:

    Menuitem 0,0,0,1,"item 1"
    Menuitem 0,0,0,2,"------"
    Menuitem 0,0,0,3,"item 2"

And don't do anything in the case statement for the item hit
result.. okay so the line gets hightlighted but it does the trick
visually.

    Thanks,

        colin.

Hi i believe to read GTcycle gadgets you need to GTStatus given with BUM6 
(i think it was any way) or if the command does not exsit use the 
ordinary gadget status command strangly enough called status. 

i hope this infomation is of any use and correct (dont use GTcyclesmuch.)

You have to set the flags in "MenuItem" to $40, and as Menutext you
put "String$("~",length)" . Eventually you have to fit it in the menu
using "MenuGap"

No that's definately the drink talking. Either that or a sinister attempt

  I tried that, but still get the "Shape has too many bitplanes" error.
  The following program gives the same error:


      Bitmap 0,320,256,4
      Bitmap 1,320,256,1

      BLITZ

      Use Bitmap 0
      Boxf 0,0,10,10,1
      Getashape 0,0,0,10,10

      Use Bitmap 1
      BlitMode SolidMode    ; Also get same error using InvMode or EraseMode
      Blit 0,100,100


  Am I doing something horribly wrong or is this a bug? 

  If anyone's got any ideas how to get round this, can they send them to
  my home address (modonnell@niflheim.demon.co.uk) instead of the list,
  cos I'm on holiday for the next week (starting in 10 minutes)


  Thanks a lot,

  Matthew

  After several tests, i found that the problem 
is in the "inicube" statement. Here is my program:
 
Newtype.point
  x.w
  y.w
  z.w
End Newtype
 
Newtype.cube
  c.point[8]
End Newtype
 
original.cube\c[1]\x=0

  original\c[5]\x=0,0,1
  original\c[6]\x=1,0,1
  original\c[7]\x=1,1,1
  original\c[8]\x=0,1,1
End Statement               
 
inicube {}
 
;*********************************************************
 
when i run this, i get the "Software error - task held ...." 
without any Blitz error message. The Guru number is: 
00000003.0000DE30
 
I tested this program in Blitz Basic 2 V1.7 ; the runtime 
error debugger was activated with autorun and interrupt 
checking; and  without any aditional libraries. My computer 
is an Amiga 500, 1MbChip, 1 drive, OS 1.3
 
      
 maybe it's a Pedro's bug rather than a Blitz bug (i hope)

Talking about 3d, I still have those 3d libraries I sent to you ages ago.
You seemed very interested at the time, but I have heard nothing since. 


I could give up and just give them to everybody and forget about the magazines.

Subject: Serial File Input Bug. Crash with Runtime Errors on

Just a quick note to say that I`ve had some problems using
Edit$ to input serial files into variables. The problem seemed
to be something to do with trying to load strings into an array
inside a NewType, but into an element outside those dimensioned
in the NewType definition (still with me?). To make things stranger
the bug vanished when the length of the string to be input with Edit$
was changed, (not necessarily down, just some values didn`t work).
BUT, THE WORST PART WAS...
the runtime error debugger didn`t catch the problem, but caused a
software failure. When my Last Alert proggy came up after the crash,
it seemed that the Blitz2 code had tried to access an illegal (ie. odd)
address! I was using Blitz 1.7 (I think), anyway the update supplied on
BUM 6. I`ve got the problem sorted now, by tidying up my code, but I still
don`t think that it should have bummed out like that, just trying to
access a non-existant array element... hmmmmm.

	just thought everyone might like to no, hope you`re paying
	attention Simon and Mark!

That guru is an address error. Its caused by attempting to read or write a word
or longword that is at an uneven address. It only occurs on 68000 or 68010, so
it might not be Blitz or your code.

Subject: Include-XInclude problem

Hi there,

 I am just using the developper disk 1 with the system includes and
having some troubles with it ;(

I wrote a program that loaded some of the includes like this:

------ cut ---------

INCDIR "includes:"              ; that's where they are

XINCLUDE exec/types.bb2
XINCLUDE "intuition/intuitionbase.bb2"     ; in quotes because it's
                                           ; also a BB2-Keyword ;)
XINCLUDE intuition/intuition.bb2

...

------- end ---------

and all I get is wether the message "Garbage at end of line" or
"include could not be loaded".

How to get it to work?

Subject: wbwidth & wbheight

Hi all 

	I,ve just run into a weird problem concerning wbwidth & wbheight. For
some reason they are suddenly returning the wrong sizes for my workbench 
screens for example my wbench is set for 676 width and 467 height and WBwidth
returns 640 &WBheight returns 400. I haven't ever had any sort of problem 
with these commmands  before so I'm trying to figure out how to rectify 
the situation. I am using V1.9 on an a4000/040 plus I recently used Moned3
to change the position of my DBLntsc Screens so they are centered properly. 
I'm not sure if this could be the problem so if any of you GURU's know the
deal I'd be greatful for any help.

					Thanks In Advance !

Subject: Just a few quickies...


  ( NOTE: This message has been sent before but I'm not sure whether it actually got through or not... So here goes again...)

  Hello all!

  Can anybody help me with any of the following please?


  Query #1:

   I have written an intuition program which uses GTLists quite a lot.
 I was wondering if anybody out there knows of, or would be interested in
 engineering, an implementation of the 'GTListHit' command below...

  ; Code starts here. Don't try to execute/run it - IT WON'T WORK ;)

    Select WaitEvent        ;Wait for an IDCMPEvent to occur
    Case #GadgetUpEvent     ;A gadget has been released
      Select GTListHit
      Case 0
        Select GadgetHit
        Case 0
        Case 1
        End Select
      Case 1
        Select GadgetHit
        Case 0
        Case 1
        End Select
      End Select
    End Select

  ; Code ends

   As you can see from the above, I would like 'GTListHit' to return/hold the
 GTList object number that the selected GTGadget exists within. I know this
 is probably rather wordy and not particularly well explained... Sorry :)


  Query #2:

   In the program I mentioned above I've been developing my own GTList
 scaling routines. Using the 'DetachGTList', 'GTFreeGadget' and 'Free GTList'
 command combination I've been deallocating GTLists and then reallocating
 them at a different size. It seems, bowever, that the GTLists that I've
 finished with and have (supposedly) got rid of (i.e. No longer take up
 memory) are NOT actually being cleared from memory until the program finally
 terminates. I don't think this is the fault of either of the first two
 commands memtioned, however, I'm not sure...
   I really do need some help with with this as a constant memory drain every
 time a GTList is reattached makes my program completely usless (Seeing as
 that is, in effect, its purpose :) )


  Query #3:

   Did anything ever come of the 'IconToShape' command that I asked about a
 while back (esp. RI-Group and Elmore)? I'm still interested in using such a
 command.


  Thanks for bothering to read this request (And for any help)...

WBWidth, WBHeight and WBViewmode functions are all buggy when it comes to 
screen types unavailable prior to 2.0 or 3.0, or with widths beyond 640 
and heights beyond 512.  I wrote a library some time ago to address this  
problem by providing the true values for ANY screen you open or 
"FindScreen."  (Including WBToScreen x)  If you're interested, please 
contact me.

  I had the same problem... Blitz's commands will only return the default 
values... to get the "real" values, do the following:

WBToScreen 0
*s0.Screen=peek.l(addr screen(0))
wx=*s0\Width
wy=*s0\Height


  This should work...

I think the Includes need to be tokenised, not just ascii. You may have 
to load the includes into Blitz, and re-save them to tokenise them.

Well, if I remember rigth, there is one game made by Acid (Mark ?)
in the aminet, which scrolls to all directions, and what`s more,
the source is scrolled on the screen when beginning the game.
Sorry, I don`t remember the name rigth now, but maybe someone else
can tell it (assuming I`m rigth about the game).

Subject: Errors in the AmigaOS-Includes

First I am wondering wether I am the first person to use the Includes (I
got them from BB2 Distribution in Colognia) or the only one having
buggy system includes...

It all started with my program (converting some C includes for TRITON
(a very good GUI Enhancer!!) that I needed the system includes for it.

*BUT* using 'XINCLUDE' seems to work within one (same!) file, but it
doesn't work with several files, like in the system includes.

I xincluded e.g. "exec/types.bb2"
this file xincluded "exec/nodes.bb2" and "exec/lists.bb2"
these files xincluded *both* "exec/types.bb2" again. Result: Error.
I found it out compiling these files after having removed the xinclude
lines...

So, what does this %/&(!-xinclude command exists, when it doesn't
work right??


And: There are some bugs in the includes ... Keywords enclosed by
other letters so that the compiler doesn't recognize them ...

That guru is an address error. Its caused by attempting to read or write a word
or longword that is at an uneven address. It only occurs on 68000 or 68010, so
it might not be Blitz or your code.

Hi there,

 I am just using the developper disk 1 with the system includ=

having some troubles with it ;(

I wrote a program that loaded some of the includes like this:

------ cut ---------

INCDIR "includes:"              ; that's where they are

XINCLUDE exec/types.bb2
XINCLUDE "intuition/intuitionbase.bb2"     ; in quotes becaus=

XINCLUDE intuition/intuition.bb2

...

------- end ---------

and all I get is wether the message "Garbage at end of line" =
or
"include could not be loaded".

How to get it to work?

Hello Blitzers,

I'm here to tell you how impressed I am with Nigel.H's ShapeZ II program.
It's a commercial quality shape editor that's both real simple to use and
very powerfull.

Nigel has put alot of time and energy into it and it really shows.  If
you need a shape editor,  then this is the one to get.  Well done Nigel.

The check is in the mail,  keep up the execlent work.

I bumped into this one some time ago , its quite easy to get round, but because
by Amigas dead at the mo, i cant give you any exact code...
BUT - I`ll try and do it off the top of my head.

NB: full newtypes are in amigalibs.res, or can be convertted from the RKMs
    You need .Screen

function.w WBW
  WBToScreen 0
  *s.Screen=peek.l(addr Screen (0))
  function return *s\width
end function

and replace width with height for WBH.  Thats something like it, but as i said, i cant say for sure, or even that this code is good (havent touched Blitz for about 6 weeks now!)

Get the latest version from Aminet as LESMapEditorV2 (or something).  
It much more stable and shouldn't fall down badly on pre OS3.0.

The latest map editor has an ARexx port with a large instruction base.  
It doesn't support editing itself, but once ShapeZ II has be upgraded 
(Nigel? :) ) to have an ARexx port both programs will be set up to 
communicate together and swap shapes - meaning that you'll be able to 
import/export between the programs.

you can exchange all MenuTitle commands with GTMenuTitle without any

The bar separators are also available for you to use, and since its

You don't really need a command like this, just have unique gadget IDs 
between the lists.  For example, for gadgets on gtlist 0 have IDs 
counting from 100, for gtlist 1 have IDs counting from 200 etc.

Not sure how easy/hard it'd be to implement the GTListHit command.  It'd 
certainly be a little tricky since the same gadget IDs can exist in 
different GTLists.

There shouldn't be any mem drain in you're using the latest update to the 
GT library that I released.  I'm pretty certain that I found every case 
that was chewing memory - I tested several programs with MemMeter and did 
loads of attaching/detaching/freeing etc without any drain.  Maybe this 
is another OS problem - since I am only able to test on OS3.0 I cannot be 
entirely sure that the code is working okay, although there is no obvious 
reason as to why it wouldn't be working.

Same goes for ShapeZ II. It should be fine, it even works with GFX card
screen modes...

Yeah this is my next job. I was going to have a hack this evening.
What you will hopefully be able to do is even have the ShapeZ windows open 
on the Map Editor screen. ShapeZ and MapEd will communicate through AREXX
letting each other know what is going on. Once you have started both programs
you need not know that you are using two separate programs.

Sounds OK to you?

Should have something for people by the end of the week.

I have a weird problem. When i created an executable and then tried 
to run it from Workbench, I get this strange looking system requester 
window: no message, even buttons do not have letters on them. The 
whole requester window is blank, only buttons' outlines are visible.

Weird. Did anybody have similar experience?

Is this on a 1.3 machine?  because Virtual Worlds frequently brings up these
things when it crashes on a 1.3 machine (but the same executable works fine on
a 2.0+ machine).  Is this to do with library problems?

Oh, when run from a cli, these appear less often - its a very intermittent
thing.  The requester i think possibly does have  _some_ text, but its in
white on white - and is only just visible on the window borders.  If youve seen
it then you`ll know what i mean.  And then maybe you`ll know what the hell it 
is!

This means you have runtime errors enabled. If you get an out of memory 
experience then my guess is the machine can't even handle telling you 
that it is out of remember.

I use to know how to fix this... shit I've forgotten.

Subject: What the hell is happening at Acid


Hmmm,

Well we had to cancel the ABC cover disk for Amiga Format.

We have printed the new manuals, and I am finding my one very
good all though I fogot the bb2 object listings which I miss...

I (Simon) have just finished a major program for Television which
involves zooming through the body and playing games in different organs. 
This has taken some 3 months of my time.

Acid Software is very much in overdraft, I would say how much but our New 
Zealand dollar is doing some very stupid things grrrrr

We will be having cash injected when both the TV company pays for the 
work I have done and we do a deal with CodeMasters for publishing rights 
to Skid Sega which is coming along very nicely.

BUM8 is coming, over 1500 people world wide are majorly pissed off with 
me and Icannot go on with out appeasing these bad vibes which arrive 
daily in the mailbox, via the phone, through the net and occasioanally 
the odd drunk down at the pub...

BUM8 will not include a new editor, it will include some Acid libraries 
and a section of the new manual with the rest of it available to you our 
humble users at cost plus nz%.

The new manual IS ringbound, and Giles our UK manager will be happy to 
print sections for those wanting to offer printed documentation to their 
libraries.

Blitz, the Jaguar and Andrew's Amiga are now connected and doing well. We 
have some 400 polygons in half a frame and we think the Jaguar is well 
quite a suitable graphics adaptor for an Amiga, quite frankly I do not 
see how C= can come out with a chipset that is better or cheaper.

So what does this all mean? Yes ABC will be ready for release when Escom 
rolls out the Amiga again. I advise all Blitz users to get off their buts 
and get some demo's together so we can really push it and help make the 
Amiga a success once again. I can count the number of programs written in 
Blitz that I think do it justice one two hands. I hope there is a lot 
going down that I don't know about...

As for Mark, he is still as gloomy a flatmate as one could want... He IS 
going to get his own internet account so I can reclaim my electronic 
responsibility. Actually our discussions regarding networking are kind of 
exciting and of course his help with getting our Jaguar/Sega support for 
Blitz going has been invaluable.

Anyway, I AM sorry about the lack of support and not replying to things I 
should have. Depending on how the money flows I'd say there's a good 
possibility Acid could be the great company you all think it should be. 
However We do have to pay the bills so I'll blame it all on the hardware 
and it's manufaturers, shush, typical software company...

Simon

p.s. can someone please post this on blitz-ami

p.p.s. wasn't the X-Files good tonight?

Have you seen the new version of ShapeZ? People seem to like it, and I would
be happy if you wanted to make it the official Blitz Shape Grabber. I
think you will find it a capable and powerful sytsem. Let me know if you would
like it e-mailed to you.

I think all I want from you Simon, is for you to keep us all up to 
date. I know how long it takes to do stuff, just let us know what is going
on.

It sounds to me like you left "runtime errors" enabled when you compiled 
your program.  Since BUM7 at least, if you leave runtime errors enabled 
in an executeable you create, be sure there is an "END" statement at the 
end of your program, or this requester will appear.

This is a bit of a hack.  The reason that the program crashed is that the 
range of the index should be from 0 to 7, NOT from 1 to 8.  The version 
of Blitz in Bum7 now checks this range if run time errors are enabled, so 
I guess you`re using an older version.  I`m suprised Simon or Mark didn`t 
notice this problem :)

I agree totally.  It would also be nice to be able to do a Dim in a 
Function or a Statement.  Either to redim a SHARED variable and/or to Dim 
a temporary variable for use within the Function/Statement.

Yea, it is 1.3 machine. I don't have any experience using 1.3, i 
always used 2.1 or greater. Anyway, I created executable again but 
this time from compiler options window and it seems to work right 
now. Although i got it once one more time.

I hope it's just 1.3 thing.

  I try to asks for help with a hortizontal/vertical map block (tile) scroll
  routine, and then things really get off topic!  What's the relationship
  between a horizontal scroll and sex?  Don't answer that!

  While I'm here, I do have one more question.  Game programming is quit new
  to me (thats why I'm still having problems with the scroll routine). I have
  however written many business applications in other languages; thus 
  programming/problem solving is not new to me.  My question is this:

    Should one be able to write a commercial quality game in Blitz Basic
    without having to resort to writing your own assembler routines or using
    "advanced" techniques (such as cludges, etc. which seem to come up from
    time to time in blitz-list conversations)??

    Or if I just stick to standard blitz commands (with no to little 
    assembler) am I just wasting my time?  Maybe many of you are advanced
    programmers pushing your ideas to the limits, but it seem you guys 
    (and gals) go through a hell of a lot at times to get things to work
    with Blitz. 

   
    Sincerely

Hey kids! Just wondering if anyone has had any success with the Pointer

the pointer is fine in the top half of the screen, but the pointer goes 
under the bottom half bitmap... I've tried things with InFront, and 
various slice things, to no avail... The only thing I havent done is just 
do a straight MouseX, MouseY, ShowSprite dealy...

Thanks!

  Yes.

  Oh, want more detail? :)

  I have found it to be very easy to program high-quality programs in 
blitz, without using hardware hacks, or even using Blitz-mode.  My 
programs all multi-task, run on 24-bit boards, and don't use hacks...

  Sometimes assembly is useful to gain speed, other times it's 
unnecessarry if you're creative... For the most part, using a combination 
of blitz commands and OS-calls seems to work fine for me... then again, 
I'm not all that interested in getting 60 fps... I can live with less, if 
I gain better gameplay, and more colors on screen...

I think you`re confusing the two different types of arrays.

Theres the   Dim (n)   whose index ranges from 0 to n, and theres
NEWTYPE .foo
  bar.w[n]
End NEWTYPE

which ranges from 0 to n-1.  The reference in the Blitz 2 User Guide is 
probably refering to the  Dim  type.

I think so, definitely.  Although help from assembly routines or calling 
OS routines can be a big help for special requirements in a program, 
Blitz still has enough potential on it's own to write a lot of good 
software, including games.  

If you download 3rd-party libaries, you'll also notice that many of them 
provide an easier interface to features that were only available before 
with assembly and/or loads of OS calls...  But, beware:  Not all the 
3rd-party libraries out there are good ones, so just experiment and see 
which combination of standard Blitz and 3rd-party libraries help you 
achieve your programming goals with the least difficulty.  

If all else fails, you could probably achieve with standard OS calls many 
of those things Blitz doesn't offer on it's own.  They're a bit rugged to 
figure out, but it's worth it to make yourself as familiar with the 
operating system as you can.

I think also in one of the future upgrades Blitz2 (or maybe ABC)

Is  ABC is going to be backwards compatible with Blitz2?

Subject: Blitz Bug Or My Bug? You tell me...

Lets have a little story shall we...  Lets say a person wrote a nice 
debugger, and everything went very well.  The program worked and was 
actually quite useful.  Now lets say that the aforementioned person wrote 
a nice little menus library that took advantage of Gadtools to give nice 
layouts etc.  Now lets also say that he had a thought : 'why not make 
my nice little debugger use that little menu library I wrote?'.  This 
thought sounded nice so he decided to go ahead with putting in his 
library........

-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=--==--=

That was yesterday.  I put in the library and everything went well, until 
I tried to STOP a program using the debugger.  Amazingly nothing 
happened.  The program being debugged doesn't even respond to CTRL-ALT-C 
or the STOP command placed in its source code.  Just the simple presence 
of the menu library in the debugger executable stops it working 
completely.  I don't even have to execute a command from the library to 
stop the debugger working....

I really don't understand this.  The library does nothing special, its 
init and finit routines just open the GadTools.library - I've even tried 
disabling this code but the problem persists.

Let me just clarify this problem slightly by saying if the debugger 
doesn't use my library AT ALL it CAN STOP a program that itself uses the 
library.

Is this some strange bug in the Blitz Compiler I wonder?  Or is it my 
being really stupid?  Because for the life of me I can't work out whats 
going on.....  


Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Well - this just some vague guess - and at 10am so its probably shit 
im talking....

Does gadtools have its own interrupt flag?  as in for a waitevent type command?
is it some patch for this that maybe gadtools has added, and maybe your checks
(which i assume are on some kind of interrupt) are just clashing?

This is a _guess_ so if im completely off track - dont go hitting me!

I won't hit you - but I'd guess you were on the wrong track :)  The menus 
are ready in by using the current commands WaitEvent/MenuHit/SubHit etc.

I`v had a bit of trouble recently with the ShowBitmap command as I found 
it difficult to create a bitmap the same size as the one used by the 
screen.  Apparently the screen uses a bitmap slightly wider than the 
actual displayed width.  I found this out by using the ScreensBitmap 
command and looking at the bitmap newtype from within the excellent LES 
debugger, and if I create a bitmap using the XClip field as the width 
then all problems are solved.

Two questions really:
Does anyone know why this is?
  and
Is there anyway to know this size in advance without actually creating 
the screen, getting the ScreensBitmap and then Peek ing the XClip value?

Basically a repackaged new version of Blitz (was to be essentially the same
program as what you would get with BUM8 - but due to delays....).
New manual (ringbound).

When you set up a display theres a parameter at the end - can`t remember
what its name was, but you need to set up copper space for it.  Its in the
BUM6/7 docs, or more easily in the BB2 guide (on the ftp site).

I agree. It's a bit of a waste to use a word to store byte values (0-255).
Especially if you're using huge arrays... :)

Just my .02 cents worth, Patrik.

In your InitCopList command, you must specify a negative amount for the 
copper room... If you're doing an ECS rainbow that only affects one 
register (like color #0) this would be -1.  For AGA, it would be -4.

Then set up your palette and try the DisplayRainbow command.  BTW, if 
you're trying to use it with the PaletteRange command, I've had no 
success with that.  It seems PaletteRange is broken for the time being.

I might be wrong, but I *think* it is the size of the screen to the 
nearest 16-pixel boundry (rounded up.)  That means if you have a screen 
300 pixels wide, you'll need a bitmap 320 pixels wide...

Besides being automatically font-sensitive, GTMenus have the added 
advantage of allowing a REAL separator-bar... (No more kludging it with 
a string of ~~~~~~~~.)  

The biggest advantage has got to be the font/screen sensitivity though, 
try to make a menu with Blitz's menu commands that will look right (even 
with checkmarks and shortcut keys) under fonts from 8 to 24 points.... 
Not very easy to do!

Oh yes, while i'm here,

  Two methods of getting the depth of a bitmap.

    1)  deep.b=Peek.b(Addr BitMap(0)+5)

	  2)  *b0.BitMap=Peek.l(Addr BitMap(0))
        deep.b=*b0\Depth

  Method 1 works fine, but the way i'd prefer to do it, method 2, dosen't.
  No errors are produced, it just returns the wrong value.

  Anyone know what i'm doing wrong?

My map editor has a fully featured ARexx port.  It is on Aminet at the 
moment and includes source for an arexx map operator.  This operator 
source shows you how to set up and manage an ARexx port.

	1) Will the not that new version of TeD at least have a screen mode

	a major bummer. Just a little fix, surely not too hard.

	2) Are you still considering PC Blitz, just about to buy a P60

	3) What do Acid and everyone else who were sent ShapeZ think?

Everthing went well until i came to put in the 'Delete' code.  I realised that when you clicked on a ListView gadget the item under the mouse is highlight then un-highlighted when you press and release the mouse button.  

Is it possible for the item to remain highlighted until the user selects another item or clicks again?  This means you can see exactly what item you

 Let me guess.. You're trying to use the player that comes standard with 
Blitz Basic? If so, I suggest you switch to use Neil's protracker lib.
It seems Blitz uses the same method to play mods as Med does when it 
tries to convert protracker mods. It works fine... Until you get into 
timing and such.. Where it conviently barfs.

Andrew,

Thanks for your suggestions.  I have considered using CIATrackerLib, but 
I would prefer not to have to tinker with accommodating each processor
(if I can help it).

Converting to MED may be an option (providing I can find a utility to do 
this).

I'm going on memory here (mine not the computer's), but was there not a
library, converted from AMOS which could play mods properly.  I believe 
it was by a Paul Reece?


Thanks again

Tom

It would be quite tricky when you consider that Ted does not use OS 
routines for outputing its text (I presume anyway). Thus using a GFX card 
screen mode would either require Ted to be rewritten to use the OS or 
have custom routines for each board added.

I thought it was nice - now put in the saving a shape as an icon thingy :)

Last night I finally sorted out an IconToShape command - for grabbing the 
gfx associated with an icon file into shapes.  BUT I've forgotten who 
actually asked for this command... Yes I know, forgetful wanker etc etc etc.
Anyway, could they give me a quick mail - if they do I can get the 
updated ToolTypes library off to them.

Does anyone know why when I create an executable of the GTB progam on BUM 7

I've copied the fonts to the font dir, and cd into the source dir before I

bugs in it.

I've come across this before with some other programs and can't fine the
problem.

You miss understand me. TeD will not open at all from a Workbench that
is using a graphcics card screen mode, because it tries to copy that
screen mode. I just want to be able to say to TeD, open on for example
a standard multiscan screen. I don't need TED itself in a gfx card 
screen mode.

Hello all Blitzers,

I'm leaving the Amiga scene because I can't make money on the Amiga, 
last night I sold my A1200 & A2000. 

I would like to thank Steve McNamara & Steve Matty for their 
excellent support, help and communication, I wish ACID did this, they 
let me down.

I hope Blitz will appear some day on the PC, at the moment I'm 
developing Multi Media Software & Animations on the PC. I will go 
back to Blitz when the AmigaCard is ready but for now: greetings and 
maybe we meet again. You can still reach me for other conversations 
if you like.

Hereby is the Dutch Blitz User Group gone...

To ACID: change your way of support if you want to survive! I was good
enough when there where troubles here but afther that you let me 
down. Thanks (not).

My last point: Blitz changed my life, it was the most powerfull 
language I used in my Amiga years, I hope a PC version will come! 

CYa!

Subject: Am I moaning? Or being reasonable?

Hello ppl,
	a while ago I asked if people wanted to test out a new version of 
my debugger - to check it works okay and is stable enough.  Well quite a 
few people offered to test it and each of them promptly received a copy 
through email.  Now this was quite a while ago and whilst I appreciate 
that people may be busy with other things I'll like to know what people 
thought.

I belive  Nigel Hughes is having this same problem - people who offer to 
test software but do not actually come back with suggestions or comments 
about the software.

This is very frustrating since it means that I have no feedback from 
other people (except people I'm in contact with everyday).  Has anyone 
out there tested the version of the debugger I sent to them?  Surely 
someone could reply.  Its a pity really because the lack of response has 
held up a release that substantially upgrades the debugger...


I have to say thanx to the ***one*** person who replied about the 
debugger - sorry it was so long ago I can't remember your name... :)


Anyway, I'm off home...

Steve Mc.

Why still hang on this ugly TED? Make a cli-compiler/linker etc. and
the user can choose any editor *he* wants (like GoldED or CEd). TED
causes so many problems and it is far away from being even a little
bit comfortable!

that's what TED does of it:

he tokenises any sh*t of it?!!?? What happened? Can somebody help me?
Can somebody tell the boys at Acid to stop this tokenising crap and to
stop TED? BlitzBasic could be even more powerful when the code could
be compiled/linked via CLI (like E) ...

I`ve just recently found a strange bug during compilation (NOT

S$=GetProgName{}

When this above line is compiled (even if just trying to make an 
executeable) it gurus with #80000004 (Illegal instruction).  Also if you 
try :

S.w=GetProgName{}

it doesn`t actually guru, but if run time errors are enabled it also 
brings up a run time error.


Bit strange really, all I was trying to do was make a function called 
GetProgName{} :)

Here is again my 3d stars example. This is "unbeutified" & uncommneted
early version, I didn't find the other one rigth away.

Red/blue glasses are needed to see the effect of stars coming
towards the "player".

Btw, Matt, I could check those graphics you have already done
for the robotgame.

Subject: I'm a bit rusty--so help me o ut.

	Hey all, I just started getting back into blitz today (I'm going
to code something over the summer--I hope).  So, I printed out my
old source from last summer and whipped up a program that just blits
a ball on the screen according to joystick movements. However, when I 
COMPILE/RUN the thing it compiles, but doesn't appear to run.  The screen
doesn't even flinch.  I'll send the source up if you want (it's really
short), but are there any compile options or basic instructions needed
to get a program to compile and run correctly?  I loaded up my old
half-baked invaders source from last summer and it compiled without
a hitch and ran fine.  So, what's the deal?

That is not what it is for, use the "excess color" optional parameter in 
the blit command to blit a 1 color shape in different colors. Hmmm, well 
you can use bitplanesbitmap for speed but unless you are blitting to a 
clean area of the bitmap you will get color-mixing, which is good for 
somethings but not good for others.

Is this Super NES code?  I'm sure thats got an 8 bit chip like the Z80.

One thing that _might _ be an idea is to have a help type thing (like they

A good one to, actually the old version of ShapeZ used to have a similar
feature, but it kind of got lost in the rewrite, how about a help window,
with alittle bit of text in it saying what the current button is and what
ShapeZ is expecting you to do etc?

No its the coprocessor on the megadrive running at 4mhz with some very 
slow opcodes indeed, makes the 68000K at 7 look like a ferrari.

As for Ami, I've been working on an editor (haven't we all!) which lets 
you design 3D shapes with a number of bizarre tools, god it is so hard 
making things good enough for your average graphics person say what...

Anyway, once you design your lego-3d style shape you can paint on it like 
dpaint so edges can have darker blocks which makes the shape look rounder 
(see harddrivin usa for best example of this technique)).

Anyway, each block is one pixel and the z80 and 68000 are both going to 
be rendering cars on the fly by a sort of recursive line drawing system, 
and seeing as megadrive is nibble per pixel it is a bit quick than old 
ami's bitplanes.

The code is then going onto the gpu of the jaguar, this baby runs at 
28mhz, is risk meaning properly written machine code = 1 instruction per 
cycle. A lo res pixel takes 140 ns, so with a slightly smaller display 
I think we can get somthing like 28mil/320*200*50 gives you something 
like 10 instructions for each pixel at 50 fps.

A fast PC is going to give better performance but unless you have a 
stealth or similar graphics card it takes the best part a frame just to 
transfer graphics into VGA. So PC sucks.

Anyway, back to Jaguar, the DSP is just as fast as GPU so you can 
pre-process your data before it gets to the GPU. For us this means that 
the mountains and shit we have in our new iso-killer can be converted 
from curves (nurby ones at that) into a dense array of triangles which 
the gpu can then merrily draw (1200 per frame at present).

Hmmm, now i think ID have cottoned on to the jag because it is getting 
their next release first with PC so that should be cool. Also street 
price is now less than 150 quid which to me is just awesome.

OK, Amiga is not dead but Ted does deserve to be shot. I will be 
releasing latest source code to Ted in Bum8 and I will have some time 
next week to get it finished.

Sorry for the technical shit but if you get a cable with ABC that lets 
you plug into 60 mips of power for 150 quid I think some of you will 
appreciate this.

I'm off to netscape...

Bye.

That sounds like the ideal solution, is there ANY chance you could send
me the source sooner though? I would be eteranly grateful. Just think
of all of the stuff I have sent you over the last year. Am I begging?
I think I am.

Well, if there are news, that the NN-side of Jaguar is now used to
sell the Jag-system, that some people there only talk about "what amazing system
the Saturn is",  That some people there talks about the death of Jag, that they
have a great lack of software, that Atari's shares will falling down every
week...

Someone told about good "TED" made by some german. Does it already

Have you tried the obvious: using Timer as a seed ?
Ofcourse, if you boot every time before playing, it may not work

If you haven't already got it, I believe BUM5 or BUM6 had my RRandomize 
and RRnd functions that should do what you want... The same set of 
libraries also had a "Ticks" function that is similar to "Timer" in other 
BASICs, so if you do:

RRandomize Ticks
Number=RRNd(1,10)

You won't be able to improve the randomness of that very well, and it's 
pretty darn fast... (Though improved versions of those libraries are on 
their way...)

used Dpaint brushes for my shapes, but when I use the ShapesHit (or
whateveR) command, it seems to detect collisions around a sizable
perimeter surrounding the actual shape.  Just what are the X and Y
values in that command for?  And what are some better sprite collision
schemes? (Or should I have used ShapeZ2 instead of Dpaint to save my shapes?)

wide around the object.  What are the X and Y values for in the ShapesHit
command? Is that to specify the position of the shape you're detecting 
for/against?

When you cut out your shapes you should definately make them as this and 
short as possible as the width and height of the brush when you cut it 
out from dpaint is whats ShapeShit uses (hmmm, did I spell that right?)

How about using a pseudo-random sequence generator?  They're good if you need
lots of *reasonably* random numbers *fast*.

Is the source code going to be usable though?  I personally aren't too 
bothered about the actual source - I'd just like information about the 
file formats that blitz uses and how ted deals with tokenisation etc.  
Also knowing how to interface with the compiler would be nice.

Well it all sounds very interesting Simon...  I'm afraid, though, that some

I could ask about deadlines for BUM8 and ABC, but I'd better not....

BUt it needs to be standardized - maybe we should 'together' make up some
kind of 'standard' way to do this.  Or maybe we should move this discussion to 
c.s.a.programmer, but anyway...

Maybe we could between us write some kind of blitz function that gives a
standard (font sensitive) window for help that everyone agrees looks good.
I dont know if this would be beneficial to people - at least then everyone 
has access to a standard Help thang.

What do people think of this?

Dear All,

various people from Leading Edge mention Blitz Bombers AGA. Well despite
some very bad luck with a publisher, it looks like we may have finally got
a bit of break.

	If you would like to check out Issue 50 of Amiga Power, you will see

	In the next next issue (not the one just coming but the one after that)
of The One (Amiga) magazine you should be able to see a full interview and

	While we still do not have a publisher, The One is very enthusiastic
about Blitz Bombers, and we hope this publicity will lead to a publisher

I think this sounds good (but that's no surprise).

Making standard takes one person, who actually makes the first
version (that could be you Mark), and after that many other's
opinions for making it even better. Taking the discussion rigth
away to c.s.a.programmer could be good - but making a good example
first and then referring to it could be even better.

I have also dreamed a little bit of something else concerning
help for applications: some kind of "living" mascots which
would give the help. That could be nice for at least kids and
beginners... but let's look at that later (if someone with
animation skills is interested, that is).

Mark|All,
	 It would be easy to write a helplib but the issue is how it would 
work. I think it would be an idea have the following commands,

	InitHelp UseWindow#,MaxWidth,Clearwhenempty

	DisplayHelp helptext$

Usewindow can just be so it does not get in the way of your own window
allocation, max width, well stop help window obscuring too much, and
clearwhenempty allows you to set wether the window disappears when over
nothing.

helptext$ can use a simple markup language to allow maybe bold/underlined
text.

The main issue is how you decide which button the pointer is over. 
If you specify coordinates relative to each window, then it easy
IF you only want help for those buttons in the ACTIVE window. If you 
want it to display help for WHATEVER is under the pointer wether it is
active or not, well that is a different matter. It is still trivial
if no windows are over lapping, but I am not too sure how you 
find out which out of two windows is nearest to the front.

I shall knock up a demo program this weekend and you can see what you 
think...

God knows about the style question, I can tell you though that the 
GTBevelBox requires a window to be open - it renders a bevel box into a 
window - you cannot call up whilst setting up the rest of your GTList.

Subject: Standard Help?

I think it'd be nice to have standard systems in use throughout software, 
esp. software geared to blitz basic users.  In our own products (map ed, 
shapez) we are trying to make the presentation and method of doing things 
standard.

Doing a standard help requester/online help system would be a nice way to 
start trying to create a larger picture.  Everyone will have their own 
ideas about what sort of help would be necessary.  Personally I think it 
should be a DOpus 4 type help, where you select the help gadget, then 
click on the gadget/menu item you want help on.  Then a requester opens 
up with the information for that gadget/menu.

Maybe this could be a little compo - we talked about one on the list ages 
ago but nothing every took off.  Now that the list has got some semblance 
of life back into it, it may be a good idea to try something like this...

I could give it a go, but my Amiga`s still not quite sorted (what with a
new HD just gone in there...), so I would say Id knock a little something up
this weekend, but....

Lets see what Nigel comes up with anyway..... (see his earlier mail)

Tis what I thought.  ;}

This could be implemnted as an option.  So that the user could select Help,
and depending on their 'user-rating', then the help comes as either just
a simple few words to describe things, or that plus words, or with a little
'mascot'  The latter is not necessary and doesnt need to be supported by
all, but would consist of some basic anims for the character that could
be put together.  I think this is definitely an extra for 'after'.

I was thinking of something like this...

	.-------------------------.
	|I|_______________________|   <--- Here goes the short desc.
	|                         |
	|                         |
	|                         |   <--- Here goes a longer desc.
	|                         |
	'-------------------------'

Just the window title could be shown for the simplest version of help
with an expand gadget to get the rest out.

As for what Nigel said about implementation..

>work. I think it would be an idea have the following commands,

Something like this is what I had in mind, although commands more like..

InitHelp UseWindow#,x,y,w,h   <-- sets up help stuff 'forever'
ClearWhenEmpty On|Off         <-- a flag so it could be turned on/off as needed
OpenHelp                      <-- open the help window
CloseHelp                     <-- close the help window
CurrentHelp simple$,helptext$ <-- (instead of DisplayHelp)

	A markup language would help, but we only need a few things, such as
bold and underline.  Obviously not neede for simple$ (this is what goes in
the window title).

Thats about all i can think to contribute for now.

Another thought on this help thing - maybe it should be included into the
new Blitz editor (whoever writes it in the end).  The stuff we currently get
on the titlebar could go to the title of the window, and maybe some kind of 
better explanation could go into the main desc.

I possibly didnt make it clear in my last mail that what is displayed is 
whatever was in the last CurrentHelp commenad processed.  Probably fairly 
obvious, but....

This could be the road to take, as it should be much easier to
make such a help than the like talked earlier.

Maybe menus could have help too, via some kind of "help mode" -
when in help mode, menus give help of their functionality, but
don't do what normally.

Well I have just looked through my manuals and it is not as hard
as I though. Should have working demo on Monday, I'll put it
out to vote then and we can go from there.

I like the help system in ReOrg (maybe an old version): You press "Help" (or
select help from a menu) and the mouse pointer turns into a smaller pointer
plus a "?". You now click on a gadget, and a window pops up saying what the
gadget does. To get out of help mode just press "Help" again.

IMHO the best help system I've ever seen. Worked beautifully.

I wouldn't make it like this. Better should be a little online help,
when the mousepointer rests longer than 2 sec. over a window/gadget a
little Requester pops up telling the user what this window/gadget is
for. Try e.g. Triton, a Gui enhancement which offer this.

What about using HTML or the language Amigaguide uses? Do not reinvent

Perhaps if someone will write an optimiser for Blitz, they may want to look

Where the longer desc. should be an option which could be turned
on/off via 
                LongHelp On|Off
So only a short Titlebar pops on, if the user want's it.

To set the text to a gadget, you should use the following thing:

    HotHelp gadgetlist#,gadget#,shorthelp$,longhelp$

And it should work with BlitzGadgets, GadToolsgadgets, MUI, Triton and
all the other GUIs!!

I recommend HTML or the Amigaguide-Language. Do not reinvent the wheel

The easiest method I know of is to put the values into an array of words 
and save it out to disk using WriteMem... The following example may or 
may not create the table you have in mind, but it should illustrate how 
you'd save it out and later access it:

;Build Table (Separate Program)
Dim tbl.w(89)
For i=0 to 89:tbl(i)=Tan(i):Next   ;(You'd probably modify this)

If WriteFile(0,"Bin:Tan90.tab")
	WriteMem 0,&tbl(0),(90*SizeOf.w)
EndIf
CloseFile 0



;This is a different program, to illustrate accessing the table again...

;Get the table's value for Tan(45)
v.w=Peek.w(?tantab+45*SizeOf.w)
NPrint v
MouseWait:End

tantab: IncBin "Bin:Tan90.tab"

No I don't think that is it. The docs say either you get the address of 
the io packet thingy or zero if openserial fails. I'm just wondering if 
you have a funny entry in your mountlist or something that is misleading 
the device... suppose I should try , 1 second...

Yeh, my machine returns zero ok...

I mean, I tried doing a simple starfield for my game intro, and
although the results are not too bad, they are no where as smooth
as the starfield that came with the blanker.
Can someone point me int the right direction ?

Subject: Standard Help Library On Line and WORKING!


Dear All,
	I have with me a new version of ShapeZ that uses my new Standard
help library.

	It is in the end, very configurable.

	There are 3 (user setable) levels of help.

	Prompt,
	Hint,
	Reveal.

	Where the help appears is also configurable. If we have a button


      NW   N     NE
	________
	|      |
      SW|      | E
	|      |
	--------
      SW   S     SE

	You can make help appear at anyof the corners. You can ignore
all of these and just set Help to appear in a fixed x,y position. You can
even have a combination where the x,y position is an offset from N,NE,E,SE,S
,SW,W,NW.

	You may also set a delay (number of INTUITICKS) before the help
window appears, this stops it flickering around after you.

	I have a version of ShapeZ with  this feature in (On the control
window and Editor window) which well let you control any of the above
settings.

	I could also have an option for it only to appear when the user
clicks, which would satisfy all those people who wanted that.

	What I would suggest is for me to write a preferences program so 
each user can set Blitz Help to behave how they want it. Every program that
uses help should check the settings in here.

	I will make up a release for everyone as soon as people have seen
it and OK'ed it. I think you will like it a lot.

	There are a few problems with uneven text formatting, but it IS font
sensitive.

	Anyone who made a request for ShapeZ from Friday onwards will get a 
copy sent straight away. Mark you can have one now as well 8)

Can we try and put this help code into an actual library, as in a
'help.library' file?  Anyone know how to do this, and would this be a good
idea.  Also we can then (possibly) let other languages use it, and we have 
a full help system for any Amiga programmer?

THoughts on this anyone???

I was just wondering why nobody is using the amigaguide.library like 
developers in most other languages do... It's part of the OS since 2.04, 
so it's the "standard" for hypertext on the Amiga...

Combined with a "help-mode" for your gadgets and menus, it appears to me 
it would be the best way to handle "help."

In case there are those of you out there who haven't played with 
Amigaguide.library, you can set it up to open it's window on your own 
screen, as well as load datatypes objects in 3.0 and above... It's really 
pretty nice.

Subject: RE: Making A simple Star Field ?

Just recently Hesham Amiri was asking about how to make a Star Field such 
as that used in the excellent BlitzBlank 2.60, the latest version which 
can be found on Aminet.  Despite the name, most of the blanker modules 
were written in C, and those that are not, such as my Plasma module, 
cannot use Blitz`s own screen/palette/drawing commands, as they are 
currently not compatible with graphics cards.  The BlitzBlank.library 
opens a screen for you automatically, and all drawing/blitting etc. is 
done using OS commands.  If you are familiar with using C then you should 
have no trouble using these OS commands in Blitz as they are identical.  
As for how to create a star field using them, I`ll leave that up to you! :)

If you want a small example of how to interface with BlitzBlank in Blitz2 
then let me know.

Some of us are using WB 2.x and 1 MB of memory you know... A help library
smaller (and faster?) than amigaguide could be a good idea.

well im not sure if you mean 3d starfield or just a simple horizontal
starfield... if you mean the horizontal, there is a cool example of it
on BUM (Blitz User Magazine) #6 ... ask SIMON about getting it!

I guess its prefectly legal for me to send you the code but you
might want to get the whole BUM #6 for its other goodies! Lemmme KNOW!

People keep going on about tutorials/articles about the development of

this Help thing - We could stick it onto the web, and put it into BUMs too.

I think  i may go and make a start on this - I shall for a start make up 
something from all the response thats come from my original suggestion, and
we shall see how it goes from there.  Nigel - maybe you could do a similar thing
but on a more code based level - seeing as youre the one whos actually writing
it!  ;}

	In   that   case,   why   not  have  the  'help  code'  detect  if  the
amigaguide.library  exists,  and  if  it  does then use it otherwise use an
amigaguide   _like_  helper??   The  helper  really  only  needs  to  be  a
'text-reader'  of  sorts,  maybe a 'pix-viewer' but I think that's going to
far.

I'll check when I get time to see if the editor is actually on Aminet - 
it should be up there.  If it isn't I'll get it uploaded.

I think we are getting a bit bogged down with this help thang.

<excuse the possible lack of spaces - this keyboards a bit dodgy>

I think the help lib should just have a small help text that can appear (ill
wait to see what Nigels got...), and possibly also have a link to an amigaguide
or HTML doc. using bookmarks (anyone know how to use those in amigagguide??).

Otherwise we would be reinventing the car, not jsut the wheel!!!

The markupstuff was really intended for the smallhelp text,so that you could
possibly put in the odd italic or bold char.  Yes -use the samecodes as html,
but only support a few.

well, actually I just finished a cool little tool that AUTODIALS my
SLIP account. Its fully definable through the tooltypes...
you set everything including unit#,serial,init command,dial prefix,
name,password...... you set strings to look for like "Password:"
when it gets that it will send whatever you set for the password.

ANYWAY, its cool... it dials, redials..until it connects (if you set it
like that) and the logs you in (sends name/passeord) looks for
a string like SLIP/PPP start at port... (or whatever you set) and then
it quits and (if you set it) starts AmiTCP..... shwooo.

I dunno if this interests anyone. It will be ready any day now. Rich
is trying to help me set a CON: (for the CLI startnet to execute)...

if you could send me some code showing how i can open a con for a cli
program, i would deeply appreciate it :)

Yes, me!! If I only knew more about how to do something like Mosaic,
I'd program it by myself, coz AMosaic is kind of unstable ... But I
don't know much about the TCP/IP or Slip or PPP or whatever ;)

Subject: What does it take?


 So I spend 6 months waiting for US support to be sorted out so I can 
purchase Blitz 2.. And even when it finally is I got the impression that 
no-one really cares if the product is sold or not anyways. So I get 
Blitz2 used. 

 But I'm still not any better off than I was when I was using the demo 
because my project needs libs that won't work anything below 1.8.. (I 
have 1.7)

 What do I need to do now to get this up to the most current version? And 
I TRIED to find out from the person that is supposed to handle US 
support. I must be an ass or something, because I don't get any response.

Subject: Sound Sampling in BB2

Hi Everyone,

I thought I'd drop a line to ask for a bit of help if possible. I am
intending to write a sound sampling/real time effects prog ib BB2.

The problem I have is that I don't know the best way to capture the
samples. Yes I can read the parallel port and extract sample data but
there is no timing involved and I need to be able to apply a variable
sample rate on the capture.

I presume it has to be done through a timer interrupt of some
description but my other attempts at IRQ's other than a vertical blank
IRQ seem to fail dismally. This goes for capturing serial port info
as well (but that's a different story/program).

Any pointers, help, info, sound sampling progam code or someone who can
tell me the answers to everything would be most appreciated.

Cheers for any response.

Greg

Sure I shall have a kind of design/code section if you will work with the 
spec, set up links etc and we should be sorted.


I think the main thing is people grab ShapeZ from my web page or ask me
to email it so they can SEE what I have done. Most peoples suggestions
are already in! Once we have all seen it we can discuss where to go now.

Amiga Guide is tempting, more so than html in my opinion, but is slow
on older machnines.

Anyhow to all those people who have requested shapes by email, it is on 
the way. Did I send you one Mark?

Well, a suggestion sometime ago for higher timing rates is actually already in
the FAQ (still only in HTML on my web page (see the sig)).  

This was to use the Vpos command to get the vcertical position of the beam,
which gives you 1/256 (or 1/200 i NTSC) of a vertical blank.

Dont know if this is fast enough...

  Are you talking about opening up a console?  If so, you need to use a 
completely different setup... I can show you how, if that's what you're 
looking to do... Opening a shell is different, and I've never had to do 
that, so others would be better able to help you there...

I would have offered to do it (seeing as its on my web page), but I am Uni
student, so I dont have access to the net all year (as some of you may have 
noticed!).

If you could handle it Josh, could you please forward any updates you get to
me so i can update my page.

If people want some more details on my web page, then I can handle some longer
text files (if you write `em, Ill spellcheck/edit them).  I cant really let
everyone have piccies - it would fill up my disk quota pretty quick i expect -
so what i suggest is that other people write their _OWN_ web pages with details,
and then i can link into them directly.  If you want details on how to write 
html web pages, contact your sysop/webmaster, and also read through the guide
to writing html - There is a link for that on the BPR section of my website.

My details are...

  Well, unless someone else is really itching to do the Blitz.guide file, 
I geuss I will... Heck, it's not that hard, and alot of the work is 
already done...

  The first thing I will do is separate the guide into a bunch of smaller 
files, to make things easier, and loading faster...

  The last version of the guide I have is version 1.3... is there a newer 
version to start from?

  Lastly, if anyone out there knows of a blitzlib not in the current 
guide, could you send me the docs for it, or at least the location to get 
it from?

OK.  You can only have a web page (basically) if your web address (URL) is
online all the time.  There need to be programs running that handle the 
accessing of your files, and this is normally handled by someone normally
called the WebMaster.  If you are on a Uni account, then you can probably
set yourself up, otherwise it will be harder - i really dont know what you
would need to do (anyone else know??)

Writing the pages once you have been setup on your system is 'fairly'
easy.  You use a markup language called HTML (theres a guide to it linked 
from my web page), which is 'similar' to amigaguide stuff.  Remember that
in mosaic/netscape there is an option to view the actual html source for
what you are looking at - this is one of the best ways to find out what you
can achieve.

This is an OFFER coming up.....

If anyone CANNOT set up a web page on their own site, then I can provide
storage for it.  If anyone wants to do this, then it is _YOUR_ responsibility
to update it.  All I will do is put it into my disk area and link it into my 
webpage.  You send me new/updated files as and when you want.
THIS IS NOT AN OFFER FOR _ANY_ WEB PAGE.  ONLY BLITZ STUFF PLEASE!!!!

Thank you.

Subject: Skidmarks subscription anybody??

Hello,

right first up I have had a really weird experiance...

As I related to the blitz list months ago I sent off my registration details
for Blitz Basic 2 and heard bugger all off anybody which was a shame as I 
had no details of how to subscribe to the BUM's with BB2 and thus thought
that I would get that information after I sent away my reg. form.

To cut a long (and ultimately boring) story short I never heard anything
until yesterday that is when I recieved a letter saying "that as I am a
registered user of Skidmarks would I like to upgrade for a tenner?".  Now
first things first I have never even played Skidmarks and definately don't 
own it and to be perfectly honest would rather get a version of ABC when it 
comes out and a chance to subscribe to the BUM's.

If anybody can help me then please do

and Christ I REALLY hope this isn't a surreal joke of acids..:)

Stuart  muckleys@aston.ac.uk

PS. Does anybody want to swap a skidmarks reg. for a blitz reg and the
chance to get some BUM's??

PPS. Is it worth having Super Skidmarks (or whatever its called) for a
tenner?? Or is it a piece of crap ;) (note: don't get angry this IS A JOKE!)

   YEAH.. I want to open a CONsole for a program that I am executing.
   You know how some things need a CON output window. Like in OPUS
   or Tools Daemon (you set WB or CLI) and if its CLI it opens a CONsole
   output for that program. 

   You see I am trying to execute a program startnet (AmiTCP) and it needs
   an output window!

   Thanx

   Tom.

Actually on most programs this works:

       p$="Myprog"
       Execute_ &Myprog,0,0
       end

(Hope This Helps A Bit !)

Nigel, Its me again.

I did however get this to work (but its slower???)

 p$="Myprog
 f$="NIL:"
 Execute_ &p$,&f$,0
 end
 
 This has an error because its wrong sytext. you dont need the () and `
 and you need an extra parameter (0) ?

Execute_ (&p$,&f$)`

Err...execute takes 3 args

Execute_ p$,<inputfilehandle>,<outputfilehandle>

so it would be Execute_ p$,0,0 (for NIL output)

When is BUM8 going to be realsed?

With the linked lists why not make them so you dont have specify a size 
parameter like : DIM LIST mylist (), So the every time you add an item 
the list grows until the the program runs out of memory as this is the 
whole point of linked lists. The only boundary of the size of the list is 
memory.

With some of the commands why not make sure the are totally bug free 
before releasing them and causing everyone some greif, as when you 
complie and rum some programs they like crash as the command is a bit 
buggy on that machine Richard Elmores Space$ command does not like the 
500+.

Also why not get the AGA dual playfield working (properly) so you dont have 
play with BLPCON or something like that first. and also why not get the 
width of initcoplist working as a parameter instead of playing with 
display controls.

Well thats that.

Also is ABC going to really be able to Cross-compile to different machines.

x2ftp is fast me for me though.

Does anyone know who you should contact for creating new aminet directories?
If we had a dev/blitz directory on aminet we wouldn't need these ftp sites.

  I'm not sure opening a console is enough in this instance... you need 
to be able to direct the output...

  I wonder if executing IconX with startnet as an argument would do the 
job...

  Here's my console code, anyway...

  If *conmp=0 Then *conmp=CreateMsgPort_
 If *conmp.MsgPort
  If *conio.IOStdReq=0 Then *conio=CreateIORequest_(*conmp, SizeOf .IOStdReq)
   If *conio
    *conio\io_Data=*mw0.Window
    *conio\io_Length=SizeOf .Window
    cd=OpenDevice_("console.device",0,*conio,0)
    *conu.ConUnit=*conio\io_Unit
   EndIf
  EndIf
 EndIf


*mw0 must be a pointer to a window.

Hope this helps...

No - the Space$ command throws a wobbly on pre wb2.1 (i think).  It certainly
doesnt work on 1.3 machines.  Its a bug i kinda menat to report, but sorta 
got forgotten (i discovered the problem whilst on one of my 'holidays' from
uni).

I used this in an assembler program a few years ago, if I remember correctly
you will have to supply an input & output channel to the cli as well as the
actual program path & name.

If you can't get it to work let me know and I'll dig out the old source and
try it in Blitz.

Try contacting the administator of the site a wuarchive, as all the other

Because the lists are designed for speed. Use RILinkedList libs for
a more conventional approach.

Thanks to all who helped it works fine with...

NoCli
p$="run DpaintIV:Dpaint"
Execute_ &p$,0,0
End

The run allows Blitz program execution to continue without stopping
until the launched process has finished.

We tried that months ago - and they changed it so, that one
directory was for AMOS & all other Basic things, including Blitz.
After that they have furthermore reduced the number of directories
in aminet, so I don't think we'll have a chance...

You're on the right track, but that's not quite the right way to go with 
it...  The parameters following the string to execute are DOS filehandles 
(there are two, an input and an output.)  If you leave these null, your 
program will use your own CLI for input and output if your program is run 
from CLI, or NIL: if run from Workbench.  Try this:

p$="Myprog"
Execute_ &p$,0,0


Or, if you want it to ALWAYS use NIL: for input and output, try this:

nil$="NIL:"
*fh=Open_(&nil$,1004)
p$="Myprog"
Execute &p$,fh,fh
Close_ fh

Though it seems like eons since I've touched the source for that library, 
I'll look into it-- Of course I normally no longer support 1.3 machines, 
in the case of a simple function like SPACE$ (which requires NO 
libraries) it should work... I think the problem may lie with the way the 
strings library was changed circa BUM5...

I have a G-Force 030 Board. When I compile a source with the
SPACE$-command, the program doesn't work on a 68000-Amiga (wb2.1 or 3.1).
I must compile without the G-Force, then it works.

Subject: Brining ANSI to a window

Hello,

 I recently painted a ANSI-Picture which I wanted to show in a window.
So I got several probs at once:

  1. When I compile the ANSI-Pic with Include-Util and then reload it
     via a$=IncText$(?ansipic), then the string a$ is empty. Why??

  2. How to print out ANSI in a intuition-window? Is it possible?

  3. Is it possible to open a CON: window by the program on an own
     screen and to get outputs (this ansi pic) and inputs from there? 
     The console-library which came with BUM 7 (afair) is still very 
     buggy - it crashes my machine.

can somebody help me?

oh, btw, I have a 4th problem

  4. What is with BUM 8 going on? In other networks they're even
     talking that BlitzBasic *is* dead...

Subject: Arexx in Blitz Basic

AREXX IN BLITZ BASIC
====================

Has anyone managed to get ARexx to work in Blitz Basic? On
an old BUM disk (you could argue that ALL the disks are old -
it's been such a long time since anyone received the last
one), there were a set of ARexx examples - bpaint.bb,
roger2.rexx, etc. ...

I cannot get them to work. They compile and run, but none of
the commands added works. The .rexx scripts do not return. 

I can affirm that the following has been done :
   - REXXMAST process activated
   - BPAINT program executed before rexx script activated.

I have a book called 'Arexx: Your Amiga's Built-in Turbocharger'.
They give C code of how to implement an Arexx port. The sequence
of processing looks nothing like that given in the Blitz Programs.
I have a feeling that that might be the problem.

The BB2 function GetRexxCommand() cpaitalises the command argument.
How do I arrange it so that it doesn't do that? Also, why is it that
rm_Args(1) isn't a string? How do I get a string from it - and will
it preserve the case of the command argument?


POINTERS
========

Blitz Basic 2 has a way of dealing with pointers which seems
different from C.

Type in the following program :
   NEWTYPE.mytype
      a.l
      *letters.s
   End NEWTYPE

   DEFTYPE.mytype struct, *ptr

   *ptr=&struct  ;see comment below

   struct\letters="how now brown cow"
   NPrint struct\letters
   *ptr\letters="and silly sow"
   NPrint struct\letters

   MouseWait
   End

Output is :
   how now brown cow
   and silly sow

By rights, the line *ptr=&struct is wrong. ptr is a pointer
t0 mytype, so it really ought to be
   ptr=&struct   (without the asterix)

BB2 only seems to give one type of dereferencing. Hmm... it
works, but C seems to have a uniformity of meaning that BB2
doesn't. Maybe someone could give us a tutorial on the BUM to
explain, conceptually, how BB2 interprets pointers.

  Hello Blitz people,

     Does anyone know if it's possible to make a dual playfield (or whatever
  they're called - with a bitmap in the background and foreground) which has
  two 4-bitplane bitmaps?  I've got it working with two 3-bitplane bitmaps,
  but when I change to 4 the screen just goes blank and none of the bitmaps
  are displayed.

  I'm using the Slice command (which may be redundant now but I don't know
  how to use the new DisplayLib thing).


  Thanks,


  Matthew.

<Not sure if this got through before, so here it is again.>

Ive just put a nice ListView gadget into my current program, with " Add "
"Delete" buttons positioned underneath.

Everthing went well until i came to put in the 'Delete' code.  I realised
that when you clicked on a ListView gadget the item under the mouse is
highlight then un-highlighted when you press and release the mouse button.

Is it possible for the item to remain highlighted until the user selects
another item or clicks again?  This means you can see exactly what item you
are deleting.

Commodore is selled to Escom. A 060-Amiga would be a surprise but it
is not impossible. Nothing is impossible at the moment. :-)
The first date for continuing the Amiga-line is September, but this is
neither sure nor definitive. They will continue the C64, A1200, A4000
(possibly with new case). The C64 is planned for the East- and China-
market. I'm not sure, if the A600 will also continue, but i have heard
something like that...

> amiga going to be made, what about the RISC based amiga`s ?

Nobody knows if it will be a HP-PA or PowerPC-based Amiga. Also not
Escom! They rethink yet, which processor is the better solution for the
future. Any other report of "definitive PowerPC-based" is a rumour.
But a RISC-based Amiga will come...

> is there still a future for Commodore...

Possibly not for Commodore Amiga, but the Amiga from Amiga
Technologies GmbH has a future. :-)

Well, look out in the comp.sys.amiga.advocacy and -misc newsgroups for
messages from Dr. P. Kittel. He is the new head of Engineering for the
Amiga.

At the ESCOM press conference on the 30th they said that 25000 A4000
are slated of production in September. 10000 would be 060 with a licsenced
Cyberstorm (phase5) card inside and 15000 plain 040. They also have said
they plan to sell 12000-13000 A1200 this year alone (these will be made in
september also). No prices were stated. They have also setup R&D in the
ol Norristown site and in Germany and are working very closely with SCALA
and Motorolla so a PPC amiga looks likely even though they said they hadn't
made a decsision on which processor to use. Amiga Development is
continuing. YEEEHHAAAA!
	They also said SCALA MM300 will be packaged with all Amigas including
A1200's. Look's like they're really pushing the miggie into the
serious/multimedia market.
