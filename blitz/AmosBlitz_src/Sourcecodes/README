Here are some sourcecodes of the games and programs I wrote in the past few
years using the BASIC languages "Amos" and "Blitz Basic". Do what you want with them -
the sourcecodes are public domain. You can find the compiled versions on Aminet.
Or take a look at my homepage:

If you want the sources of my other games "Marblelous 2" (Blitz Basic), "Lost On
Parrot Island" (Amos) and the games tool "Trainer Maker"(Blitz), please e-mail me:
