						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@...>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@...>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@...>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@...", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@...>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@...>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@... or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

Use the OS functions instead. I've attached a function to do this.

For a draw requester only set #ASLFR_DrawersOnly to True.

I always told to report bugs so this can fixed and not simple use OS
functions

Seem hopeless to get AB2 100% bugfree without your help because i cannot

Sorry, Bernd. This is a long standing bug in Blitz, and one that has been
mentioned on this list before, so I assumed that you were aware of it. Anyway,

I have a source which is a different size than yours, but fails when I try to
compile it (Wrong number of macro parameters) so I can't say what size the
compiled lib would be. If you want - I can send it to you privately.

The info at the top is the same, suggesting it may be a slight variant on the
one you have. The source size here is smaller, so I expect it would create a
smaller lib and probably isn't the one in the current distribution.

I think I did not have this problem before v2.4.

when the user is done naming/selecting a file with
the ASLfilerequester command, it works with the
debugger enabled, but not without it.

it freezes and boots without it.
I do not know why.

if this command is somehow outdated and there is
a better command that does the same, pls tell me.

Subject: @{b}Could you help me with this "problem" in blitz please?@{ub}

Hi,

Working on what was given to me as a test of the serial port to look for the
existance of a modem or midi (Derived from a ~modem responce).....

This is my latest project.

In a modem S86 can hold values set which are determined by HOW the modem was
disconnected.

This program is trying to get that value.

But it doesn't work.

Ok, the device is not the serial.devivce, but that is because I have a
hypercom3 card.

Could someone please help me get this part of the code working, then I can
move on to the decoding the value, opening a window and giving a reason.

Thanks in advance.

Cya!

Indeed, I have this version and it works quite ok (thanks Bernie!).
I use WinUAE now to find enforcer hits, main developement I do
on Amithlon. I hope there will be a tool like enforcer on Amithlon
in the future.

Sometimes I use WinUAE 0.8.17 for the classic chip set support, but I
much prefer AmiThlon.

Unfotunately I had no success in getting WinUAE 0.8.21 to work with my

You can turn on logfile to see what your cdrom Unit Num have

Yes I tried an amiga file system but it did not work. But I notice that
0.8.21 is up to r4 so I might give it another try.

I remember that the CD ROm support was broken in 0.8.21.x 
so dont worry about your CD Rom. I use 0.8.17 and this seems to
be more stable anyway. I think we have to wait for the next version
(which might have the enforcer-like-tool integrated).

@NODE "mail_18" " Group project "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 07-06-02 00:48:35
Subject: @{b}Group project@{ub}

Hi there, all

I know that there is a lot of experience and some very proficient blitz coders
on this list, and so, subject to a reply to another mail I've sent, I'm trying
to guage interest in a possible group project.

With the demise of Napster and AudioGalaxy, and with the Amiga Gnutella port
having been abandoned, there's a distinct lack of options for Amiga file
sharing.

I've been doing some exploring, and it seems that the Direct Connect client has
it's basis in Visual Basic. That being the case, and given that I (and
undoubtably others on this list) have at least a passing familiarity with VB,
and at the very least, we could read the damn code with some semblence of
understanding, I thought that if I could lay my hands on the Direct Connect
source, we could perhaps take on an Amiga port as a group project.

As I say, this is subject to getting hold of the source - something I'm working
on, but I'd like to know what the interest would be from people on this list.

Of course, some proper project management would be required, but that's just
detail that could be worked out.

So - who's up for it? 

All the best



Steve

Hello Steve

I am interessted in this project.
But I would suggest to write a complete new client.
I have already coded the networks subroutines
to connect to the GNutella network and to send/receive
requests. "Only" thing that is missing is a proper GUI and
the download management. If someone is keen in
MUI we could create a client not too hard.
Alternatively we could use some GUI library
I have created for HD-Rec (my project), it is MUI
like but created GTButtons.

Hello Steve

OK, so already two people who are interesstred in
this.

I could (and would) do all the network stuff and datatransfere.
I could also implement an internal player for mp3 files.
(this is very easy because I have already coded this
for other projects, see my homepage http://www.hd-rec.de
under "others".)
So I guess for you would be the MUI GUI stuff left.
And someone has to do the main programm calling
the network and GUI functions.

This project should be totaly freeware.

Lets see if there are more people out there who are
interessted in this.

That would have been one of the provisos for the Direct Connect project - so I

Well, we could do with at least one other to do all the main functions :o)

In my experience and view a project manager should never do any actual

Grumble, gagh, not these freaks again.

1) There's no site there any more (which is also why it's not on search engines)
2) I've tried to get them to stop.
3) I'll bet a lot of the people's addresses who were on the Blitz2000 site are 
glad I implemented a mailto form instead of just having their email address in the

You can't, it's just spam. Unfortunately. Some people should e-mail these
TrafficMagnet people and tell them that their mails just put people off
rather than generate customers :)

It's because of people like Christine Hall (if that is her real name, rather
than \\PC-01\ ;) that I've had to put a mail form on my site now rather than
a direct e-mail link.

That sounds a great idea.    How does one set up a mailto form?   I

others say my prog crashes at startup,
so that may be because of this enforcer hit.

the exe on aminet is compiled with
ab2.4 and not the latest ab2.6
so maybe a v2.6 exe won't produce this enforcer hit...?

I think no

The offset $17c of gfx base (current Monitor)was on this system 0
Wy this happen with what lib this happen i dont know
But normaly the current monitor must never be 0 



The Code that happen the hit was $28(a0),a0 
where a0 is the current monitor 

When i set my current monitor address to 0 i can not see a hit

Maybe you can clear the value and dont change the screen (because every

program to see which function cause the hit.It must a lib that add
something to startupcode.

The winuae with enforcer support is not offical (and  should never be) but i
or maybe a DSL User can send it to you if you wish

Im not sure what you mean with this.
isn't the enforcer hit caused by AB2 anyway?...

all I do is use the findscreen command.
nothing else screen relative.

you mean I should use a muguardian(or similar) program
to find where the hit appears?

The hit is in a Blitz library.But when getting the hit something is wrong
with CGX install.I dont know wy the lib need the current monitor.

I have aga and do not get the reported hit from my prog.

but I ran muforce, and used the debugger
while testing my prog, and I got this hit
several times while using the debugger.

and sometimes I got the below hit two times on my prog
while using the debugger,
and always when I just ran an executable of the prog.

but when I 'step' through the code manually,
It doesn't produce this hit,
so I don't know wich line that causes it.

The hits come when the disassembler win is open.close it and save
configuration
 
But i have now the debugger working so that it can debug programs that not
start 
from within AB2 Enverioments so i enhance it more because i can now use it
to debug ped and amiblitz 

To all

What features do you find usefull for the debugger in the future ?

Hello Joar

On 18-Jul-02, you wrote:

Make a AB2 programm with this line

Poke.l GraphicsBase+$17c,0

and start it.It has no negative effect



After that you should not switch the screenresolution or you need to start
this program again to set the value to 0

Putting this line in front of your program maybe not work when the hit come
in the init

I've made a system friendly diskmag, which runs in a screen and uses a

Here's what I want to know:

1. Is it possible to promote the display in an easy way to support CGX 
displays ?

2. It doesn't work in winua, what could I have done wrong?

If anyone wants to check out the source or the whole developer archive just

The attached code is to open a DblPAL screen in Blitz, but as long as you know
the ModeID, it should work for any screenmode. Replace the parameter after #DIS
($a1004) with the ModeID for the screen you want. The other tags are documented
in the Blitz manual.

There is a !screen_ Macro that open a screenmoderequester and then open the
screen.It allow to save the screenmode 

See the program in graphiccard examples blits.ab2.

Dont forget to add the all.res and image.res add to your program if you use

Hello  Torgeir

I would suggest just to use #SA_LikeWorkbench Tag,
so you can be sure the screen is displayable. If
you want to have a special resolution and colordepth
you should use the BestModeID command from cgxsystem.library.

Is that really all that it requires? I have yet to get that example to

@NODE "mail_51" " Limiting mouse (again) "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 07-22-02 15:49:53
Subject: @{b}Limiting mouse (again)@{ub}

Hi there,

Further to my earlier mail. I had an idea and went a different way with this.

Instead of limiting the mouse pointer to a specific area of the screen, I've
used input.device to set the mouse controller to none (#IND_SETMTYPE - 0), and
then set it back to 1 (standard mouse port) on exit. Coupled with setting the
pointer imagery to an empty image (effectively turning it off), and checking
for my window becoming inactive with a custom event handler (meaning I can trap
this with a WaitEvent) and forcing both the screen and window back to the
front, I can effectively lock the system from most user input until the
password is supplied (screen switching is also trapped). The only events not
trapped are hotkeys, but certainly here this is not a problem, since even if an
application is opened with a hotkey, it can't be used.

However, I still have a concern.

My routines to switch the mouse off here seems to work fine. BUT, I'm using a
PS/2 mouse plugged in to the Amiga Mouse port using an adapter. This way,
input.device still uses the standard mouse port for mouse input. I don't know,
but I assume serial mice and mice plugged in to custom controllers not attached
to the mouse port will be identified to the system differently. Is this the
case, and if so, how can I get the value of io_Data for the MTYPE before I
reset it (enabling me to restore it's orginal value)? Tring to read the value
of io_Data doesn't work.

Or - am I completely wrong, and drivers for custom mice simply patch
input.device to read them as tho' they came from the mouse port - in which case
it won't be an issue.

There may also be a problem if the mouse is plugged in to the joystick port,
'cos as things stand, when I reset input.device on exit from my program, it
would be reset to the mouse port.

Sorry to go on a bit - but what started out as a personal project for my own use
only is looking like it's going to make it to Aminet :o) 

All the best

@NODE "mail_52" " Limiting the mouse "
From: Steve Hargreaves <Steve@...>
Date: 07-21-02 21:41:52
Subject: @{b}Limiting the mouse@{ub}

Hi there,

Is there a way to limit the mouse to a specified area of an intuition screen in
Amiga mode without having to constantly poll and reset the mouse position
directly?

I've tried various things without success - setting the Viewport, trying to fool
the OS re the screen size by setting *scr\Screen\Width, Height, TopEdge and
LeftEdge but nothing seems to work. I had a look at input.library, but can't
see anything there that helps.

Basically, I open a window, and want to prevent the mouse from moving outside of
the window co-ords (which I get from the os .Window structure - no sizing
gadgets or dragbars are attached to the window, so it's size and position will
remain fixed, but there is a way that the user can get access to sizing/dragbar
under specific circumstances so I can't assume the windows size and position at
the start of the program (it's an MUI window - so size and position are
remembered).

Once the window is closed, I need to be able to restore full mouse movement, of
course.

All the best

Hi there, Thilo

On 21-Jul-02, you said:

TK> I think the OS has no function for this.
TK> What about using busy-pointer to disable gadget in this time ?

I've tried setting the pointer as busy, but it only actually works when the
window is active, which kinda makes it a bit pointless.

I have set up an MUINotifyApp so that an MUIWaitEvent can react and reset the
mouse position/active window/active screen whenever the window is made
inactive, but there is a slight delay. Testing here shows that if I move off
the window and right click, about 50% of the time, I can access WB menus -
which I want to avoid (it's a system lockout proggy). Although this allows
access to the menus, usage of anything launched is awkward (you have to click
gadgets/menus etc. on the 2rd program to do anything within the VBL that the
event is waiting) it's still possible for someone who is determined.

The way around it at the mo is to open a full screen, non resizable non
draggable window behind the active window, but this is slow, and uses more RAM,
especially if I try to give the illusion that WB is still there (grab the WB
screen and blit it to the 2nd window). What I want to do is just open the
window and lock the rest of the system out until my proggy releases it.

Regards

I think there's a bug someplace. It does use the correct font, but no style
is applied. This occurs both on my Amiga with OS3.9 and my PC using UAE with

Just checked something. Seemed odd to me that you'd apply a style to a font
when loading it. Checked WindowFont. There's an option to apply the style
there, and that does work. In the above case, you'd use this instead:

..
LoadFont 0,"topaz.font",16
WindowFont 0,1
..

Perhaps the style option should be removed from the LoadFont command?

OK - just D/L it and gave it a quick test ('til it timedout) - no crash, so it
may be that something else on their system is messing with it.

The code for a mailto: form is thus (if you have a crappy mailer you may
have to view this in plain text to stop it parsing the HTML)

<form action="mailto:whatever@..." method="post">
  Name: <input type="text" name="name" maxlength="30" size="30"><br>
  E-Mail: <input type="text" name="email" maxlength="100" size="30"><br>
  Message: <textarea name="message" rows="15" cols="30"></textarea>
</form>

The downside to doing it like this is that it uses the visitor's mail
program, so they might decide not to send the mail after all. Also,
typically the mail comes out in some weird encoding that is difficult to
remove automatically.

An alternative option would be to ask your webspace provider if they provide
a FormMail script, which parses the stuff for you. The HTML code to use it
is near identical, with only the "action='mailto:...'" bit changing. You may
also have to change the name attributes of some of the fields to match those
specified in the FormMail script you use.

Alternatively, if you have PHP support on your webspace, let me know and
I'll send you the mail-form I've done for my site

You don't think that "email-lookup-programs" will find this in your html
file just because you put it in a form instead of as a direct link?

If you want to hide it use some kind of cgi/php/whatever script instead.

Well no, but he wanted the code for a mailto form, so I gave him it :)

If the script outputs the mail address in any form then you can only make it 
harder to get the address not stop it.
The way to do it is quite easy if the machine that hosts the website can send 
mail. Simply the mail is sent from the web server when user posts the form 
data to the CGI script. This way the user will have no way of getting the 
mail address and thus there is no way that spamm harvester could get that 
either.

That's exactly what I meant by using cgi/php/whatever.

Hey David, you should really change your site url to the one of this email

Well, to return to serious things (not to say that spam is not serious!),
regarding the Steve's sharing project: you have my moral support Steve! No
really, you should have noticed that i'm not here frequently, and i'm doing
nothing more than reading blitz-list. The fact is that i have no time ATM,
and this situation is going to be like this for months :(
So i'm here to wish you best luck on this project (and to all others

I have no problem with that (or a wait a little longer - we've waited long
enough - a few more days before development starts won't hurt). At least, as
long as we are developing it, we'll know why there's no release :o)

According to the blitz manual, any string variables used in the fields command
must be initialised first, and their MaxLen must be set. That may be the cause
of the problems you have encountered.

Hi,

Can I create a proggie in Blitz using the SDSTCPLib that listens for
connections to a port and then acts upon it, etc.?

So for example, I start the proggie on the Amiga and it listens on port
2123, and then I use a client program on my PC to connect to that port and
send commands to the Blitz proggie.

I've read the SDSTCPLib guide but its all Greek to me :(

Nice to see there are still some sensible webmasters about.

I decided to start wreaking my revenge on spammers a few months back..got a 
free website with PHP included and wrote a little web page that generated 
fake/invalid email addresses..about 30 to a page, and then added a few 
recursive links to the script again.

I forgot all about it until I read your mail...decided to check the server 
logs, over 13000 poisoned addresses served up now..<snigger>
Maybe I should just change it so it lists all the Microsoft employees email 
addresses too, or is being too evil ?

Software suppliers are trying to make their software packages more
'user-friendly'.... Their best approach, so far, has been to take all
the old brochures, and stamp the words, 'user-friendly' on the cover.
