                    @{b}Introduction@{ub}

     I was working on one of my projects and i thought: "How can i create
     a BB2 shapes file without writing a lot of lines all the times?".
     So i spent some hours to write this simple program. OK, not so good
     its interface, but it is very easy to use and it works fine! 
     It simply load some iff brushes and join them saving the result in
     a BB2 shapes file.

     This program has been developed using BlitzBasic2 by Acid Software.

     See the @{" Usage " link SE_Usage} chapter about its usage.

     @{b}ShapeGen@{ub} requires:

     - OS2.0+
     - reqtools.library by (c) Nico Francois.
     - gadtools.library

     @{b}NOTE:@{ub} this program uses the 'topaz' font!

                    @{b}Usage@{ub}

     Not so difficult to use.
     Save your shapes as simple IFF brushes, using the same name and an
     index number (@{b}0 is not allowed!@{ub})

     All your brushes must be in the same resolution and depth. ShapeGen
     allows you to use AGA brushes too (depth=8).
     

     @{u}Example@{uu}

     MyShape1.iff ;Shape 1 saved as 'MyShape1.iff'
     MyShape2.iff
     ....
     MyShapeN.iff

     You can save all your shapes using an extension too but it can be
     the same for all your saved brushes.

     Now, quit from your favourite paint program and run @{b}ShapeGen@{ub}.
     The main window will appear on the WB screen.

     It should appear like this:

       In the @{b}FileName@{ub} string gadget you have to put the main filename
       for your saved brushes/shapes.

       In the @{b}Min Val.@{ub} string gadget you have to put the min index value
       for your saved brushes/shapes. This is the new feature of this version
       of ShapeGen. Of course, this parameter is optional. If you insert a
       value, shapes will be saved from 0 to maxval-minval. If the minval is
       omitted, well, the default minimum value will be 1. 

       In the @{b}Max Val.@{ub} string gadget you have to put the max index value
       for your saved brushes/shapes.

       @{b}Extension@{ub} is your brushes/shapes used extension.

       @{b}Output@{ub} is the output file name.

       @{b}CD@{ub} can be used to select the directory in which you saved your
       brushes.

       Once you have inserted all necessary values, you can click on the
       @{b}OK@{ub} button.
       All your brushes will be loaded in memory, then joined and saved in
       the output file.

       This is all.

       Now an example.

       @{u}Example@{uu}

       Suppose you have saved four brushes as:

       MyShape1.gfx, MyShape2.gfx, MyShape3.gfx and MyShape4.gfx.

       Now run @{b}ShapeGen@{ub}, click on the CD button and select the
       directory in which you saved your brushes. Now insert these values:

       FileName : MyShape
       Min Val. : 1 ;YOU CAN ALSO OMITT THIS VALUE...
       Max Val. : 4
       Extension: gfx
       Output   : RAM:MyShapes.gfx

       Click on the OK button and...voila'...all done!

       Since version 1.2a @{b}ShapeGen@{ub} saves the palette too.

       The new @{b}TEST@{ub} button is used to display all saved shapes.
       This button is generally disabled till shapes are joined and saved.
       If you click on it, a screen will be opened in the right resolution
       of shapes and the original brush palette will be used. To display
       next shape you have to press the left mouse key.

       The @{b}SHAPE INFO@{ub} button is used to call a requester showing
       some informations about saved shapes. This button is disabled till
       shapes are joined and saved.

     Ok, some bugs affected the last version and this was specified in the
     manual. Now, after 11 months, i decided to remove them from the program
     and now @{b}ShapeGen@{ub} seems to be very stable.

     I think this program needs no more features. However, if someone
     has some idea about improving @{b}ShapeGen@{ub}, please try to
     @{" contact me " link SE_Author}.
