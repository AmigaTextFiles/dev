                                V1.02
                                =====

                         Last Updated 29/12/94

   This library is intended to provide some handy functions which, although
relatively simple in nature, give access to some rather nice features.

   Currently in this library:

STATEMENTS
==========
      WOutline{x1,y1,x2,y2,HiLite,Shadow}
      WBevel{x1,y1,x2,y2,HiLite,Shadow}

FUNCTIONS
=========
      success=AddGList{Window,GadgetList}
      success=RemoveGList{Window,GadgetList}
      success=RedrawGList{Window,GadgetList}
      success=ChangeGList{Window,GadgetList1,GadgetList2}

   WOutline draws a Final Copy ][ like outline for you.
   WBevel   draws a funky bevelled gadget thing.

   x1,y1 is top left, x2,y2 is bottom right.
   Hilite is the hilite pen, 1 for WB2+   }_ Reverse these for 1.3
   Shadow is the Shadow pen, 2 for WB2+   }  (Obvious really!)

   With the gadgetlist functions, Window is the window number you wish to
affect.  GadgetList is the number of the gadget list that is to be modified. 
They are very self explanatory really - you can now add and remove gadgets
quickly with these functions.  When you add or remove a gadget the image on
screen is NOT updated.  When adding, simply call a RedrawGList after to draw all
the gadgets in the list, but for removing gadgets you need to redraw the entire
display.  When using ChangeGList, this process is done for you, an InnerCls is
called and then thee new gadgets are added.

   A quick note of acknowledgement - the GList functions were based on some code
written by Stephan Kortleven which was sent to the blitz-list.  He sussed the
removal of Gadgetlists, I just tidied it up and did the adding and redrawing of
them.  Cheers Stephan - I'd been trying to do these tricks for months!

Thats all.  The code is freeware etc.
