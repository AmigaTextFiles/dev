                               =================

                                     V1.05

                             Last Updated 7/1/95

   This library is freeware - copy it - modify it whatever - but If you do use
it I would like some form of credit given in the program/documentation.

NOTE: YOU MUST HAVE THE ELMORELIB LIBRARY FOR THESE FUNCTIONS TO WORK!
      PLEASE CHECK THE CODE FOR DETAILS.

FUNCTIONS
=========

   TextEntrySetup{GadgetList,FileName$,Shape}
   ==========================================

   The TextEntry routine uses two little shapegadgets for the up and down
arrows, and this little function sets up the loading of the Gfx for those.
The Gfx are contained in the file TextEntry.Gfx.  This function can be used
to load those Gfx by specifying the filename (including path) and the shape
number to load the up gadget into - the down gadget will be in Shape+1.
GadgetList is just a spare GadgetList that you have that the TextEntry window
can use.
   If you incorporate the up/down gadgets into your own shape file, then you
should not specify a filename - ie FileName$="", and specify with Shape the
Shape which you have loaded them as.  The two shapes MUST be kept in the same
order and next to each other.
    This function was changed in V1.01 so that it no longer changes the
Borderpens setting - this was originally set just for WB2+ machines.  It is
best if you always set it before setting up gadgets, for WB2+ it is

    BorderPens 2,1

and for WB1.3 it is

   BorderPens 1,2

   It is easy to set up a routine that tests for what ROM we are using with
ExecVersion<=35 (i think) for 1.3 and lower, and then it can adjust the
display correctly.
   If you cant work it out, such code would look something like...

   If ExecVersion<=35
       Borderpens 1,2
   Else
       Borderpens 2,1
   Endif

   TextEntryPostion{x,y,w,h}
   =========================

   This function will postion the window at the specified screen coordinates
with the specified width and height (actual window size NOT text lines.
   Specifying any of these as -1 will leave their values unchanged, thus leaving
those things as they were last left or as the default.  This does NOT need to
be called.

   result$=TextEntry{Window,Title$,EditText$,MaxChars}
   ===================================================

   This is the actual routine - Window is the Window number that will be used,
opening on the current screen.  Title$ is the title of the window, and
EditText$ is the text to be edited.  MaxChars is the Maximum number of
characters that may be entered.
    Please note that there can be a lag of the key repeat on slower machines
when using exceedingly large windows (on my 1200, 4MB Fast RAM, '020 it only gets
lagged if the window is full screen (640x256).  As it is unlikely these sizes
will be required, this odes not pose a massive problem, but I am trying to
optimize the screen updating part of the code - if anyone can improve on my code
LET ME KNOW!!! - I changed everything I can think in V1.01 to get it faster!

   text in correctly, draw gadgets ok, etc.

   versions then you'll know what I mean).

   V1.02 21/7/94

   Text update improved again.  Minor bug that occurrred when calling the
   routine many times removed.

   V1.01 29/6/94
   =====
   Text update improved - less lag in really large windows.
   BorderPens command removed from SETUP, so now you should set it up, and
   they will not be changed by the SETUP command.
   ESC now quits the editing window - ie hits Cancel.
