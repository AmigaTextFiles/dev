COPYRIGHT/DISCLAIMER
====================
   Dont worry about me!  the code is freeware - do what you want with it!
If you change anything for the better or create a related function that
you feel is useful - let me know and Ill put it in the file.  I hope to make
this a proper library for Blitz at some point but I have no idea how to do
it, so just put up with using the file for now.  If anyone wants to let me
know how to write a library - feel free to call me!
   By the way - I take no responsibility for anything that happens to you
or your computer or even your tortoise through the use of this file.  So there!
   If you really want to you could mention me in your program/documents.

INTRODUCTION
============
   This include file allows Blitzers to access the tooltype information
contained within icons.  It consists of one include file, which includes
five functions:

   success=OpenToolType{Filename}
   ToolInfo$=GetToolType{ToolType}
   success=PutToolType{ToolType,ToolTypeValue,Enabled}
   success=SaveToolType{Filename}
   success=CloseToolType{Filename}

   To obtain the information from the tooltypes you must first call
OpenToolType, and then use GetToolType and PutToolType appropriately.  Then
once you have finished you should call SaveToolType.  This will save the
info and erase the information.  You do NOT need to close the tooltype if
you call this.  If you do not save the tooltype, then you should call
CloseToolType to clean up.

   See the include file for more information

   There are two arrays that are required for this to work - and are shared
within the above procedures.  These, and all NEWTYPES all start with TT_.
Hopefully, this will prevent any clashes with your programs/other libraries.
