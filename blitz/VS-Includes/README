Credit me in your docs if you do use my functions - I'd like just a little
bit of fame!   Hope you find these useful.....

Remember to report any bugs (however niggly) to me (email address is
TiffanMO@phymat.bham.ac.uk) and let me know If youre using my stuff -
theres no point in my updating stuff If noone uses, so let me know
Im helping you and youll continue to find updates of these libs!!!
