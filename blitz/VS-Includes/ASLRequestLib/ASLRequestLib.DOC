   Well - here's another little include file for you Blitzers - one that
dispenses with the crappy built in aslrequester for blitz, and produces a nice(r)
way of doing it, and making it a bit more user-friendly.

   Three functions (well two and a statement but you know what I mean)

Pointer to asl struct = ASLFR_SETUP{X,Y,Width,Height}  (zero if failed)
File(With path)       = ASLFR{Window,Title$,Path$,File$,Pattern$}
ASLFR_KILL{}

The first one must be called at the start of the program to get things ready.
Then use the middle one whenever you want to get filenames.
And call the last one right at the end to free the memory.

Gosh - Lots and Lots.  Hmmmm - Well it was only ever intended for my use, but
I've tidied it up and it should work fine for the rest of you now.

If you use it then I might like a comment in the docs.....

And again, as with the ToolTypes Lib - which should now be in the IntuiLib -
anyone can convert them to a proper lib if they like - I really dont know how
to do that - YET!

I suppose I need a DISCLAIMER.....

Sorry - got carried away there!  Anyway - you cant hold me responsible at all
for what my code may do to your machine or whatever you do with it or anything.
And theres no warranty either so HA! Got you there Didnt I?  Eh?   Eh?
