						  Blitz Mailing List Guide
						  ========================

This guide is intended as an easy reference to the Blitz mailing list.

It contains messages posted to the Blitz mailing list during the month shown on the main page.

--- Administrative commands for the blitz-list list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-subscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <blitz-list-unsubscribe@netsoc.ucd.ie>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <blitz-list-info@netsoc.ucd.ie>
   <blitz-list-faq@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <blitz-list-get.123_145@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <blitz-list-index.123_456@netsoc.ucd.ie>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send an empty message to:
   <blitz-list-thread.12345@netsoc.ucd.ie>

The messages do not really need to be empty, but I will ignore
their content. Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<blitz-list-subscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<blitz-list-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@netsoc.ucd.ie>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my administrator at
hassel@acc.umu.se or my owner at blitz-list-owner@netsoc.ucd.ie.
Please be patient, they are a lot slower than I am ;-)

@NODE "Mail_0" " A Pointer (I think) question "
From: Tony Rolfe <edgewater@shoalhaven.net.au>
Date: 06-07-00 06:42:13
Subject: @{b}A Pointer (I think) question@{ub}

I currently have the following arrays:

Dim HeadString$(9)
Dim HeadColumn.w(9)
Dim HeadAlign.w(9)

These let me have 9 columns on the screen each containing the string,
aligned according to the align value, at the pixel given in the Column
value.

The problem with this is that I can only have one set of headings
active at any one time.     What I want is to be able to nest
reports such that each can have its own headings.

My plan is to redefine the headings as

NewType .HeadColumn
String.s
Column.w
Align.w
End NewType

Then 
Dim Heading1.HeadColumn(9)
Dim Heading2.HeadColumn(9)
etc.

The problem is...    How do I tell the common routine which set of
headings to process?

I thought of something like *CurrentHeading.l = &Heading1()
but I'm not sure how the common routine would process the columns.

Any thoughts would be appreciated...

Thanks

It would be easier to use something like:

*CurrentHeading.HeadColumn = &Heading1(0)

Since you know there's always 9 columns in the headings (or you could always 
pass that as another parameter), you could then do something like this in the 
common routine:

Statement doheadings{*CurrentHeading.HeadColumn, win.w}
  For i.w=0 to 8
	; i take it you're using something like TextLength to work out the position

	; Move to position calculated
	Move_ RastPort(win),x,y

	; Draw text onto window
	Text_ RastPort(win),&*CurrentHeading\String

	; Move onto next column heading
	*CurrentHeading = *CurrentHeading + sizeof.HeadColumn
  Next
End Statement

doheadings{&Heading1(0), 0}

Thanks for that, David.

I actually knew how to get the columns onto the screen.   I just
needed the syntax to handle the pointers.

I think the easiest way will be to do

Newtype .Column
String.s
Align.w
Column.w
end newtype


Then 

NewType .Heading
HeadingCount.w
Pad.w
Columns[9].Column
End Newtype

Then 

Deftype.Heading Heading1, Heading2, *CurrentHeading

*CurrentHeading = &Heading1
gosub common
*CurrentHeading = &Heading2
Gosub common
end

Common
For i = 0 to *CurrentHeading\HeadingCount
	ThisString$ = *CurrentHeading\Columns[i]\String
next
return

I'll give that a try tonight.

Thanks again

No, you must supply a temporary rastport and bitmap. 

That is, unless you are using the NewWPA8 patch, which doesn't require it. 
But
even with the NewWPA8 patch, it says you should set one up anyway, for
saftey.

Here is how I do it.

This is just some code snipped directly from one of my programs, but I'm
sure you can figure out what is going on.

Of course, not everyone will be running that patch.

I figured out where i was going wrong last night. I had been using an ASL 
requester to get the screenmode and used the width in that for the width of the 
screen, pixel array and the temporary bitmap. Which was stupid, as the screen's 
bitmap was obviously opened at whatever size is convenient for the card. I used 
GetBitMapAttr to get the width of the screen's bitmap after opening it and then 
used that size for my pixel array and temporary bitmap.

All seems lovely now :)

Thanks.

Just want to point out that the AteoBus uses standard PC cards, so the IDE,

No apps exist for it thats why, and driver support is limited. Blitz might give

Yeah, I'm now in the quaint little fishing village of Cellardyke, Anstruther

Was it you that went to Dundee Uni? Someone else mailed me from the list

Yeah, and since Be aren't planning on upgrading BeOS, it looks like a bit of
a dead end. Cool technology left by the wayside, or something...

Huh? You mean if Blitz is ported to BeOS? Can't see it happening! Besides,
it's more of a dummy's interface to DirectX as far as I can tell (which is a
Good Thing!), so the point would be lost on BeOS...

Surely its more of a dummies guide to writing games for the PC, graphics

evil :)

Yes, functions are in and a lot nicer. No more ugly '{','}' - just plain old
() now. Also, statement has gone, and you return stuff using 'Return' (was
AmiBlitz like that?)

Hey, I gotta make it look like there's a lot there somehow! But yeah, it's

Hi Mark

Please try :)

> ideas to go on!

Don't worry, the stuff that was good is in here too, its not all just criticism.

1) Pointers when using the built in types. There is no way to access the value 
at that address unles you create a newtype such as

newtype.byte
	b.b
end newtype
*value_at_this_address.byte\b = something

which is a pain.

2) Pointers to arrays (of unknown or variable size). Again, you end up creating 
a newtype something like this:

newtype.bytearray
	b.b[0]
end newtype
*ptr_to_array.bytearray\b[3] = blah

Don't know how you'd get around this in the language though.

3) Editor. Fair enough TED was sort of separate from the compiler, but if 
possible could you make a set of CLI tools as the compiler etc? The IDE would 
obviously be set up to use these, but it would mean that you could use any IDE 
you wanted. Which would mean making the debugger a separate program, which 
maybe had its own interface? Oh, no limited line length in the editor either 
please.

4) Functions/statements were cool, but yeah, its better that you only have one 
type now and you use Return to return a value from it (yes, AmiBlitz used 
Function Return <value>).

5) You know that the libraries sucked (having fixed number of libs etc) but 
your plans for the PCBlitz sound better - being able to create them in any 
language, not just x86 asm. However, they were easy enough to use (just stick 
the file in the directory and run makedeflibs) - PCBlitz gonna be similar or do 
we not even need the makedeflibs step? On a related note, don't save the source 
files as tokenised! ASCII rules :) Although having syntax highlighting (doh, 
you've got that) and some sort of quickhelp thing (showed parameters etc in 
title bar of screen) in the editor was very useful.

6) The debugger was good, although with some of the extras that the REDDebugger 
provided it was even better. Very simple to use which was nice. Unlimited 
memory view windows would be nice too. And you MUST be able to see the source 
when you are stepping through in files that have been included, i.e.

XINCLUDE "somefuncs.bb2"
Stop
call_some_func_from_the_include{}
NPrint "blah"
; etc

when you called the function, you would only get shown this source file and the 
cursor would stay on the call_some... line. You need to be able to see whats 
happening.

7) related to above, a proper project system would be good, instead of having 
to (X)INCLUDE everything. which would also probably require the forward 
referencing of functions (doh, notice from the screenshots you've got forward 
referencing) - even if you need to do a C thing and create prototypes first.

8) Linked list system was good, although maybe it would be better that they 
were unlimited in size. Or maybe even selectable i.e. Dim List blah(20) would 
give a list only able to hold 20 items, whereas Dim List blah(-1) would be 
unlimited.

9) mouseable labels were cool.

10) garbage collection was good when you just wanted to hack up a quick'n'dirty 
program, being able to free the memory properly by yourself was good for doing 
proper progs.

11) optimiser would be nice :) (for the Basic code parts, obviosly libs should 
be fairly well optimised already)

12) gotta be able to check if somthing succeeded. prime example in AmiBlitz was 
the window command. erally easy to get it to fail, but you had no way of 
knowing if it did. If possible commands should return a value showing if they 
succeeded or not, and ideally if successful would return a pointer (for the 
power users)

13) shared variables (in functions) were good

14) making up variables on the fly were good, but sometimes led to difficult to 
track down errors if you made typo's. Maybe keep the make up variables on the 
fly, but you have to define them with deftype. Or you could generate a list of 
variables in the program which the programmer could have a look at, since you'd 
probably notice a variable that was obscure or typoed in that rather than in 
code.

15) Unlimited parameters to functions would be good

16) Macros were good, until you realise that its a pain in the arse using ! and 
then {}

17) Can't make it out from the screenshot, but I hope you are using ";" for 
comments - it looke like ":"!

18) The ability to get the address of a function would be good.

19) Quick types were good

20) use the x86 fpu! and if possible support other cpu enhancements, like MMX 
(if there's any use for it these days) and 3dNow. transparently of course, 
don't have to specifically compile versions for AMD, just have something like:
  if this_processor_has_3dnow
	do_3d_now_instructions
  else
	do_normal_x86_crap
  end if

21) It's universally acknowledge that the Blitz manual was poor (although I 
liked the user guide, thought that was OK and people bitched too much). But the 
docs need to be really good, and correct :) with some good examples. Explaining 
the system would be good, such as in AmiBlitz there was probably an example 
that went along the lines of:

; Open screen
Screen 0,blah,whatever....

; Open Window
Window 0,0,0,640,320,....

But no explanation of *why* to open a screen or window. Fair enough you could 
say that people should know this if they are using screens/windows, but perhaps 
they don't. A lot of beginners started with Blitz, and they may not have a 
clue, or understand jargon or whatever.

22) residents and view newtypes were good as a quick reference

23) on-line help was good too, although the one that came with AmiBlitz had a 
very cut-down data set and wasn't too much use.

24) Dim'ming arrays on the fly, using variables as the size was good: i.e. Dim 
blah.w(my_size)

25) Long live BlitzDude and the "OKEE DOKEE" requester :)

I think thats all I have to say about Blitz, most of my other hassles are 
specifically with Amiga specific things in it. If I think of any more I'll let 
you know though.

We forgive you :)

> ideas to go on!

random thoughs:

Wrong with ted+blitz: only ASCII!  (That's because I'm french, I miss the é /
à  / è ... )

One thing I enjoy very much in ABlitz is the hability to press 'help' to get
the syntax of any command in the upper bar, in fact I like it so much I even
have the reflex from time to time on other languages (it never works :))
Despite this, I would have preferred the prog to be saved in ascii by default,
making things easier for multidocuments opening, or to use special editors. (On
the amiga the TED can't open multiples sources, you need to launch one ted per
source)
Is it necessary conflicting?

Don't know if you looked at DarkBasic, but looking at it made me things it has
the same problems Amos had compared to Blitz: It's blocked, I mean there is no
evolution possible because there is no library system, and also the interface
of executables is non standard, not an ounce of wingui stuff.
I think those reasons are the ones why there still are some blitz users, and no
amos users. 

I use the scripting language embeddeb in Macromedia's Flash4, and it's horrible
for various reasons, but there's one thing nice in it, it's the hability to
build reference name, ie you can do 'gosub a$+b$' so you can build strings
where to go like 'here1' 'here3' dynamically , which is very handy (at least
for me).  
Is it something so special to the way Flash is done, or could it be made in
blitz too?
 
The ablitz lacks a command line interface, you have to launch TED+Blitz to
compile. Although this never has been a big problem to me, it would sometimes
had been useful.

I'll maybe think of more later :)

Hi,

I agree with everything that David said, I'd just like to make one small
addition...

The online help was good, but what would be really great is if it were
able to easily add entries so that when adding a library you had the
help available - I don't just mean the addition of the comand syntax in
the title bar, although that is really useful.

Cheers,

Roger

Super Ted can open multiple sources can't it? I'm pretty sure that
whatever version I use it can do, but it's too long since I have used
it.

Maybe Spotty helps him with the other docs.

Offcourse this would be increddibly difficult to implement on a PC version of
Blitz since PC keybaords don't have help keys :o> They do however have "F1" keys
(That work pretty much in the same way), now someone PLEASE explain the logic in
that ?

Another problem I get from this reflex is that on my PC keyboard, the key
sitting where any sane person would have a help key is called "Delete". Darned.

I have a similar problem except I keep pressing the "Page-Dn" key (UAE "Help" 
key). Confuses me when you end up looking at a piece of code you weren't 
working on :)

OK, I'm gonna try and "reinforce" David's points, so you might take 'em more
seriously ;)

Yes, the new editor does look nice, and it's probably what I'd use (and I
mostly liked SuperTED -- I also used to use TED as my main Amiga text editor
;) but plenty of people wanted to use other editors.

That's one I wanted to bring up too! No limited line lengths! Please!

Yeah, functions only is better...

Yes, agreed -- most people on the list send source to each other in ascii
because of all the tokenisation problems...the editor sorts it out when
loading (well, as you know ;)

Definitely. BTW Are you planning a printed manual -- there have been several
projects trying to rewrite the Blitz manual, because it was terrible! Plenty
of people would be willing to help here (and even if it's only and online CD
manual).

Another thing I was gonna mention... :)

As long as the list is scrollable, and not fixed like in SuperTED!

Well, you could keep it "dumb" for simple success/fail stuff and just have
an Addr type command to get the object's poiinter...

functions?

Good idea -- the list of variables, that is...

The Blitz manual /really/ slowed me down to start with. Other people could
probably do a manual better than me, but I'll offer free proofreading
services :) Do you want this kind of assistance from us? We'll still pay for
our copies (well, I will ;)

Yep.

Yes, and as someone else said, should be user-expandable.

Yep.

I hex-edited mine to say "    OK    " :) Oh, and how about making that
skippable -- the number of times I loaded Blitz with a big source file, went
away, then found it sitting there waiting for me to press OKEE DOKEE before
it loaded the source...grrrr!

If libraries are to be numbered like in AmiBlitz, we need a central,
"official" database of which library goes where -- unless tokenisation is
ditched, in which case I don't think it matters, does it?

Right, I'll finally get Blitz over to UAE and see what else bugged me ;)

Like David said, there's plenty of good stuff about Blitz, but it's easier
to winge about the bad stuff ;)

I still like SuperTEd, but I've got used to golded now. Although I have changed

Yeah, good point.

Dumb could just be 0 for failure, not 0 for success. Then you don't need any 
annoying Addr commands :)

Yeah, something that checks if they are there and uses them if they are. I 
think an FPU is pretty standard now anyway, but Intels don't have 3dNow and 
AMDs don't have MMX or that new one thats in the PIII.

I never ever managed to get Blitz to load a source file from the CLI/WB - it 
always crashed :(

Maybe it's to do with F1 being similar to 'phone'

knows? ;)

Why not re-label the offending key to 'Help'? Some
Tipp-ex and a pen should sort that for you! ;D

I *have* to use them unfortunatly, due to the fact that if I don't and put

...and I ain't even gonna try putting them into functions/statements....way
too many variables that would need shared.

/me takes a deep breath....

1) Tokenising editor is nice, but it would be damn nice to have a command
line version as well
2) The whole deflibs/acidlibs thing is a touch nasty...I'd rather have lotsa
seperate libs (the "no deflibs" trick doesn't work for me)
3) The library numbers cause too many conflicts...it'd be nice to do away
with that.
4) *Not* using a custom file format for source files...just plain ASCII
would be favourite.

And far too many bugs in the Amiga version to count, including numerous
times those errors that the manual says "should never happen" pop up :)

Well, that's partly what I meant -- 0 fail. -1 or whatever for success, but

I meant a function that checks for FPU/whatever, and the programmer chooses
to use MMX/FPU commands to suit, rather than a single command that deals
with everything...

Here's a wish list I sent some time (years) ago.

A "Save and Exit" entry in the Project menu

A "Save" Option in the "This will erase modified file" requester.

User-definable increments in the "Insufficient Object Memory" requester.
I find 150% far too big (My object code is about 700K), but having to do a
"make smallest" each time is annoying.  Personally, I would like a
"Make smallest + 10%" or a "Make smallest + 50K" option, but others may like
a flat 150% or even 200%.

A standard way to put a Style-Guide compliant Version String into the program.

A Source-line-number interface to Enforcer

A Keystroke Record/Playback facility in the editor

The Auto-indent feature to shift the cursor one tab right after If, Case
Select, While etc and one tab left after EndIf, Wend, etc. (Two tabs after
End Select).

Please get rid of the "OKEE DOKEE" requester at startup (or at least allow
an auto-time-out - say 30 secs).  Then allow an auto-compile option so I can
double-click my source code icon, go away and come back to find it's compiled.

The ability to "Mark" a line and easily return to it would be good.  Some of
my .paragraphs are 300+ lines of code.

Return the Amiga-P for "Find Previous" as in old Ted

Make trace-backwards in the debugger obey the GS and PS buttons (I hate
stepping over a function or gosub and then having to backstep through it!)

It goes back to (at least) the 1960's editor with IBM OS (the
precursor to MVS) when F1 was the default Help key.

I can't remember the other F key defaults (was F3 cut and F4 paste?).

No No, Statements are good too.    Why return a value when you don't
need to.   I have  hundreds (literally) of statements of the form:
GET_CUSTOMER{CustNo, &CustRecAddress}

If they fail then they terminate internally.    What value should I
return?    If I have to return a value, must I test for it in case
something else comes back?    No, please keep the function available.

Yup I agree, except gosubs, which I did use a lot, but only because
blitz functions/statements were REALLY slow. When working with
time critical games, you couldn`t really use funcs/stats.
So maybe there is no need at all, but all basic programming languages
have a gosub/return function, its the law :)

Oh god yeah!.. Please please no line limits, that has to be one
of the most annoying amiblitz "features". :) It also impacted on
your executable size if you had a monsta line and had to hack
it on to one line (as with a lot of MUI stuff).

VERY VERY useful!. ASCII rules and so does quickhelp title bar thingie.

Yeah, I agree again, this is imperative :)
Some of the other features I liked about the debugger/reddebugger
Nice easy to edit/view display of registers,
Able to enter BASIC type expressions anywhere, even in the memory move
windows. IE, you could type *memory_somewhere in the memory windows
and it moves to the memory address pointed to by *memory_somewhere.
Same with all other places you can edit anything in the debugger, you
can always enter basic statements. This was nice.

Lists inside lists would be nice. Had to write my own library

Yeah that was a NIFTY idea! Maybe a button at the top of the label

Garbage collection RULES! (I`m generally lazy with that sort of stuff)

Personally, I`d love to see openGL support, I couldn`t really see
myself programming powerful games in DX (from what I saw of the
DarkBasic (www.darkbasic.com) demos running on my system).. They
were really slow. OpenGL goes like shit off a shovel on my voodoo3.
And it looks infinitely better than DX. But then I dont really
know a lot about opengl/glide/directx, something I should lookup
I suppose, and I will sooner or later :)
All I know is that OpenGL was written by the 3dfx guys for
the chipset on the voodoo cards originally, and that directx
games on my PC tend to be slow and look horrible.. But then
I haven`t had a PC for more than a month or two, so,... :)

If you want to atract more new-comers to programming in blitz,
then a good manual and set of online documents is a must.

I second that.
Maybe a system like the registry editor, where you can export keys
to a file and then double click the file in explorer and it adds
the modification, (or was that regclean).. Anyway, when the library
system is in place, people who write libraries are going to want
to be able to add to the main help system easily and without destroying
the sections of help that are already there. Maybe a system where
each library installed is in the index of the help, and the
person ammending the help system can add a new button which links
to the help file for their library/utility/plugin, etc.??
Or is there a blatently obvious, easier way to do it?

No no, there is no point in statements when you can just leave the
"return" line out of a function.. Erm, you are going to allow 
functions the ability to not return anything arnt you mark? At 
least thats what I assumed.

Hi Y'all,

Some good ideas here...

> 1) Pointers when using the built in types. There is no way to access the
value
> at that address unles you create a newtype such as

Pointers have disappeared from BlitzPC! Well, not really. Like Java, all
objects in BlitzPC will be handled by pointers. eg:

a.Alien=New Alien
a\x=Rnd(width)
a\y=Rnd(height)

So all object references will be via pointer. This doesn't solve your
pointer-to-int problem, though, but how often and in what situations is this
required?

> 2) Pointers to arrays (of unknown or variable size). Again, you end up
creating

This would be nice (function pointers too) and the compiler can handle it,
I'm just not sure about the language syntax.

> 3) Editor. Fair enough TED was sort of separate from the compiler, but if

I will eventually release the compiler/assembler as standalone tools, but
probably not with Blitz Lite. However, they are being devloped as standalone
tools.

A really good library system will be one of the goals for Blitz Pro. The
INCLUDE statement will probably be more like a 'use lib' type thing, and
will compile source only if necessary. In addition, a BlitzLibs requester
will let you pick blitzlibs to auto-include.

Source will not be tokenised, and F1 help-on-the-title-bar will be in.

Hmmm, haven't really done much debugger-wise yet.

The new vesion of INCLUDE will hopefully be enough to avoid a 'project' type
setup.  Your INCLUDEs will specify your project files - but they wont be
compiled unless they're out of date. See 5.

BlitzPC has a pretty radical List system - everything you create with 'New'
always appears in a list of the objects Type. Not sure if that'll be the
final word, but I way prefer it over AmiBlitz's clunky
currentItem()/pushItem()/popItem() setup. Here's some example code.

for k=1 to 100:
	a.Alien=new Alien
	a\x=Rnd(width)
	a\y=Rnd(height)
next

for a=Each Alien
	UpdateAlien( a )
next

Yes, but hard to do in Windows edit gadget! I will try for this though.

Hmm, not sure if I agree with that! Blitz will not have a garbage collector
though, so you will have to Delete stuff manually.

Yes, the variable-declarations-on-the-fly thing is one of BASIC's more
'interesting' features. It can cause some very nasty bugs.

How about this for a solution:

Variables may be declared on the fly ONLY if they are on the left-hand-side
of an assignment.

Eg, this is valid:

a$="Hello"    ;create variable a$

But this is not:

a$=b$            ;b$ not found!

Done. And sorry about that particular AmiBlitz 'feature', everyone.

I agree. A good library system will increase Blitz's longevity massively.
I'm waiting until BlitzPro to put this in, so I can take the time to do it
nicely.

The main reason you don't find this sort of thing in compiled languages is
because they like to know where everything is before the program is run. The
above is possible with some tables and stuff but would be fairly slow, as it
would have to 'look-up' the routine represented by 'a$+b$' while the program
was running. So that's a no, for now.

Well, all help will be in HTML so this is entire possible - as long as the
lib author supplies a help file.

Actually, this is a nice idea, and should make it into BlitzPro.

Actually, you don't need Enforcer, Windows will trap illegal memory
reads/writes, and you can still have a facility which tells you where in
your source code that a 'hit' occured.

If you just use 'Return', then Blitz will return a default value for you.
EG:

GET_CUSTOMER( 5,New CustRec )

Function GET_CUSTOMER( cust_no,cust_rec.CustRec )
	...
	...
	If something_failed Then Return
	...
	...
End Function

Is fine.

Hehehe :) Team17 have taken this Worms game WAY too far now. It was good for

Especially given that the game wasn't all that original anyway! :)

and if you type ARTILLERY on the WormsDC main menu, it instantly becomes a

And thats not what I meant :) Why return -1 and then need to use another 
command to get the address when it is simpler to return the handle (see Mark's 
mail) and just check for handle=0 (for failure) or handle<>0 (for success).

Perhaps darkbasic just sucks ass and is slow by itself, nothing to do with DX? 
Things about DirectX is that it isn't just a set of 3D routines. You have code 
for doing everything you need in a game - input, 2d, 3d, networking, sound, etc.

Nope, OpenGL was written by Sun or something, as an attempt for standard 3D 
programming API. The 3dfx guys wrote Glide, which was their (not exactly the 
same as OpenGL) implementation of it I think - but glide only works with voodoo 
chipsets. OpenGL should work with any.

Hi Mark

Thanks for replying.

Yeah, object references are fine. What about if you need to poke around inside 
some of the OS allocated stuff? Surely you'd need to use a pointer there? Or 
allocating some memory, although I suppose you could treat that as a "memory 
object". Sticking stuff in the memory might be trickier though.

Hmm, thats a question. Things like if you have read in a file straight into 
memory which is to be used as an array of ints. Pass a pointer (or two) to an 
int to a function, like the example you always get about pointers when you are 
learning C - for swapping values (although you wouldn't need that in Blitz cos 
it had the Exchange command). You're right though, its not too often.

Perhaps similar to variables? &function() to get the address and *function(). 
If you mean for declaring the pointer variable, you could do something like:

; DEFTYPE specifies the return type
DEFTYPE.Function.w *ptr(a.w, b.w, c.w)

I don't know, looks a bit crap doesn't it. But anything you pointed to should 
have the same parameters and return type.

Seems like quite a good list system.

My Windows GUI programming experience is through C++ Builder and not much 
either, but you can assign functions to mouse click events for most gadgets, 
what about sticking all the labels in a memo (read only text edit thingy)? Not 
sure how to get the mouse co-ords to compare against the text edit and 
therefore find what line/text you clicked on. You'd then be able to jump to the 
appropriate line in the code though. Hopefully. Ignore me if that's all crap.

Shared variables were how to access global variables. You had to type "SHARED 
var" to get access to the global variable inside the function/statement.

It makes more sense than just having variables being created anywhere in the

actually wanted to assign the value to.

I think it's better as just one function.  A normal function in PCBlitz would
look <something> like:

Function parser(opt1,opt2,opt3$,etc$,etc2,etc3)
  result=dostuff()
 Return result
End Function

whereas statements would now look like:

Function docalc(opt1,opt2,opt3$,etc$,etc2,etc3)
  dostuff()
End Function

then you could do combinations.  A function in PCBlitz sounds much more
logical.

Function docalc(opt1,opt2,opt3$,etc$,etc2,etc3)
  If opt1=0
	result=dostuff()
	If result
	  newresult=processresult()
	 Return newresult
	EndIf
  Else
	dostuff()
  EndIf
End Function

No! No lib identifiers period! The libs should be referred to by their filename 
and the only time this happens is when the compiler is figuring out which libs 
to include in the final exe. Mark has said sources will be saved as ASCII so 
you don't need libnumbers for the tokens (since there won't be tokens in the 
AmiBlitz sense). Syntax highlighting can be done without token numbers, all you 
need to know is a list of all the available commands.

How about having the "help" stuff included directly, inside the library
itself?

That way, it couldn't get lost, and could be automatically linked into the
existing help system.  Of course, the "help" part of the library wouldn't
be included in the executable program...

If the compiler can 'inline' functions, I would much prefer that to
gosub.  You get the good speed, as well as extra modularity.  As for
returning more than one variable from a function, perhaps something like
this? -

function bla()
  return 1,2,3
end function

a,b,c = bla()

Yeah, but then if a programmer has been lazy (yes, it happens! ;) you end up

Or possibly use two arguments
DIM LIST Thing.Thingy (a,b)
where a is the initial allocation and b the increment if you run out
of a (repeat b as often as needed).

How about instead of having a list as it was in amiblitz, have a tree
list of some sort - like netscape has for it's bookmark editor. You
could have standard entries for the functions but be able to add further
labels *within* the function label itself. This would keep all of the
associated labels together but not take up too much space.

Well you could do what they have done in mIRC, and add a detachable
group of buttons. Dont know if you have seen it Mark, but you have
got a group, where buttons are placed when you join new channels
or get/send DCC requests, etc. But you can drag the bar and place
it at top, bottom, left, and right of the screen. Dont know how
easy this sort of this is to do. Or even if it is a problem with
the windows edit gadget? Oh well, just an idea :)

Not really,

a gosub 'remembers' whre it was called from, so that the return place is
always correct. Also a gosub can be made recursive, without you having to
remember ALL of the return addies.

NO!  Gosub returns to wherever you called the routine from, so it can
be accessed from anywhere in your program.

Just like a function, with the exception of the local variables.

It is the equivalent of a machine-language JSR instruction.


GoTo, on the other hand, always goes to one specified place in the code.
 
> Isn`t a gosub a bunch of gotos in disguise anyway?

Well, as you can see from the explaination, it is different only in the
ability
to return to any location in the code, rather than just one pre-defined
location.
But this is a BIG difference.


Oh, and BTW don't EVER use GoTo to exit a routine that you have GoSubb'ed...
Right, James?    ;)

Not exactly.   It is a goto and save the return address (and probably
push some registers onto the stack)

BTW Have you ever tried an MC-505? I want one (I used to want an MC-303
[hence BeatBox], but the reviews I've read all say the 505 is way better). I
do know most of its limitations (and why some people hate it), cos I've done
a *lot* of reading on it, but just interested what you might think, being
the resident electronic music guy ;)

For asm

gosub -> JSR label
goto  -> JMP label

JSR puts the address of next instruction in stack, which it can be read
and then writen to PC (program counter) using RTS.

In basic goto is for alternate routing like "if ... else ... endif" and
"select ?  case ? case ? ... default  end select" stuff.
Gosub is for subroutine stuff like functions. the only difference
for normal functions is that gosubed subroutines doesn't use local
variables (=stack space for variables, which are freed before the function
returns).


Stack in gosub type subroutine:
 Free stack space, ReturnAdd, ... main program stuff


Stack in function type subroutine:
 Free stack space, Var5, Var4, Var3, Var2, Var1, param3,
  param2, param1, ReturnAdd, ... main program stuff

Hi All,

Here are some of my thoughts on the subject:

1. A+5 adds 5 to A. Brilliant !
2. Linked lists should be dynamic, and you should be able to add either as many
items as you want, or a fixed number like David suggested.
3. The editor only accepts ASCII-7 charecters, being a dane, not being able to
write Ã¦, Ã¸ and Ã¥ is a serious handycap ! Esp. when one of the charecters is in
your name !
4. Syntax highlighting ! Good Idea ! But everyone has it these days, and it
should be more flexible, like Hotdog Professional. (a HTML editor for Windos).
5. "On-line" help system, also quite good, but still plenty of room for
improvement !
6. Raster at the top of the screen ! :o> (On older versions of ted) Brilliant !
7. Support for MMX and SIMD instructions. (Compiler option)
8. NETWORK support, TCP/IP will do nicely for starters, or maybe DirectPlay ? I
don't know much about how this junk works on PC's....
9. Allthough you probably know this, judging from the screenshot on the website,
you should be able to define high and true color screens, and PLEASE don't
assume everyone in the world has highcolor, some high performance boards are
truecolor only !
10. Direct memory access, and inline assembly ! Great Feature !

That's my thoughts, more might come along later !

Yo!

Thanks for everyone's comments.

I'm trying to build up an overall picture of what people want, and this is
what I'm getting:

* Gosub will remain.

* There will be a command line version of Blitz in the Lite release. Many
comments were made about Ted - mousable labels, tokenizing etc - and I don't
wont to get too bogged down in the editor (one of the mistakes I made in
AmiBlitz) so this will allow you to use any editor if you don't like the one
in Blitz.

* There were lots of comments about the library system. Blitz Lite will not
use a library system, so this is all up in the air for now. However, I can
make the following promises about BlitzPro libs: there will be no lib
numbers; you'll be able to write libs in Blitz, ASM, C whatever; there will
be no makedeflibs.

* Regarding MMX/AMD extensions. These are (apparently) built into DirectX,
so there should be no need to mess around with these in Blitz. However, the
inline Blitz assembler MAY support MMX.

I've had lots of requests for the Blitz test. I'll send it out later today
to people who have requested it so far, but that'll probably be it for now.

I'm may be entering a 'quiet' period too...time to get back to some serious
programming.

Yeehaa!

Yay! But didn't you say that was gonna cause serious hackery?

Feature request/massive Sibly-time-saver: maybe a "compile source from
clipboard" thing would be handy in that case? You'd do a "Select all" from
the Edit menu in whatever editor you use, hit copy, then just do the
"compile from clipboard" in the Blitz compiler. The source would need some
kind of identifier, so no-one ends up trying to compile a JPEG, but still,
it's instant, no-hassle integration!

Yay! Again! But could you explain the planned differences between Lite and
Pro for us please?

Well, no "yay" here since I'm not an ASM programmer ;)

That gets a "yay!", but I'm off to bed (4:03am in the UK now -- I'll test it

Damn right! I want to do the same, but I need a decent Basic for Windoze

What keeps me from developing on linux is this dammed c stuff. It needs a nice

Oh too bad. Opengl would be much better imho, especially considering
portabillity. No BlitzPC for me then :-( I have a pc which is quite new(cheap

or steal any of that shit) and runs linux and soon may be running qnx. All I
lack for development on these os`s is a good non c environment.

Ah, but C is what I went for when I had to stop blitz due to a faulty amiga.
I might be getting an amiga soon tho, but with only 2 mb of memory :(
	(Anyone have a cheap accelerator available, or know where to get one,
	 preferably with memory?)

Anyway, after blitz, C isn't too hard, and you learn some tricks which you
can later use to effect in BLitz, because Blitz is rather versatile :)

Yeah but even games need os stuff, like maybe specific installer stuff
mode change requesters. etc etc.

I think if a GUI system can be done well it will be a great for the
programmers.

Especially since VB sucks so much ass.

You are taking the piss arn`t you?
Visual basic is NOT the tool to write apps in these days,
And I could probably list about 30 reasons why not to use it, but
I cant be arsed :). Delphi5 is a good application language, but it
costs £3000 or something stupid like that.

The trouble with writing gui support into BlitzPC is people will expect it
to have an appgen-IDE. Personally it doesn`t bother me, appgen-IDE`s
make for slower, larger exe`s, but it does dramatically speed up
development.

If you do put in GUI support, probably not a good idea to worry about the
IDE,
just let the programmer do the work, unlike with VB, where you just click a
few buttons and out pops a text editor :) hehe.

> these days
> anyway

Yeah but theres only so much you can do for game stuff, maybe a GUI
system last? The Blitz GUI creation system was supprisingly good
I thought (in later versions of blitz.) :)

Feature requested! :)

Having just upgradged my pc, I was AMAZED by the differences between
software directX based rendering and opengl/glide rendering on my
voodoo3. If possible, support for opengl/glide would be great!

aw god! for the love of good if you add support, then make sure it's NOT
for glide. Glide is on it's way to the morge. supporting opengl such an TNT
and
GeForce cards are the way to go. Having had both a 3dfx (and a ton of
friends
with them) and then a TXT to finaly upgrade ot  Geforce ... I know how lousy
glide is. Then having done some 3d programing on the PC also showed me what
NOT to do... Just my two cents...

Of course, what would be Really nice would be source-code
compatibility with Amiga Blitz!!!

I appreciate that would be difficult, but it would open up new markets
to Amiga Programmers.

The library system would have to be able to cater for features not
available on the PC and the use of direct system calls could prove
very tricky to emulate.

But it would be wonderful.

Or maybe a source-code converter???

Just a thought

Hi all,

I'm just surprised by the enthousiasm to give advices for the BlitzPC
development. They left the Amiga community and now it seems they try to use
our REAL BLITZ experience and advices to sell a BlitzPC.

They promised no quick variables, no mouseable labels, no ..., and no fun
("Okee dokee" not professional enough :)

I wish Fred will at least use the given advices to improve PureBasic which
already works on our Amigas and give good results.

I don't blame any initiatives I think that's a pity to see the list becoming

Please don't talk such utter crap. Nobody's using anybody. If people are
happy to help with ideas for the new Blitz, that's their business entirely.
BTW Fred's doing a PC version of PureBasic. What a traitor, eh? (Note to
Fred: sarcasm, not aimed at you!).

The reason people left the Amiga is because it's no longer profitable.
People can't be expected to put all that work in for nothing. Only a PC
version would make any money. I'd love to still be using the Amiga OS, but
the rest of it is just too far behind to be of use for most people's
needs...and it won't be developed or supported anymore by Amiga.

And talk about "REAL BLITZ" is just nonsense. The PC version is being made
by the guys who made the "REAL BLITZ". I think they can lay claim to making
the "REAL BLITZ".

Sorry, but zealots really piss me off.

Agreed, the amiga OS is lovely, Windows is lamerfied and bloatware. But both
have their advantages and disadvantages. If the way to get ahead these
days is to program for windows, well, I dont want to be stuck in the past.
It has been a real eye-opener since I brought this PC.

Damn straight!

I was waiting for this mail, I knew someone would say something :/
That is the only trouble with this list, many people here dont like
it when others leave the amiga scene. The way people have been
verbally attacked for moving to the PC in the past is really
very bad. It is upto the individual which platform he/she programs for
and if this list wants to aid the development of BlitzPC, that is
up to them!! Not you!

Yes, I am glad to help myself.  Although I don't currently own a PC, I will
in the future. As will all of us one day.

And it will be good to know that there is a familiar programming language or
two available on it.

And don't forget, if it wasn't for Mark and the rest, this list wouldn't
exist in the first place...

I am glad to think that they may finally make some money from their efforts,
and Fred too.

Wouldn't it be really lovely if either of the PC Basics being
developed from AmiBlitz had an AmiBlitz source conversion aid so Amiga
Programmers had a chance to port their creations to a major market
without all the hassle.

All what I learnt about BlitzBasic comes from the list. And I thank you for
the great help you broadcast. Thank you, Curt, James, David and all others.
Sincerly.

>  Although I don't currently own a PC, I will
>in the future. As will all of us one day.

It's the difference between us : I think the PC won't be a unique choice. I'm
not an Amiga fool fanatic, but just a really Amiga enthousiast.

Mark Sibly created the Blitz Basic and I want to congratulate for this. It was
a great and well sold product. I know the situation of the Amiga market is not
very large, and some companies left this market with this pretext, and in
another hand thet stopped months before to improve their products.

I still write articles about Blitz for a french paper. I use Blitz and I help
users to develop with Blitz. But what I said in the previous mail was I'm
surprised to sea Mark reappearing. If Amiga Blitz Basic was still officialy
developped here, it could be a great professionnal programming package.


>And it will be good to know that there is a familiar programming language or
>two available on it.

I understand, but please, understand I could be disapointed. I think our Amiga
is not dead. I don't blame those who buy a PC, even if I would wish another
choice :)

>And don't forget, if it wasn't for Mark and the rest, this list wouldn't
>exist in the first place...

I know, and I fully respect the work, but it's not an sufficient reason for me
to buy a PC and a future PCBlitz copy. The feeling won't be the same, but
everybody is free to chose to help Mark in his new development. I judged
nobody.

>I am glad to think that they may finally make some money from their efforts,
>and Fred too.

It's what we wish to every body here who take the risk to launch a product.

I realize my first email was maybe not a good idea ... and I don't know if I
explained me too clearly.

I won't criticize any topic any more.

I agree - the Blitz-List has only been an Amiga specific list because of the
background of the language itself.

If anybody want to set up their own list 'AmigaBlitzBasic' where PC owners
are outlawed, then I'd be interested to see which members remain on the
Amiga/PC list and those which leave.

As for it being "a pity to see the list becoming active when a PC topic
comes", this just goes to show that there are many BB enthusiasts that also
own (or have to own) a PC. It is a pity, only in the sense that the Amiga
hasn't really been able to keep up with the advances in speed and technology
that the PC has.

As other people responding to this thread have suggested, it will be great
that Amiga Blitz developers have a way that their work can be more
widespread. The only one thing that I hope is that the Amiga background of
Blitz Basic brings with it the highly commendable 'Amiga Community' attitude
of being willing to share their work with others (without it being necessary
to charge £10 to disable the crippleware, or £20 to view the source). It is
this public spirit that makes this list as popular as it is, and hopefully
not the actual link to the Amiga platform.

Exactly. If I could run all the latest games (I never was that bothered
about them on the Amiga. Now that I've been able to actually try them, I
like 'em!), encode mp3s and do audio-editing at reasonable speed, view any
website I go to, play RealAudio/Video, etc, etc, then I'd still be on my
Amiga. I still prefer the Amiga's interface, both Workbench and from the
programming side (though I haven't had to program Windoze yet, and don't
want to. I'm waiting for Blitz on Windoze and QNX Neutrino (see, it's cool
having a standard PC box) for serious stuff :) but the sad fact is, I can do
so much more on a Windoze PC -- in spite of Windoze!

Yeah, but I think that will continue on this list, even if people do manage
to make anything saleable in the new Blitz Basic.

Yep, agreed. If you make a game that sells, it would still do no harm to
show others how you achieved certain tricks, with code snippets, etc. If
it's free anyway, there's no harm in making the source available freely too.

> this public spirit that makes this list as popular as it is, and hopefully
> not the actual link to the Amiga platform.

I've heard about other PC Basic programming lists (maybe someone mentioned
it here actually), where people are more out to show how great they are, and
put others down as "lamerz" etc. I don't think that'll happen here. We'll
keep it this way!

Oh, and Mathias: apologies to you if I was a little "sharp"! I understand
your reasons for not wanting a PC box (I've been there), but hopefully you
can see that it's not some evil corporation out to steal Blitz from the
Amiga or anything like that -- it's the only logical progression in the real
world!

Yeah, WinUAE is surprisingly useable as an alternative to a real Amiga (I
have nowhere to set my real Amiga permanently). It's like having your
accelerator removed speed-wise (I get bare A1200 speed on a 200MHz thing),
but still feels right, and you can run almost anything. Plus you get as much
memory as your PC allows, and with Picasso drivers installed (an absolute
MUST -- it sucks otherwise!), you get a more powerful graphics card than any
Amiga card, assuming your PC's card is less than a couple of years old.
Slowness and slight instability are the only problems, but I'll report how
it runs on a K6-II 550MHz in a few days ;) The thing that really makes it
for me is that it uses folders on your Windoze drive for its own drives and
directories -- you can copy stuff between the "Amiga" and PC just by
dragging and dropping in Windoze, which means you can use Amiga programs to
generate graphics (or whatever) for use on the PC side if you're really
attached to a particular program. I use a drawer buried in my UAE setup to
store all graphics I make in -- with a shortcut on the desktop, you can just
open it up right there, save to it easily, etc. Hit Update in the open Amiga
drawer's Window menu and there they are :) If you have it set to use the
full screen, there's NO WAY to tell that it's UAE (apart from the speed ;)

Unfortunately, the author has decided not to continue with WinUAE (though
others may take over). Just waiting for his last release now, at
http://www.codepoet.com/UAE/index.htm.

OS stuff is unlikely to be at all portable, since PC Blitz isn't gonna cover
the OS side of things. By the look of it, though, it should be relatively
easy to port stuff made only with the built-in Blitz mode commands, though I
don't think many of us use those anymore ;)

I've made the mental adjustment to PC Blitz being a games Basic in the way
Amiga Blitz was in its early days, which I don't think is a bad thing at
all, considering the alternatives on Windoze. I'm really looking forward to
it :)

A simple program written in AmiBlitz could do a lot of it once we know the
format of the new Blitz's commands...of course, it would still need a lot of
tweaking by hand, but you'd get a lot of it out of the way...this isn't for
Sibly & co to do, though.

If Mark is here, can you tell us what plans you have regarding 3D (you did
mention it)? There were 3D commands (or descriptions) hidden in Amiga
Blitz -- is this the kind of thing we'll be looking at? How in-depth do you
plan it to be (like, full textured mip-map bip-bop anti-aliased
texel-twisting blah-blah, or simple solid vectors)? And will it be easy? :)

I'm planning a 2D game to start with, so I'm not too bothered, just
interested...

Forgot to say -- BeOS is nice, but there's nothing to do (kind of like where
I live). The speed increase over installing it on the Windoze partition will
be minimal at best, and you can access your Windoze partitions easily that
way anyway -- right click on the BeOS desktop and mount it by selecting it!
You can install programs and everything else in a drawer on the Windoze
partition anyway (and it's best to do that from scratch, since BeOS 5
(download version) uses its fixed 500Mb default partition for virtual
memory, which is badly affected by stuff going on the same partition). Be
shuts down Windoze and reboots to run itself, so you still have full control
over the box itself...

The stuff they bundle is impressive (there's a full CD burner in there for
example!), but I hardly run it at all now (I thought I'd use it a lot more
when I first tried it). Like I said, there's nothing to do!

Well yes...but as far as I`m aware this list had mostly dealt with amiga os
related topics, and things like mui, gadtools, arexx etc. Hardly any of it
would apply to a pc version anyway...unless I`m mistaken ;)...I`m pretty
sure most people on this list have a good grasp of basic...and any problems

Keep ya hair on...I own lots of pcs..and lots of amigas...I have to work on
my pc to earn money..and I program and use my amiga for pleasure! (no rude
jokes plz). And if you did have two lists, you`d probably have people joined
to both rather than just the one. I don`t know if you`ve ever joined a pc
programming mailing list, but in general they suck, and are full of
idiots...which make it pretty useless in the long run...unlike this one, in
which people can ask the same questions over and over and nice people who
know the answers reply again and again..with complaining...so think yourself
lucky your in good company that the people on here can actually answer your

Well I agree with Mathias on that one...and he also pointed out that when
Fred was talking about Power Basic for both the amiga and the pc, he never
got this much response. I understand that everyone wanted to have their say
and share there want lists about blitz basic, but I thought everyone`s list
were the same thing we`ve been wanting for years on the Amiga version...so
why didn`t ya all suggest them to Fred?? As far as I`m concerned blitz is
the only language that I use on the Amiga, developing with something else
would take far too long for what it`s worth. And on the pc side, I use C++,
Java and Delphi...and I doubt that will ever change so BBPC wont bother me
one way or the other.

LOL....I think that is highly specific to the Amiga community :).


Anyway, good luck to Mark with blitz pc...it`s a tough market to break into
with a lot of competition at the moment with products like div 2 and jama3d
(or what ever it`s called by that guy who wrote amos).

I agree with that, since the language will change a bit for Blitz PC. However, 
it isn't specifically an Amiga specific list, thats just a bye-product of the 
language only being available on Amiga.

> plz). And if you did have two lists, you`d probably have people joined to both

Yeah, you can't deluge people to stuff they're not interested in by default. 
People that only use Blitz on the Amiga wouldn't really want to get BlitzPC 
stuff, since the language will be slightly different etc as you mention above, 
and the traffic would probably increase due to the number of PC owners. PC 
owners probably wouldn't want to get AmiBlitz stuff, since they'd never use it.

> I don`t know if you`ve ever joined a pc programming

Jamie <something> mentioned this about dork basic :) Sad but true, more people 
makes it more likely that a few will be assholes. In fact, I'm sure that its an 
exponential thing, getting to the point where every new member that joins is an 
asshole :) When the Blitz list was more popular, there were a couple here too.

I think most of it (the language related stuff anyway) was suggested to Fred, 
or he knew already. Mark has probably forgotten :) Most stuff suggested for 
BlitzPC was really nit-picking or general agreement, not proper suggestions.

After all, Fred used Blitz around the same time as he was coding PB. PureBasic 
already beats most of the things that was suggested for BlitzPC and Fred has 
done an excellent job with it.

oh no..they`ve got to you too...this reminds me of the invasion of the body

to mean more to the Amiga...I have nothing against anyone talking pc
stuff..as it`s the way of the world...I just think it`s weird to think of
blitz disjointed from the Amiga. I could argue that blitzbasic2 is just an
Amiga programming language, as it`s just (very good I hastly add) a version
of basic. I think it`s the same as I don`t see much on the delphi list about
pascal...more about how to fudge something in winblows to work around os
`features` than anything else. I just wonder how portable the specific blitz
commands are, not the standard basic commands but other things like display,
screens, windows, gadtools, blitzmode...shall I continue?? hehe

I agree with that...but would you want to be packed in with a group of pc
programmers...all trying to second guess how to use com and active x?? It
depends what happens with blitz on the pc...if you need direct access to
directx and stuff..it`s going to turn into a pc programming list,
anyway..don`t ask me..I`m not the chemist. Unless you can do everything by
using a specific blitz command, then you have to know how to control the os
of the system, and as this is usually the hardest part..this is where most
of the help is needed ;).

Yeah, definately, its the same with all systems, even Amiga/Blitz2.

> Apologies to Fred for misnaming his basic...well I knew it began with P...I

It was originally going to be called PowerBasic but something
happened...PureBasic sounds better anyway, PowerBasic is like when people wanted
to call the new Amiga "Pheonix" - too obvious and cliche-ish IYSWIM.

Ooh! Slapped wrists, PB is up to v1.48 and I think it's fairly stable for Amiga
68k and PPC. Sadly I don't have enough spare time to use it. Fred has been working
on a PC/x86 port which is coming along nicely last I heard - create simple windows gui
executables with 6kb programs - nice :)

There is a mailing list for it and I don't think its become too ingrained with
OS specifics yet (and its pretty quiet) as the source is pretty portable. I
can't remember if the list is for registered owners or just everyone, depends on
how Fred distributes the updates, but I'll check and post the url/email here
later.

The list is on Topica - basically a small version of eGroups, it works in a 
fairly similar way.

http://www.topica.com/lists/PureBasic/
PureBasic-subscribe@topica.com

NB, in the description it says "PureBasic is a programming language for the 
Amiga computer" - I'm sure Fred has just forgotten to change this since he 
started the list, or is too busy working on taking over the world or something.

Also, the webpage is at http://www.citeweb.net/fantaisi/ although v1.48 has 
been released, so its a little out of date.

Anyway, I'll stop banging the PB drum now :)

I don't see anything there about the Windoze version -- does he have
anything about it anywhere? Might be handy for the GUI stuff (though if I

Don't know, can't remember where I got the information about the Windows 
version, but it was in an email that Fred wrote. Maybe to the Blitz list a 
while ago?

It is quite pricey, but maybe the PC version would be cheaper, bigger target 
audience all all that. And its more portable than most other basics, although 
it is only for 68k/PPC-Amiga and x86-Windows.

Fred had looked at a Linux version I think, although creating the libraries to 
deal with the 5000 or so different window systems would be too much work. I 
think he even contacted Amiga Inc about being an officially sanctioned basic 
for the new Amiga.</grapevine>

I think I paid about 40-50 quid when I got Blitz new, cos I got it just after 
it came out in '94 or whenever :( The thing I find funny now is people selling 
the CD 2nd hand for 15 quid when you can get it for 10 new (if you can still 
get it that is).

The only possible problem is that, as many think, PB is a little highly
priced (sorry!) -- BlitzPC will be only around £20/$35-40...it's only for
game programming for now, so you could probably charge more than that, but
not too much. Just My Humble Opinion!

Agreeded. I think many more people would buy it if it was a little lower
priced.

Using the blitter chip no speed improvement would be seen.  If you switched over

Hi Blitzers

I've just started coding a game in Blitz and finding it too slow decided to
take a look at chunky graphics.

My questions to you learned and most helpful lot is, is chunky graphics any
faster than planar when coding for AGA and an '030 without a graphics card?

Would the use of Mildred allow me to retarget my game for a graphics card at
a later stage?

And the last question, and the most important at the moment is having had to
come out of BLITZ mode to use Mildred how can I find the coordinates of the
mouse since MOUSEX and MOUSEY no longer work?

Hi Lazarus2000

I've heard that its not. But of course it depends on how much and what type of 
effects you are after. Doing c2p with an 030 will definately reduce your frame 
rate to 25fps max (maybe even max at a push, with a tailwind :). And a few 
people here have also said that Mildred doesn't work on their 030's, although 
some other people have said that it does.

> Would the use of Mildred allow me to retarget my game for a graphics card at a
> later stage?

It would allow you to retarget your game for a graphics card right at the start 
;) You'd also need to provide some way of selecting graphics cards screenmodes, 
although thats simply putting up an ASL requester and passing an extra option 
to the ScreenTags command.

> And the last question, and the most important at the moment is having had to

The easiest way is to have a window on your screen. You can then get intuition 
events using Event (so that it doesn't block your main loop). So your mouse co-
ordinates can be got by WMouseX and WMouseY. And before anyone bitches about 
windows being slow, you don't actually do the rendering to the window.

Not that I've tried this with Mildred, but from what I've read.

Hmm, dunno. Was that the blitz v3 wish list? I'm sure there was something

Hi Ralf

The biggest thing is probably the NCS and Mildred. NCS is a very modular, small 
and fast set of libraries for doing OS stuff like windows, screen, etc and are 
used instead of the regular Blitz things.

Mildred is a whole chunky graphics drawing system.

The BSS source was released free, you can get that from the Freeblitz page 
(check out the links in the page below, as I can't rememebr the URL).

There's probably other stuff too. Hmm, TCP lib I suppose (instead of having to 
use the evil bsdsocket.library), which you can get from the page below or 
http://www.simpleftp.co.uk.

Hello again!

Thankyou to all those who answered my needs for mouse coordinates in Amiga
mode. SMouseX and SMouseY did the trick handsomely.

Just another quick question. I was browsing the Help file that comes with
Blizt2 and noticed some 3D functions such as RenderToBitmap, Render3D and
RenderToChunky. Where is the documentation for these functions? Theres
nothing mentioned in the manual. Also Render3D doesn't appear as a valid
token if I put it in Blitz.

One last question. I am thinking of getting an '040,40 or maybe an '060,50.
Would such processors speed up the rendering of graphics to AGA screens or
will I still suffer a bottleneck and not see much speed improvement.

Thanks again.

That's probably part of the 3D stuff that was gonna go in (there are quite a
few 3D sounding commands in there). Not there though :(

If you use Mildred even on an 040/25 you'll see a definate speed increase over

Subject: @{b}Dodgy WPA8 Example@{ub}

Hi ,

Hmm, not so helpful I see.....thought there was more to it than that. I
remember Paul Burkey had a nice example of WPA8.

My code shows how you use paramaters.....but unforntuantly not how to setup
the data, which is quite simple, just an array of bytes. The number of the
byte represents the pen number in your 8bit palette.

000000
222222
000000

An array like the above would dump a line on the window using the pixel
colour 2.

The array would be dimmed, 

Dim Pixels.b(5,2)

For x=0 to 5
	Pixels(x,0)=0
Next x

For x=0 to 5
  Pixels(x,1)=2
Next x

For x=0 to 5
 Pixels(x,2)=0
Next x

Then

WritePixelArray8_ RastPort(win),0,0,5,2,Pixels(),0

I THINK. Long time since I used it.....

You sure you can specify 0 as the last parameter? The docs say you need to pass

Hello blitzers, 
  I've just thrown together a quick program to convert one ascii file format to 
another, and hit the usual snag - I'm using Edit$(90) to read in a line, before 
parsing it and writing it out again.  But when I get to the end of the file, 
the program just sits executing, but not getting any data.  I've got If Eof()'s 
sprinkled about, but it doesn't seem to help (presumably the file runs out 
halfway through the Edit$() ) - how can I make it detect the end of the file 
and exit cleanly?

Oh, and how do I make it recognise ctrl-C ? :)

Thanks,
Evan.

Be warned all who develops on UAE (as I figured this out the hard way) that Eof 
doesn't work. Instead of Eof(0), use Lof(0)=Loc(0), i.e.

While NOT(Eof(0))   ->    while NOT(Lof(0)=Loc(0))

If I understand it correctly, I'll need to insert this at strategic
points in a program so that the user hits Ctrl-C and the next time the
program executes that line it will take effect??

On most other machines I've used there is a feature to say to the OS
"when the event occurs, branch to the following address..."   which
means you only have to stick this in the front of the program and the
response is almost instantaneous.   Is there not this sort of feature
in the Amiga?

It's available as interrupts (which is maybe how the other systems you've seen 
have done it?), but I doubt you could do it as an interrupt on the Amiga. Well, 
I suppose you could do something with input.device, but the simplest solution 
is to check Ctrl-C manually when you need to.

There is this facility on the Amiga (and Blitz). If
you check the Blitz manual under Program Flow Commands
you will find a command called SetInt (pages 99-100)
which can be used to define a section of code as
'interupt code'.

Kind regards,

Francis.

Thanks Dave.  Actually I couldn't make it work because my Blitz doesn't know 
what SIGBREAKF is :(

I think it just replies on most programs having a main loop.  I've noticed 
quite a lot of utilities don't respond to a break if they're a bit busy.  In 
Blitz there's that interrupt handler gimmick.  But ctrl-C isn't an interrupt.  
What you could maybe do is make a vblank interrupt (even if you're not doing an 
arcade game) and put the ctrl-c detector in there, it'll work even if your 
program gets jammed in a loop.

Simple.  First make sure you have amigalibs.res resident in the compiler
options menu.  Then, if you're using YAM, turn off Textstyles
(Settings-->Textstyles or Amiga-T) and read this :

#SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C

It's a constant.  =]

That's a cunning idea.     The program I need to break has no main
loop (as such).   It consists of about 40 main loops which can each
take from a split-second to several minutes to complete one iteration.
The v-blank interrupt sounds good, provided the test doesn't take too
long.

The good news:

Yes, there is.  You can do this by setting up a "task exception", which will
interrupt your program when a Control C is detected by Exec (really, it
could signal you about anything you want...)

It is explained (sort of) in the RKMS under Exec/Tasks/Task Exceptions

The bad news:

You'd need to do it entirely by using OS functions, and it looks rather
complicated.

I can send you the information from the RKMS if you want it - there isn't an
example, though...

Make sure you leave the .info off the end of the file, if your icon is
called "test.info", you use "test" as the path in GetDiskObject_

ev.l=WaitEvent

	Select Chr$(EventCode)
	  Case "A"
		GtSetAttr gtlist,id,#GTMX_Active,1
	  Case "B"

	  ; etc

End Select

If you also want Amiga key to be pressed with the key, you'll have to check the 
Qualifier command - the key values it can return are in teh Blitz online help. 
Note, that I don't know if the Eventcode will still be just the key in this 
case or whether you will need to check for #IDCMP_RAWKEY messages. Also, it may 
not work as using RAmiga+<something> is normally used for menus (I suppose you 
could set up a menu to activate the gtmx, in which case the keyboard handling 
for those menu shortcuts would be done automatically) and LAmiga+<something> is 
normally used for system things.

That's what I wanted.  The GTString is active at this point, so
ordinary input should go to that.

That sounds logical.   I'll have to write a mini program to test it
out.

Also, I have a small demo of a Blitz executable I'd like tested on various

OK, crappy IDT WinChip C6 @ 200MHz, 160Mb RAM, ATI All-in-Wonder (128bit
32Mb Rage 128), "SoundBlaster compatible" sound card (don't ask ;)

Running Windoze 98 SE with DirectX 7 if that helps...

Not on Aminet I think. You can get them from the blitz-list server, by using
blitz-list-index@... etc, send a mail to blitz-list-help@netsoc.ucd.ie for all

Somebody was creating those archives "by hand"...I guess he's stopped doing

If someone wants to carry on creating these archives, presuming that
they aren't being made any more, I have a script that I wrote for use
with Yam that does it all for you in a few minutes. It can chop off the
list footers and handles attachments nicely as well. The amiga-c mailing
list archives are created using it.

Hi Matthew

No code, but have a look at the Autodocs for graphics.library/ObtainPen_.

Code would be something along the lines of:

WBToScreen 0
*scr.Screen = Peek.l(Addr Screen(0))
*cm.ColorMap = scr\ViewPort\ColorMap
pennum.l = 20    ; the pen number to lock, set to -1 if pen number
				 ; is not important

; the colour we want the pen set to. Values are 32bits per gun and are left
; justified, so $FFFFFFFF means full intensity, $80000000 means about half
; intensity, etc. In this case, it is a crappy purpley color.
penred.l = $FF000000
pengreen.l = $00000000
penblue.l = $FF000000

pennum=ObtainPen(*cm,pennum,penred,pengreen,penblue,#PEN_EXCLUSIVE)
if pennum<>-1
	; we have pen, do whatever you want with it
	ReleasePen(*cm, pennum)
end if

The above code will lock a pen, but it is an exclusive lock, meaning that no
other program can even use the same colours that you have locked.

This should be used with caution, especially if you are going to lock
several pens.  It is really only meant to be used if your program is going
to be changing the colour of that pen after locking it.

For standard remapping, ObtainBestPenA is a better choice.

Here are a couple of routines for using it.

Apart from the fact that you dimmed your array and called it commands but have 
used "arexx" everywhere else? You'd get compiler errors for that though.

Doh....I had actually used arexx everywhere in the source, but I started
to change it to "commands" for the e-mail (so it matched the MUI
example), but forgot to change the rest :)

Anyway...that doesn't work...when you ask the program for a list of the
available commands it just returns an ASCII 0x8 where it should have
"rescan" :/

Have you tried using &arexx(0) instead of arexx as the parameter in the muiset 
command?

whats the return value of the muiset command (if there is one) or the thing 
that show you if a mui command failed. there is error values defined in mui.h 
but maybe they don't apply here?

make sure you've dimmed the arexx array globally, and not in a function.

thats all i can think of just now :|

Yup...just causes enforcer hits to 0x8....that's what made me think there
was something wrong with the structure I was using.  Using a pointer
(*arexx) just causes a lockup, so it *definatly* ain't that :)

No errors...apparently.  It's like it accepts it, but it's trying to read
from the wrong memory address ($8, followed by $C, $D and then a long-write
to $4).

> make sure you've dimmed the arexx array globally, and not in a function.

Yup....it's right at the end of the code that generates the MUI interface.

> thats all i can think of just now :|

Oh well...thanks for the suggestions anyway :)

Subject: @{b}Re: MUI ARexx@{ub}


Figured out how this damn thing works....and I was right in that it was to
do with the "static" part of the structure.

It appears that MUI is expecting the .MUI_Command structure to be a single,
continuous block of memory (hence the last field being just NULL entries). 
Blitz appears to use a linked list no matter what, so I did this:

NEWTYPE .arexxcmd
  cmd.MUI_Command[1]
End NEWTYPE
Dim temp.arexxcmd(1)
temp(0)\cmd[0]\mc_Name=&msg_connect$,#MC_TEMPLATE_ID,#CONNECT,0
temp(0)\cmd[1]\mc_Name=0,0,0,0
MUISet #APP,#MUIA_Application_Commands,&temp(0)\cmd

And this works, when called the ARexx script returns instantly and a
#CONNECT event is inserted into the input stream (MUIEvent or
MUIWaitEvent).  Unfortunatly you cannot have user interaction this way (eg.
"connect ftp://localhost/"). To do user interaction you have to use
something like:

url$="URL/A"
temp(0)\cmd[0]\mc_Name=&msg_connect$,&url$,1,&connecthook

...and create a hook for the &connecthook address.  Unfortunatly, I just
realised that there is another command, which takes a single hook for it's
parameter, and that hook is used whenever MUI cannot map a command to one
it knows.  So all your arexx stuff can be done by creating a hook to handle
all the arexx stuff, and then use a command like:

MUISet #APP,#MUIA_Application_ARexxHook,&arexxhook

So know I'm just busy trying to write the hook for this thing :)

Don't worry, most questions on the list are about Blitz Amiga, it's just
that everyone is overjoyed at having a good programming language for

Obviously we will try to answer all your questions as best as we can, and
there are a lot of well-experienced people on the list (eg. dave mcminn :)

Noooo! This is an amiga list. The thing is that the author of Blitz is
making a PC version of blitz and that has been the predominant topic
over the past couple of days. The best thing to do to get us off that
line of thought would be to ask some blitz based questions ;)

Hello
I have had my Amiga for the last 7 years and only now can I find more
time to do what I want with my set up. this list I used to view on af
cd roms but last week I took the plunge and signed up .
to my horror it appears to have been assimalated to the pc blitz
list.
I am only a beginner but have a lot of radical ideas for new games to
bring to the Amiga. But as the Blitz mamual is reference my self and
3 others code through trial and error.

You guys we hold as hard core Amiga elete and without your wisdom we
are poised to fail.   Of corse being amigans we wont give up , we
wont sell our Amigas for peanuts and buy a pc for 800 quid, no well
spend the 800 quid on our Amiga.

I guess , what Im saying is that if you guys have all gone to the pc
then , I wont stay on the list ( obiviously off topics happen and are
ok by me  )  ill try to find another Amiga list.

hope you dont mind me butting in and look forward to feed back .

Really?  I have an A590 and it works with HDToolbox, although it did come
with its own disk (that containted HDToolbox)...  The 590 though is
apparently a 2091, not a 2090 so they may be different...  What happens
when you try HDToolbox?

The A2090 and A2091 are very different in that only the latter is a fully
fledged SCSI card, the A2090 takes MFM-XT hard disks.  The 2091 and 590 have
a proper SCSI controller.

that`s exactly the problem. I want to install a mfm-xt drive and hdtoolbox

When you say 'devs' do you mean devices?  Like a .device file?  I'm not sure
what the A2090's device is called, possibly xt.device (doubt it is called
mfm.device because that's a multi format device handler used by CrossDOS),
i'm not sure.  Finding that install disk could be hard, and is likely to be
sourced from a early A2000HD machine.  What machine is this being fixed to?  

Also, in HDToolBox there is the 'Change Drive Type', you can enter the
details about a drive, and in those options is a cycler with the label
'Drive Types:' you can toggled that between SCSI and XT.  For more info
you'd need the Amiga Hard Disk User Manual, which I don't find atm.

Regards

Nick.

Subject: @{b}Palette fades...@{ub}

Hello,

I've tried to write my own palette fading routine for two screens, but it
never seems to work. I got it working once, but now I've changed the screen
layouts and it has stopped working for some reason. So, I'm asking you lot
for help :)

How would I go about fading in and out on a SCREEN? (the FadeIn/Out commands
only work on slices IIRC)?
Also, is it possible to crossfade palettes? And to fade from one palette to
another? All on AmigaOS screens (created using the standard Screen command)

Thanks.

Catch ya later,
GazChap.

Erm I think in Blitz 2.1 there is a command called FadePalette, I might be wrong
because my Blitz has all other sorts of nasty things glued on like BSS and a ton
of stuff from Aminet (NCS/Mildred for one.)

Anyway I think the key to this is just changing the palette, and also you might
want to use the SetRGB32 (or is it LoadRGB32 ?) workarround, it seems to work
better. (On AGA machines and graphics cards anyway.)

The FadePalette command has something to do with brightness, which I'm not
sure is what I wantd.

Hi Gareth

> Set/LoadRGB32? WTF is that? :)

Tsk. OS function of course ;)

Basically you can use it like this:

LoadRGB32_ ViewPort(screen num),Peek.l(Addr Palette(palett num))

I think. It sticks the palette onto your screen and I daresay this is what was 
in Curt's code. Anyway, this will pretty much let you do anything since you 
manually change the palette, so you can create any effect you want.

The best thing would be to find out if there are any computer fairs in your area
and try find a good deal. I got a P75 with network card and 1.2BG HD for £20.
Though I'll only be using it for playing with networking under Linux.
Computer fairs are definitely the best place to look first.

My colleague has just ordered a second-hand P90 from a company called
Sterling Management which regularly advertise in MicroMart etc. The total
cost was about £70 including postage and VAT. This didn't include a monitor,
though.

> P.P.S. Are the PC amiga emulators any good for blitz
> programming?

My Sony Vaio PCG400 laptop runs UAE brilliantly (once I'd got the graphics
sorted, and stopped using AGA emulation). I can even use IBrowse, etc. to
surf the net. However, I'd recommend at least 300MHz for any emulation
purposes (an 450MHz AMD processor is only £32+VAT, which you could probably
run at up to 233MHz on older socket-7 motherboards). I use two different
configurations depending on if I'm doing BlitzMode development or WB
development (1600x1200 WB on my desktop machine, 800x600 on the laptop).

And, don't forget that Mark Sibly is working on a PC version of BB.

I still own an Amiga (1200, Blizzard 68030/50, desktop-case, CD, 16Mb, ...),
but I've lent it to somebody (along with a spare PC, and my PSX).

I'd recover it and use it, if only I could use it on my PC's monitor,
without paying a fortune for  a decent graphics card. In the meantime, I'll
continue using UAE to do any Amiga related stuff (and I suspect that there
are a few blitzlist subscribers that do the same - this is a blitz list, and
not a anti-PC list, afterall).

We know that anyway :)

I used to use IBrowse on an 030/50. I also used only 16 colours, which means
MagicTV can reduce flicker in Hi-Res Interlaced...but it's an "acquired
taste" ;) Quite alright for gentle browsing, but I'm on a PC now, and I have
to say that I like IE5...uh-oh!

I'd say sell the 486 for £60 and buy a low-end 2nd hand PC. My sister just
got one for £240, with 32Mb, 233 Pentium, Win98. Quite reasonable for web
browsing...

I think to get a decent experience on the Amiga you'd need a gfx card and
one of the latest browsers, but I couldn't say...

I'll be testing that theory soon (my programs written on the Amiga work

debugger on). And you can't use things like Enforcer or Mungwall. But who needs 
them with Blitz :)

That's what I was using until about a month ago.

For a normal 'free' ISP try Abel Gratis.Their service was fine when I was with

I prefer Ibrowse,but you need to use all of them from time to time.
Aweb's javascript is much better at the moment.

Possibly cheaper (external modems are a bit more expensive),
but a 486 is very crap.My 040/25 is faster than my dad's Pentium 133 for web browsing (but then,the pentium is pretty screwed up).

What you want is a 56k external modem,and a SilverSurfer.
Then try out the software and see which ones you like best.
(personally I use Miami,Yam and IBrowse)

Then save up for a gfx card. :)

On my setup (020/28mhz/4fast) AWeb-II 3 was the buggiest, most crash prone
browser I got my hands on...  Well, that was until Voyager 3 came out, which
REFUSES to boot.  So I use IBrowse 2.  It's got the least amount of
features, but it's actuallyturned around to be the most stable (it used to
be the worst!) =]

SS> P.P.S. Are the PC amiga emulators any good for blitz

If you have a PC of at LEAST 400mhz (preferably more than 500:) and you
stick to OS programming, it's probably a pretty good solution.

I used to think WinUAE was as buggy as most other programs run by Windoze,
but the latest version is very complete and stable.

I'm using an ECS A2000 with an 030/25.    Web sites look lousy, speed
is tolerable (my tolerance level is high!).

I'm using Voyager 3 from the Netconnect 3 package.    Well worth the
money to buy the whole NC3 thing.   (Be warned though, the
distribution CD is stuffed Voyager and WebVision both need newer
versions to work properly)

An AGA 040/40 should be pretty good (not excellent though).

I have an 030/50 AGA with the "poor man's gfx card" -
that is, a flicker fixer and multi-synch PC monitor, plus FBlit.
Also 16M fast ram.

The only PC I have any experience with is my boss's 233 pentium.

As far as browsing goes, I find both my setup and his are similar in
speed and visual quality.

I used to use an old A2500 for browsing, but things looked pretty dreadful
in 16 colours...

I mostly use Aweb, although I have all 3 browsers.  It is the fastest and
most stable on my system.

But there are demo versions of all 3 - try 'em out, and see which works best
for you.

Later...

I wish to :) I have A1200 40/040 but the speed of my web browser (V 2.95) is
reasonable with 32/64 colours screen mode (I'm also using mutisync
monitor). Above that all slows down very much. Personaly to WWW sites I'm
using pC with IE 5 (it can save sites with all graphics) but olny that to
e-mails and ftp sites I prefer Amiga's software (YAM and AmFTP).

  My A-4000 040/25 AGA with IBrowse 1.2 works very nicely, but I have a
multi-sync monitor and use Double NTSC HiRes NoFlicker mode.  Everything
looks nearly as good as on a PC but is somewhat larger and easier to read.
Color graphics look great, but very large ones must be scrolled as must
very large pages.  Over all I find it very satisfactory.  The limiting
factor is the speed of the servers I am contacting, not my equiptment.
Of course I am using the regular (56kbaud) connection.  With one of the
superfast (300-600kb) connections it would be a different story, but I
can't afford such a connection anyway.

Even if you could afford it, you have to check some really techy stuff with
your ISP when it comes to cable modems and the Amiga (Holger Kruse posted a
huge description of the problem(s) on the TA list last year -- his article
might be on nordicglobal.com still)...

I've been saying this for years, witness their supposed "efforts" in
Northern Ireland.  More often than naught, I get a horrible crackling phone
line which causes havoc with the modem, BT is at a loss to explain it. 
THose of you saying "move to another telephone company", I can't.  BT has a
monopoly in NI, similar to that of Microsoft's in the PC world.  I've been
told I won't be able to get ADSL when it becomes available, because it
would cost too much to redo the cables in my area, and I can't get
BTSurfTime as it has yet to be enabled on the local exchange.

BT are just plain crap, sod the adverts of people saying they "went back to
BT for the customer service", it's blatent lies...

It's not that bad.  I have a similar setup only with a 14" SVGA monitor
plugged in.  Colours aren't the greatest...but is far nicer to use than a
PC :)

I prefer Voyager for web browsing, it's the most stable for me.  But others
seem to prefer IBrowse, and the anti-MUI people only have the choice of
AWeb...I use Wirenet for access (http://www.wirenet.u-net.com/) run by Neil
Bothewick of CU Amiga/Amigactive.

Doubtful...to get anything like Java/Javascript/Flash, you're gonna need a
bit more than a 486 :/

From: Nick Lamburn <oruk_amigan@btinternet.com>
Date: 06-09-00 18:53:04
Subject: @{b}Waiting on multiple ports@{ub}

Hello

Right I have a little problem.  It's quite a simple one, but I'm not sure
how to go about solving it....  

Say I have three windows open, all belonging to my program, and that I wish
to wait for events from them, or an IntuiMessage.  How can I make the
computer wait for activity on these Window's userports without having to
'poll' the user port, and wait for activity instead.

Now I could 'OR' the userports all together, but the problem is that any
number of windows can be open (1-5) at the time, and I'm not sure it would
work.  It could be possible to OR all five, even when there is no window
open there, but how do I know which Window was actually affected?

I am currently using WaitPort() to wait for events.  My Windows are opened
via Intuition's OpenWindowTags() command.

Any ideas?

All the best,

Nick.

What do you mean could, thats what you /have/ to do! Just check the window
pointers, OR'ing in 0 doesn't do anything, i.e.

For i.w=1 to 5
	If *win(i) Then waitmask.l = waitmask | *win(i)\UserPort\mp_SigBit
Next

There is a field in the IntuiMessage called IDCMPWindow which is a pointer to
the window which had the event.

If you are going to have lots of multiple windows, it is far better to use a
shared IDCMP message port. There's info in the RKRMs (or maybe it's the
Autodocs) on how to do this. But its fairly simple:

1) Create a message port
2) When opening windows, pass 0 for the IDCMP flags and then use ModifyIDCMP to set
up the IDCMP flags. Put the pointer to your mesasge port into the Window
UserPort.
3) When processing events, IDCMPWindow is still used, but now you only have to
wait for 1 window, giving you the full 15 other user signals
4) when closing the window, use ModifyIDCMP to set  the IDCMP for the wqindow to
0, set the UserPort to 0 and then go through the messages waiting at the message
port, Remove_'ing then Reply_'ing all those messages which should have gone to
the window you are closing. The C code for this is in the
intuition.library/CloseWindow autodoc.
