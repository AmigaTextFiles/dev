Introduction
------------

Last week, I was working on my C project and I needed to
know how pre-processor commands were interpreted. But
the output generated by the -E option of my compiler
contained lots of empty lines and it wasn't easy to
read (and to print). So I decided to create C Filter.


Installation
------------

Just put CFilter in any drawer. Don't forget you'll need the Ixemul
library or it won't work (compiled with GCC). It is available on
Aminet or in the GCC package.


Usage
-----

        CFilter <filename>

where filename stands for the name of the file containing your pre-processed
source.


Disclaimer
----------

You use C Filter at your own risks. It has been tested for hours on my computer
(A1200). I can't be responsible if it breaks something (it shouldn't, due
to the algorithms used).


History
-------

March 1995          Version 1.0         Initial release
