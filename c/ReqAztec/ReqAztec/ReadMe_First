About ReqAztec5

    ReqPro  is  a  package  supplied  with CygnusEd from CygnusSoft and is
    public  domain.  It provides glues for the use of the req.library with
    aztec  C  3.6  and Lattice C.  As objet file format changed from aztec
    3.6  to  5.0,  I  couldn't  use  the  reqglue.o given.  So, It was the
    occasion  for  me  to  make  pragmas  and  enhance  the  glues to this
    fantastic library.

    I  made  little  modifications to the reqbase.h file for compatibility
    with arpbase.h.  See the modified req.doc file for documentation.

    SimpleRequest()  and  TwoGadRequest() take now one more parameter, the
    title of the window.

    A library req.lib is given for use with the aztec linker version 5 for
    req functions that do not support pragmas.

    This code is public domain.
