  And it would be nice, if you keep a note in the docs, that you've
  used it.

@node intro

  While I was trying to do some hardware hacks using C, I need a routine
that prints out the copperlist I'm created, to check for errors.  So, I
wrote this little routine.  And now, I offer it to you!  ;) @endnode @node
using

  Just include the "copdis.h" header into your source. I also recomment, to
avoid the build-in Ctrl-C handling by putting the line

@{b}void _ chkabort(void) { return; }@{ub}

at the top of your source.

Then, all you have to do is calling the function cop_dis(). The only
parameter is the start of the copper list which will be put out to the
console, then.

The output means:

$xxxx (move|wait|skip) $yyyy,$zzzz ; name

$xxxx            : Offset of copper command in copper list.
(move|wait|skip) : Kind of copper command (only for reference)
$yyyy,$zzzz      : Copper command itself (no bits are masked out, no matter
                   what kind of command)
name             : the name of the H/W register, if known
@endnode
@node demo

  Take a lock at the demo source ("CopDis.c").  It will print out the
current copperlist (or copperlists if you use an interlaced screen).

  Maybe, there will be some time, a new amiga may be released. If this will
happen, some more h/w registers will be awayable. If you want these regs to
be named by CopDis, the only thing you have to do is adding the names and
offsets to the "copper_reg" array in "copdis.h".
@endnode
@node requirements

  I wrote this routine using GNU-C 2.7.2.1, but you can use it with your
own C compiler with maybe some little conversions.
