This was converted from a nasty little unix man page, so here goes.


ascii -- report character aliases

SYNOPSIS
ascii [-dxohv] [-t] [char-alias...]

OPTIONS
Called with no options, ascii behaves like `ascii -h'.  Options
are as follows:

-t
Script-friendly mode, emits only ISO/decimal/hex/octal/binary
encodings of the character.

-s
Parse multiple characters.  Convenient way of parsing strings.

-d
Ascii table in decimal.

-x
Ascii table in hex.

-o
Ascii table in octal.

-h, -?
Show summary of options and a simple ASCII table.

-v
Show version of program.

DESCRIPTION
Characters in the ASCII set can have many aliases, depending on context. A
character's possible names include:

Its bit pattern (binary representation).

Its hex, decimal and octal representations.

Its teletype mnemonic and caret-notation form (for control chars).

Its backlash-escape form in C (for some control chars).

Its printed form (for printables).

Its full ISO official name in English.

Its ISO/ECMA code table reference.

Slang and other names in wide use for it among hackers.

This utility accepts command-line strings and tries to interpret them as
one of the above. When it finds a value, it prints \fIall\fR of the names
of the character.The constructs in the following list can be used to 
specify character values. If an argument could be interpreted in two or
more ways, names for all the different characters it might be are dumped.


Any character not described by one of the following conventions
represents the character itself.

 ^ character
A caret followed by a character.

 \e \|character
A backslash followed by certain special characters (abfnrtv).

mnemonic
An ASCII teletype mnemonic.

hexadecimal
A hexadecimal (hex) sequence consists of one or two case-insensitive hex digit
characters (01234567890abcdef). To ensure hex interpretation use
 hex h,
 0x hex,
 x hex
or
 \e\|x hex.

decimal
A decimal sequence consists of one, two or three decimal digit
characters (0123456789). To ensure decimal interpretation use
 \e0d decimal,
 d decimal,
or
 \e\|d decimal.

octal
An octal sequence consists of one, two or three octal digit
characters (01234567). To ensure octal interpretation use
 \e \|octal,
 0o octal,
 o octal,
or
 \e\|o octal.

bit pattern
A bit pattern (binary) sequence consists of one to eight binary digit
characters (01). To ensure bit interpretation use
 0b bit\ pattern,
 b bit\ pattern
or
 \e\|b bit\ pattern.

SO / ECMA\ code
A ISO/ECMA code sequence consists of one or two decimal digit characters,
a slash, and one or two decimal digit characters.

name
An official ASCII or slang name.

The slang names recognized and printed out are from a rather comprehensive
list that appeared on USENET in early 1990.

Mnemonics recognized and printed include the official ASCII set, some
official ISO names (where those differ) and a few common-use alternatives
(such as NL for LF). All comparisons are case-insensitive, and dashes are
mapped to spaces.

Any unrecognized arguments or out of range values are silently ignored.
Note that the -s option will not recognize 'long' names, as it cannot
differentiate them from other parts of the string.

For correct results, be careful to stringize or quote shell metacharacters
in arguments (especially backslash).

This utility is particularly handy for interpreting cc(1)'s ugly octal
`invalid-character' messages, or when coding anything to do with serial
communications. As a side effect it serves as a handy base-converter
for random 8-bit values.
