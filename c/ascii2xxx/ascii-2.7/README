ascii

This is a handy little utility that recognizes many different ways of
naming an ASCII character (hex, octal, binary, decimal, C escape, ISO
character table pair, slang names, and others) and prints out all the
equivalents.

The latest sources for this utility live at

AmigaOS Notes.
egcs wont compile it under libnix, so you will need ixemul v48+ to use it.
You can get this from aminet, you also get a sensible text file rarther
than a man page, buts its still unix syntax, but its about time you learned
it anyway.
