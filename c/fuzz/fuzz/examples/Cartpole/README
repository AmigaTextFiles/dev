This directory includes an examples for the use of the fuzzy library and fcc.

The equations describing the cartpole dynamics originate from
A. Barto, R. Sutton, C. Anderson.
Neuronlike elements that can solve difficult learning control problems.
IEEE SMC, 1983.
   
The fuzzy controller was generated according to:
H.R. Berenji & P. Khedkar. 
Learning and tuning fuzzy controllers through reinforcements.
IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, Vol. 3, No. 5, 1992.

    

cartpole.fuzzy: Fuzzy controller for cartpole balancing problem

cartpole.c         : Main program simulating cartpole
cartcontroller.c   : Sourcecode of FC generated by fcc, options -ansi
cartpole           : Executable linked from cartpole.o and cartcontroller.o


cartctrlcomplete.c : Sourcecode of FC generated by fcc, options -ansi -main
                     standalone version
cartctrlcomplete   : Executable, variables are transferred via command line


cartpolegui.c      : Simple graphical cartpole simulation. Cannot be compiled,
                     since it uses a tools library that should currently not
                     be distributed separately.
