 AS:001

 No input file specified
 -----------------------
 You ran DAS without specifying the assembly file to assemble!

 AS:002

 Unable to open %s
 -----------------
 DAS was unable to open the assembly file you specified

 AS:003

 Empty File or Unable to Seek
 ----------------------------
 DAS cannot assemble empty files.  This error can also occur if you
 specify a device or pipe instead of a file (DAS must be able to seek
 within the file).

 AS:004

 Ran out of memory, you may have to break up your source files
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 DAS is a known memory hog, if you get this error message the most
 effective work around is to breakup the source file in question into
 two or more pieces.

 AS:005

 Error reading input
 -------------------
 DAS has problems reading the assembly file you specified

 AS:006

 Unable to create %s
 -------------------
 DAS was unable to create the object file you specified.  This could
 be due to specifying a path for which some sub directories do not
 exist, for example.

 AS:009

 Syntax error
 ------------
 A syntax error occured attempting to parse the specified line of
 assembly

 AS:010

 Illegal Label: %s
 -----------------
 The specified label is illegal. DAS only accepts alpha-numerics, '_',
 and @.

 AS:011

 Expected an operator, got: %c
 -----------------------------
 This generally indicates a syntax error in an expression.

 AS:012

 Expected an expression
 ----------------------
 This generally indicates a syntax error in an expression.

 AS:013

 Bad register specification
 --------------------------
 An illegal register specification was given, such as:
     movem.l D0-D2/A5:,-(sp)

 AS:014

 Expected no operands for %s
 ---------------------------
 The pseudoop on the specified line does not take any operands

 AS:015

 Bad internal id
 ---------------
 This indicates a software error within DAS.
 <i> Ough Shit,.. Better mail Richard</i>

 AS:016

 extension of .%c is illegal
 ---------------------------
 The most common occurance of this error message is when the main
 compiler tries to cast an integer into a void or vise versa and
 doesn't catch the problem, passing an instruction to DAS with a .0
 extension.

 AS:017

 bad operand size: %d
 --------------------
 This normally indicates a software error within DAS.

 AS:018

 Removed branch to next location
 -------------------------------
 This occurs if the verbose option is given.  DAS is indicating that
 it has removed a branch instruction.

 AS:019

 Branch Optimization Module
 --------------------------
 A software error occured in the branch optimization module.

 AS:020

 Bad l_Mask/l_RegNo %d 0x%04x
 ----------------------------
 Generally indicates a software error in the MOVEM/MOVE optimization
 module.

 AS:021

 Optimized Bxx - BRA
 -------------------
 This occurs if the verbose option is given and indicates that DAS has
 been able to optimize a 'branch to a branch' into a single branch.

 AS:022

 Illegal relocation
 ------------------
 This occurs if the assembly attempts to do a relocation for which
 there is no analog in the amiga object module format.

 AS:023

 Negative Section length: %d
 ---------------------------
 This occurs if, somehow, you've managed to confuse DAS into thinking
 the length of a section is less then 0!

 AS:024

 Bad section directive, format is [MAJOR HEADING],type
 -----------------------------------------------------
 Generally indicates a syntax error parsing the section directive.

 AS:025

 Illegal section type, must be one of: code,data,bss,abs
 -------------------------------------------------------
 You have specified an illegal section directive.  The section type
 may be one of DATA, BSS, CODE, or ABS.  ABS sections are used to
 export absolute labels such as _LVO* style labels.

 AS:026

 Conflict in section MAJOR HEADING, previous section exists with different type
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When specifying section MAJOR HEADINGs you may not specify the same
 MAJOR HEADING for two different section types.  You can specify the
 same section MAJOR HEADING for the same section type as many times as
 you wish, and DICE relies on this feature heavily to switch between
 the code, data and other sections.

 AS:027

 Only positive label offsets for relocation purposes
 ---------------------------------------------------
 DAS can only deal with positive label offsets.  That is, it cannot
 deal with subtraction of address labels.

 AS:028

 Must specify .W or .L for relocatable outer displacement
 --------------------------------------------------------
 This generally indicates a syntax error in a 68020 instruction.  The
 outer displacement must be explicitly specified as word or long.

 AS:029

 Cannot have outer displacement if no brackets [] in pseudoop
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 This generally indicates a syntax error in a 68020 instruction.

 AS:030

 This is a 68020 opcode, use 'mc68020' directive
 -----------------------------------------------
 You have specified a 68020 (or greater) opcode without specifying the
 'mc68020' directive.

 AS:031

 Undefined Label: %s
 -------------------
 The specified label is referenced in the assembly but not defined
 anywhere.

 AS:032

 Expected terminating %c in string
 ---------------------------------
 A string beginning with a double quote must be terminated by a double
 quote. A string beginning with a single quote must be terminated by a
 single quote.

 AS:033

 Extranious garbage ignored: %s
 ------------------------------
 DAS has completed processing a line of assembly but there is extra,
 unexpected junk on the line.

 AS:034

 Illegal Addressing mode(s) %d %d opcode %s
 ------------------------------------------
 The specified opcode does not have the capability to use the
 specified addressing modes (refer to the specific line of assembly,
 the addressing mode codes are cryptic).

 AS:035

 Directive requires a label
 --------------------------
 The directive on the specified line requires a label beginning in the
 left hand column.  E.G. an EQU without no label.

 AS:036

 Directive requires a size extension
 -----------------------------------
 The directive, probably a DS or DC directive, requires a .B, .W, or
 .L extension.

 AS:037

 Expected comma, got %c (ascii %d)
 ---------------------------------
 This generally indicates a syntax error in an expression

 AS:038

 Data generation from directive different size between passes %d - %d
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 This generally indicates something wierd with the arguments to a DC
 or DS directive... the number of bytes the directive specifies has
 changed between passes!

 AS:039

 internal error handling debug directive
 ---------------------------------------
 This generally indicates a software error in the handling of the
 debug directive, which is used by the compiler to include -d1 line
 debug information.

 AS:040

 Label multiply defined: %s
 --------------------------
 The given label is defined in more then one place in the assembly.

 AS:041

 Unknown Directive: %s
 ---------------------
 The specified directive is not implemented in DAS.

 AS:042

 Label address mismatch between passes %s %d - %d
 ------------------------------------------------
 A phase error between passes has occured.  This can occur due to an
 instruction changing size unexpectedly between passes or due to a bug
 in DAS's internal optimizations.

 AS:043

 Address mismatch between passes %d - %d
 ---------------------------------------
 See AS:042

 AS:044

 Word offset out of range: %d
 ----------------------------
 Indicates a word offset is beyond the -32768 to 32767 range of values
 it is allowed to take on.
   
 AS:045
   
 Byte offset out of range: %d
 ----------------------------
 Indicates a byte offset is beyond the -128 to 127 range of values it
 is allowed to take on.
   
 AS:046
   
 offset out of range: %d (0-7 only)
 ----------------------------------
 Indicates a bit field offset is beyond the 0-7 allowed for it.
   
 AS:047
   
 offset out of range: %d (1-8 only)
 ----------------------------------
 Indicates a bit field offset is beyond the 1-8 allowed for it (ADDQ,
 etc..)
   
 AS:048
   
 offset out of range: %d (0-15 only)
 -----------------------------------
 Indicates a bit field offset is beyond the 0-15 allowed for it (TRAP,
 etc..)
   
 AS:049
   
 short branch to next instruction illegal
 ----------------------------------------
 It is illegal to have a short (byte offset) branch to the next
 instruction because this instruction format is reserved for word
 offset branches.
   
 AS:050
   
 byte branch is out of range
 ---------------------------
 The destination of the branch cannot be reached with a byte offset.
 This normally occurs if you force the branch to use a byte offset.
 Note that if you specify a branch with NO extension, DAS will
 automatically optimize the branch to use a byte offset if possible.
   
 AS:051

 internal instruction id error: %d
 ---------------------------------
 Generally indicates a software error within DAS.
