    LK:001

    Can't create JMP for PC-rel offset greater then +/-32K, hunk too large
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    DLink cannot handle PC-relative jumps that are greater then +/-32K if
    jumping within the same module.  DLink has no problem with
    PC-relative jumps to outside the module (it create a jump table at
    the end of the module for that).  This error indicates you must
    either use the large-code model or split up the source file in
    question.

    LK:002

    Relocation error, range (%d) falls outside hunk (%s)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    DLink has detected a relocation entry in an object or library module
    that specifies a relocation outside the program being linked.

    LK:003

    Ran out of memory during linking
    --------------------------------
    DLink has run out of memory.  DLink can take a large amount of memory
    to run, especially when compiling with the 2.0 amiga libraries.  On a
    small machine you may have to compile with -1.3 instead of -2.0.

    LK:004

    Relocation error, relocation to non-existant hunk %d of %d
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    DLink has detected a relocation entry in an object module that points
    to a non-existant hunk.

    LK:005

    No relocation info allowed for BSS data!
    ----------------------------------------
    It is illegal to have relocations for BSS data.  You can relocate an
    address in BSS to some other hunk but cannot relocate information IN
    a BSS hunk.  The BSS hunk must remain zero'd out.

    LK:006

    PC relative access to illegal symbol (type %d)
    ----------------------------------------------
    DLink has detected a PC relative access to a symbol which is not
    PC-relative accessible... that is, not in a code hunk or not in the
    same code hunk if -frag is enabled.

    LK:007

    Internal Error in jump table creation
    -------------------------------------
    This indicates a software error in DLink relating to the creation of
    jump tables.  This should never occur, but if it does you should be
    able to work around it by using the large code model.

    LK:008

    External symbol relocation error, relocation to non-existant hunk
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    DLink has detected a symbol relocation to a hunk that does not exist.

    LK:009

    Relocation error, offset not word aligned
    -----------------------------------------
    DLink has detected a word or long relocation to a byte-aligned
    address. word and long relocations may only be made to word-aligned
    addresses.

    LK:010

    Relocation to illegal symbol (type %d)
    --------------------------------------
    DLink has detected a relocation to an illegal symbol.  For example,
    an A4-relative relocation to a symbol in the code hunk instead of the
    data hunk.

    LK:011

    Error parsing object module %s offset %d
    ----------------------------------------
    DLink has detected what is most likely a corrupt object module.

    LK:012

    Unknown symbol type %d in file %s
    ---------------------------------
    DLink has come across a symbol type which it does not understand.

    LK:013

    Unknown hunk type 0x%08lx in %s
    -------------------------------
    DLink has come across a hunk type that it does not understand,
    possibly indicating a corrupted object module.

    LK:014

    Software Error 146
    ------------------
    This indicates a software error within DLink, we would appreciate it
    if you reported the error.

    LK:015

    object format error, more hunks then expected
    ---------------------------------------------
    DLink has come across more hunks in an object module then the object
    module's header has specified.

    LK:016

    object format error, fewer hunks then expected
    ----------------------------------------------
    DLink has come across fewer hunks in an object module then the object
    module's header has specified.

    LK:017,LK:018,LK:019

    Error 556, Error 562, Error 571
    -------------------------------
    These indicate a software error within DLink, we would appreciate it
    if you reported the error.

    LK:020

    Cannot deal with empty data hunks!
    ----------------------------------
    DLink cannot deal with 0 length data hunks.

    LK:021

    final size mismatch %d/%d
    -------------------------
    DLink carefully calculates the size of a module incrementally and
    through an algorithm.  If these sizes mismatch it generally indicates
    a bug somewhere within dlink.  We would appreciate it if these and
    other software errors were reported.

    LK:022

    internal reloc array mismatch %d/%d
    -----------------------------------
    This is another software error relating to the internal self checks
    DLink makes.

    LK:023,LK:024

    Assertion failed line %d %s, Error freeing memory
    -------------------------------------------------
    DLink is really confused if you ever get these.  We would appreciate
    it if you report this error when you get it.

    LK:025

    PC relative relocation to data symbol! %s:%s sym=%.*s
    -----------------------------------------------------
    You cannot make a PC-relative relocation to a data symbol.  This
    message could indicate incorrect usage of the const storage
    qualifier.

    LK:026

    32 bit relocations illegal for -pi/-pr: %s:%s
    ---------------------------------------------
    DLink will check the relocations it generates against the compilation
    options you gave it.  In this case, DLink has found that it must do
    32 bit relocations which is in direct conflict with the purpose of
    the -pi or -pr options to DCC.

    LK:027

    32 bit DATA/BSS relocations illegal for -r: %s:%s
    -------------------------------------------------
    DLink will check the relocations it generates against the compilation
    options you gave it.  In this case, DLink has found that it must do
    32 bit data/bss relocations which are in direct conflict with the
    purpose of the -r options to DCC.... pure code would not be
    generated.  Note that DICE still allows you to statically initialize
    pointers to addresses of variables or routines through the generation
    of autoinit code.

    LK:028

    Relocation scan, hunk out of range: %d/%d
    -----------------------------------------
    This message is similar to LK:002

    LK:029

    PC relative relocations for BSS data is illegal
    -----------------------------------------------
    This message is similar to LK:025 but indicates a PC relative
    relocation into BSS instead of initialized DATA.

    LK:030

    Illegal PC relative relocation: %s:%s to %s:%s
    ----------------------------------------------
    This message is a catch-all for other illegal PC-relative relocations
    such as between code hunks of different MAJOR HEADINGs when -frag is
    eanbled.

    LK:031

    label(An) relocation to code section is illegal
    -----------------------------------------------
    DLink has come across a small-data model relocation into a code hunk
    instead of into a data or bss hunk.

    LK:032

    8 bit relocation out of range (%d) in %s
    ----------------------------------------
    DLink is unable to perform an 8 bit relocation due to it being out of
    the valid -128 to +127 range.

    LK:033

    16 bit inter-hunk relocation out of range (%d) in %s
    ----------------------------------------------------
    DLink is unable to perform a 16 bit relocation due to it being out of
    the valid -32768 to +32767 range.

    LK:034

    Multiply defined symbol: %.*s (%s &amp; %s)
    ---------------------------------------
    DLink has come across two definitions for the same symbol between
    object modules.  This can also occur when porting UNIX code which
    expects a common variable linking model.  DICE has the capability to
    generate common variables, please refer to the -mu option to DCC for
    more information.

    LK:035

    Multiply defined symbol in same library! %.*s
    ---------------------------------------------
    DLink has come across two definitions for the same symbol IN THE SAME
    LIBRARY MODULE.

    LK:036

    Undefined Symbol: %.*s (%s)
    ---------------------------
    DLink has come across references to a symbol but is unable to find a
    definition for the symbol.

    LK:037

    Illegal A4-rel to far object: %.*s %s from %s
    ---------------------------------------------
    DLink has come across an attempt to make a small-data model reference
    to an object only accessible through the absolute long addressing
    mode.  This can occur if you declare a variable as __far in one
    module but not in another. Such extern's are better placed in a
    header file so this type of confusion cannot occur.

    It is illegal to make small-data accesses to objects declared as
    __far or compiled with -mD. This can occur, for example, if you
    compile a module -mD and declare a library base variable, say,
    IntuitionBase, which is then referenced by the OpenScreen() tag as
    small-data due to the use of the small-data amiga.lib

    The solution is to either not compile the module __far or to leave
    the -mD option in and declare IntuitionBase as __near, as in:

    __near long IntuitionBase;

    These types of problems normally occur only when you attempt to mix
    models.. that is, compile some modules with the small data model and
    others with the large data model.

    LK:038

    Absolute refs to BSS/DATA illegal with -r/-p* sym=%.*s
    ------------------------------------------------------
    32 bit references to a BSS/DATA symbol are illegal when you generate
    residentable or position independant code.  DICE will automatically
    work around these restrictions so the error is most likely due to
    either mixed up memory models (compiling some files with -r and
    others wiethout -r) or custom assembly of your own that makes an
    illegal reference for the memory model chosen.

    LK:039

    Hunk has no CODE, DATA or BSS! %s in %s
    ---------------------------------------
    DLink has come across a hunk with no CODE, DATA, or BSS subsections.

    LK:040

    32 bit data-data relocations are illegal when using -r
    ------------------------------------------------------
    This error message is similar to LK:038 and LK:037 and indicates a
    problem relating to the following type of declaration:

    long a, *b = &amp;a;

    Note that DICE should work around the restriction AUTOMATICALLY when
    you use the -r option, so unless you have mixed memory models up
    while compiling you should not get this error.

    LK:041

    Unable to find %s model &#060;%s&#062;
    ----------------------------
    DLink is unable to find the specified object module or library.
    DLink will attempt to find the library verbatim and with a suffix
    based on the current memory model.

    LK:042

    Cannot frag when using -r
    -------------------------
    DLink must use the small-data and small-code models when generating
    residentable code.

    LK:043

    Bad option: %s
    --------------
    DLink has been given a bad command line option

    LK:044

    Unable to open %s
    -----------------
    DLink was unable to open the specified file or, if a library, the
    file plus an appropriate suffix based on the memory model.

    LK:045

    Error 253 (%d)
    --------------
    Indicates a software error within DLink.

    LK:046

    Unable to create %s
    -------------------
    DLink was unable to create the specified file.

    LK:047

    Read error on %s
    ----------------
    DLink got an error while reading the specified file.

    LK:051

    Illegal Hunk addr=%08lx type=%08lx MAJOR HEADING=%s
    ---------------------------------------------------
    DLink has come across an illegal hunk, usually due to internal memory
    corruption (i.e. a software error of some sort)

    LK:052

    Object size mismatch in %s
    --------------------------
    This normally indicates a corrupted object module or library.  The
    module or library is shorter then expected.

    LK:053

    Unknown symbol type %d sym=%.*s
    -------------------------------
    DLink has come across a symbol of unknown type.  This message is
    pretty much the same as LK:013.

    LK:054

    16 bit data relocation out of range (%d) sym=%.*s in %s
    -------------------------------------------------------
    DLink is unable to relocate a small-data reference due to there being
    more then 64KBytes of data.  You may have to switch to using the
    large data model or to qualifying some of your declarations as __far.
