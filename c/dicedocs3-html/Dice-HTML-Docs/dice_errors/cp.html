 CP:001

 No input file specified
 -----------------------
 DCPP was run without any input file specification

 CP:002

 Unable to create %s
 -------------------
 DCPP Was unable to create the requested output file.  This is
 normally a temporary file.

 CP:003

 Unknown directive
 -----------------
 DCPP has encountered a # directive which is unknown to it.

 CP:004

 Maximum number of #if levels (%d) exceeded
 ------------------------------------------
 You may only have up to 256 levels of #if nesting

 CP:006

 Multiple #else's for an #if, suggest #elif
 ------------------------------------------
 This normally indicates a mistake in constructing complex
 #if/#elif/#else/#endif sequences.

 CP:007

 #endif without associated #if
 -----------------------------
 Occurs when you have an #endif without a matching #if.

 CP:009

 #error directive: %.*s
 ----------------------
 The #error directive has been encountered.  This directive is defined
 to generate an error on purpose and used by programmers for that
 express purpose.

 CP:010

 Maximum number of #include/macro levels (%d) exceeded
 -----------------------------------------------------
 DCPP can handle up to 32 levels of includes and macro nestings.

 CP:011

 File Size mismatch %s (%d)
 --------------------------
 This error should never occur and, if it does, is probably indicative
 of problems elsewhere in the system.  Essentially, DCPP uses Seek()
 to determine the size of the file then Read()s it in.  If the numbers
 don't match you get this error.

 CP:012

 Ran out of memory!
 ------------------
 DCPP has run out of memory.  This does not normally occur as DCPP
 uses the least memory of all the main compiler executables.  This can
 occur if you do not have much memory in the system, though.  There
 are a number of things that can be done to fix the situation... try
 using precompiled includes, try specifying a temporary directory (-T
 option to DCC) that is not in RAM:

 CP:013

 Read Error from %s
 ------------------
 A read error occured while DCPP was attempting to read a file.

 CP:014

 stringtize '#' valid only before macro argument in a #define
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 You may only stringtize a macro argument as in:

 #define stringof(fubar) #fubar

 Attempting to stringtize other tokens is illegal

 CP:015

 unterminated #if's left over from include after EOF: %d/%d
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 One or more #if's was left unclosed (i.e. no matching #endif) at the
 end of a file. While you can nest #include's in #if's you cannot
 start an #if in an #include and #endif it outside that #include.

 CP:016

 Unexpected EOF (unterminated comment?)
 --------------------------------------
 A comment was left unterminated when the file EOF occured.  This can
 also occur if you forget an end quote.

 CP:017

 Software Error line 177
 -----------------------
 This an other software errors generally indicate a bug in DCPP.  It
 is possible to get software errors from illegal files that generate
 situations which confuse DCPP.

 CP:018,CP:019

 Unterminated double quoted string, Unterminated single quoted character constant
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Unterminated string and/or character constants were detected.

 CP:020

 Read Error on precompiled header file
 -------------------------------------
 A read error occured reading a precompiled header file.

 CP:021

 Error parsing precompiled header file
 -------------------------------------
 This indicates a software error of some sort with the precompiled
 header routines.  DICE automatically discards precompiled headers
 that do not match the version of the compiler in use so this error
 message will only be generated if DCPP really gets confused somehow.

 CP:022

 Can't seek in output file
 -------------------------
 You must specify a disk file as the output file for DCPP.  DCPP must
 often seek in the output file.

 CP:023

 No symbol specified for #undef
 ------------------------------
 You have an #undef directive which specifies no symbol to undef

 CP:024

 Illegal NULL symbol in defined macro
 ------------------------------------
 You have somehow managed to define a 0 length symbol.   This is
 usually indicative of a syntax error somewhere.

 CP:025

 Maximum number of macro arguments (%d) exceeded
 -----------------------------------------------
 Macros cannot deal with more then 256 arguments.  There is no limit
 on the size of a macro.

 CP:026,CP:027

 Expected comma
 Expected closing paren
 -------------------------------------
 Generally occurs when parsing macros, a comma or closing paren was
 expected.

 CP:028

 Software error in macro replace: %d/%d %d/%d
 --------------------------------------------
 Again, this indicates a software error somewhere in the routine that
 handles argument substitution.  While it is most likely due to an
 illegal macro it could also be due to problem with DCPP.

 CP:029

 Recursive use of macro &#060;macroMAJOR HEADING&#062;
 -------------------------------------------
 You called a macro recursively, this would lead to an infinite loop.

 CP:030

 Unexpected EOF in macro %s
 --------------------------
 This can occur if a macro contains an unterminated comment or string.

 CP:031

 Macro crosses #include boundary
 -------------------------------
 A weird error you should never get.  There are a few situations where
 DCPP is not ANSI compatible (due to the way DCPP recurses through
 macros) which will generate this error message.

 CP:033

 Not enough arguments to macro: %d/%d
 ------------------------------------
 You referenced a macro which needs more arguments then you supplied!

 CP:034

 Expected closing paren, got '%c' in macro %s (too many args?)
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 You have most likely specified more arguments then the macro takes.
 This can also occur if unexpected characters are encountered when
 processing a macro.

 CP:035

 Software Error (Creator)
 ------------------------
 DCPP has gotten confused

 CP:036

 Software Error in macro %s symbol %s
 ------------------------------------
 DCPP has gotten confused

 CP:037

 Software Error in allocator %d
 ------------------------------
 DCPP has gotten very confused

 CP:038

 GetNominalInclude() failed
 --------------------------
 This indicates a problem openning an #include file.  Normally you
 should get a 'Can't open file' and not this message.

 CP:039,CP:040,CP:041

 Syntax error, Too many close parens, Expression too complex
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 These occur during DCPP expression parsing for #if's and are
 indicative of problems in your expression

 CP:042

 Error parsing expression
 ------------------------
 This is similar to a syntax error and indicates an improperly
 constructed expression.

 CP:043

 Error in #include line
 ----------------------
 DCPP was unable to parse the specified #include directive.  There are
 a few ANSI constructs, such as using macros in an #include directive,
 that DCPP has yet to support.

 CP:044

 Can't seek in precompiled header file
 -------------------------------------
 Indicates a general problem accessing a precompiled header file.
   
 CP:045
   
 Expected comma or close paren
 -----------------------------
 Another expression parsing error.  DCPP was expecting one thing and
 got something else.
   
 CP:046
   
 Expected close paren for macro %s
 ---------------------------------
 DCPP had a problem parsing the specified macro, looking for a close
 parenthesis and not finding one.

 CP:047

 Can't open file %.*s
 --------------------
 DCPP was unable to open the specified file.
