 stpchr

 FUNCTION
 Search for a character in a string (UNIX)

 SYNTAX
 #include &#060;string.h&#062;
 char *ptr = stpchr(s, c)
 const char *s;
 int c;

 DESCRIPTION
 This searches for the character c within the string pointed to by s.
 The terminating NULL at the end of s is NOT included in the search.
 A pointer to the first occurrence of c in s is returned or NULL if c
 could not be found. c is converted to a char by stpchr before
 beginning the search.

 || NOTE: It is better to use the ANSI standard strchr and strrchr
 || functions.

 INPUTS
 char *s;        pointer to string to search

 int c;          character to search for

 RESULTS
 char *ptr;      pointer to the first occurrence of the character
             c in s, or NULL if c could not be found in s.

 SEE ALSO
 strchr, strrchr

 EXAMPLE
 #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
 #include &#060;string.h&#062;
 #include &#060;assert.h&#062;
 main()
 {
    char *s = &quot;this is a test&quot;;
    char *ptr;
    ptr = stpchr(s, 'i');
    assert(ptr == s + 2);
    puts(ptr);      /*  &quot;is is a test&quot;  */
    return(0);
 }
