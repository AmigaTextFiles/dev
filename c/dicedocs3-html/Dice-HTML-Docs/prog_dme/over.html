                              <b>OVERVIEW</b>

 See REVISIONS section for revisions.  DME is an editor designed mainly for
 programmers.  Although it is not a word processor, it does include many
 word processing features such as Word-Wrap and automatic paragraph
 formatting.  Here is a quick 'features' list:

    -control language based on a rich command set accessed manually
     or via arbitrary mapping of keys.  (Every key may be mapped to 128
     different things via qualifier and mouse keys)

    -General variables, reference macros as variables, ENV: enviroment
     variables (1.30C and beyond).

    -fast visual response (it scrolls quickly)... even faster when
     BlitzFonts or similar text speedup utilities are installed.

    -title-line statistics showing your current position in the file,
     file name, whether the file has been modified or not, etc...

    -Multiple Windows, ability to iconify windows

    -Word Wrap and automatic paragraph formatting.

    -ability to map any KEY or MOUSE BUTTON combination.

 DME has been designed to allow easy expansion, and I intend to make many
 future improvments.  It has not been designed for user friendliness, but is
 straight forward if you read this document [care]fully.

 AS OF 1.40 and until further notice DME no longer takes command line
 arguments other than file arguments, or workbench based window arguments.
 DME used to take arguments to specify window dimensions.  Use the saveconfig
 command to setup default window parameters.

 The 1.40-41 Version is an experimental intermediate version, documentation may
 not be up to date.

 Normally, DME will automatically SOURCE two script files, S:.EDRC, and the
 .EDRC in your current directory. These files do not have to exist.  These
 script files usually contain mappings and do things (for example, turn on
 savetabs).
