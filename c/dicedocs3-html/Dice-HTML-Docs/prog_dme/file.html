                          <b>FILE PARTICULARS</b>

 No Matter what you set internal tabs to, tabs in disk files will be 8.
 This allows you to use your favorite tabs stops (mine are 4) and still
 have your disk files compatible with TYPE, a printer, etc...  DME by
 default doesn't bother to optimize when writing out files and simply uses
 spaces. If you (SAVETABS on) before saving (or in your S:.EDRC, etc...),
 DME will attempt to optimize the file by placing TABS in appropriate
 places.  DME will not place any TABS after the first single, back, or
 double quote is encountered in a line. If this does not cover every
 situation in your particular application that you want to be *sure* no tabs
 will occur in sensitive sections, then you should not use (SAVETABS on).

 It should be noted that since DME removes spaces at the end of the line,
 editing UUENCODED ascii files will not work for uuencoded lines which end
 with a space.  The nominal fix is to add an extra character after each
 uuencoded line (anything) in the proper column, which is ignored by the
 UUDECODE program.

 The command to save the current document under the default name is SAVEOLD,
 *not* SAVE.  SAVE is not a valid command.  This is to prevent people who
 have not read the documentation from assuming 'save' takes an argument (and
screwing up their work).  SAVEOLD does NOT take an argument, SAVEAS does.

 SAVEOLD/SAVEAS do not automatically backup the destination file.  If you
 are working in an enviroment where you are worried about ensuring a viable
 copy can be recovered if your Amiga crashes in the middle of the save, you
 can write a macro to save the file into two places.  Usually, people backup
 their working disks so this is not neccesary.

 Workbench Support:  If DME is run from the workbench, it will automatically
 construct an icon file when you save a document.  If run from a CLI, no
 icon file is generated.
