                         <b>WORKBENCH SUPPORT</b>

 DME V1.26 and beyond support the workbench in the following way:  (1) you
 can click on the DME icon to bring up DME with the file &quot;unnamed&quot;. (2) you
 can select one or more standard ascii documents which have DME as the
 default tool.  If DME has no knowlege of a text icon, it uses its own.
 Command line arguments are passed to DME via the tooltypes entries for
 DME's application icon or via individual document icons.  The following
 format is used:  (This is a hack, no?)

    ****** WARNING, 1.40-41, most workbench options do not work.

    ARG=flag

    See the OVERVIEW section for allowed flags.  Only one argument per line
    is allowed (sorry).  The tooltypes for the application icon are
    processed first, then the tooltypes for each document icon are
    processed before each file is loaded.

    ARG= -t10
    ARG= -l10
