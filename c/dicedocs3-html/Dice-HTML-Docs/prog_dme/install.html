                            <b>INSTALLATION</b>

 The NULL: device must be mounted to be able to use the EXECUTE command.
 This is so EXECUTE works even if the console window goes away.  Otherwise,
 simply put DME in an accessable location (usually C:).  Put the dme.icon
 file in the same directory as DME if you want to access the application
 from the workbench (dme.icon is not needed if accessed from a CLI or shell).

 People appear to have problems using the EXECUTE command when DME is run
 from the workbench.  I have no solution yet.

 CONFIGURATION of default window placement, pen selection, and most editor
 modes (insert/overwrite, margin, etc...) is accomplished by bringing up
 DME, setting it up how you like, then selecting the SAVECONFIG menu
 option (saves to s:dme.config).
