 <b>CreateGlobalDiceRexxPort</b>

 FUNCTION
 Create a global ARexx port (DICE)

 SYNTAX
 #include &#060;lib/rexx.h&#062;
 rc = CreateGlobalDiceRexxPort(port, name)
 int rc;
 struct MsgPort *port;
 char *name;

 DESCRIPTION
 CreateGlobalDiceRexxPort integrates any number of ARexx ports beyond
 the master port into DICE's ARexx system. This call may be made from
 any point in your program. After this call returns the message port
 will accept incomming ARexx messages.

 || NOTE: For simple programs you can simply use the master port
 || (RexxPort) that DICE sets up for you automatically and need not
 || bother with creating additional ports.  This call is more of use
 || in more complex programs which handle multiple projects
 || simultaniously.

 If you had declared RexxHostName as NULL causing DICE to not
 initialize an internal default RexxPort, you can pass NULL for
 msgPort to initialize DICE's internal default RexxPort, thereby
 allowing PlaceRexxCommand calls that specify a NULL port (i.e. to use
 DICE's internal default RexxPort).  You are not required to use
 DICE's internal message port, it is simply convenient.

 INPUTS
 struct MsgPort *port;
             A blank msgPort structure (that is, totally
             zero'd out). DICE will fill the structure with
             appropriate values. DICE uses the same signal bit
             as it allocated for the master port (RexxPort).
             DICE will make this message port public through
             the AddPort() call.

 char *name;     A pointer to the name of the message port.  DICE
             uses this name verbatim.  An error (-1) is
             returned if the port already exists.  If you had
             passed NULL for the MsgPort structure DICE will
             initialize RexxHostName to name.

 RESULTS
 int r;          0 for success, -1 for error
