 DeleteDiceRexxPort

 FUNCTION
 Delete a DICE ARexx port (DICE)

 SYNTAX
 #include &#060;lib/rexx.h&#062;
 void DeleteDiceRexxPort(port)
 struct MsgPort *port;

 DESCRIPTION
 This call deletes a previously created DICE ARexx port. You may NOT
 delete any ARexx port while within DoRexxCommand().  This call may
 only be made from the top level of your program or you run the risk
 of deleted an ARexx port out from under yourself.

 ## WARNING: You may NOT delete the master ARexx port, only those you
 ## specifically create.

 This call automatically clears out any as yet unread messages on the
 port, removes the port from the public message list with RemPort(),
 and zero's the structure.

 INPUTS
 struct MsgPort *port;
             The message port to delete.  You must have
             created it using CreateGlobalDiceRexxPort or
             CreateDiceRexxPort
