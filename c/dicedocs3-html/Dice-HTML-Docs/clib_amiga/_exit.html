 <b>_exit</b>

 NAME
  _exit - exit from a program without bother to release resources

 SYNOPSIS
  (void) _exit(code)
  int code;

 FUNCTION
  exits the program and returns the specified exit code.  Normally you
  pass 0 to indicate no errors, a positive number to indicate a program
  error to the parent.  Note that since auto-init openned libraries
  are closed in the startup module (c.o), automatically openned
  libraries WILL be automatically closed for you.  However, any
  libraries you manually declare the library base variable for and
  manually open must be closed by you.

  You should only call _exit() if you used the _main() entry point
  (instead of the usual main()), and then only after releasing all
  resources (such as file handles openned with Open()).

 EXAMPLE
  /*
   *  This program comes to approximately a 552 byte executable
   */

  _main()
  {
      Write(Output(), &quot;OW!n&quot;, 4);
      _exit(1);
  }
