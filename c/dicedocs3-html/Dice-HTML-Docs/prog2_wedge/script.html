CREATING YOUR OWN WEDGE SCRIPTS AND ICONS

 NEW - The new LVO command's &quot;wedgeline&quot; option can be used with the Amiga
 FD files to automatically create command lines for WEDGE.  This is the
 easiest way to create a basic command line for WEDGE - much easier than
 figuring out the register bit patterns yourself.  Use LVO to create and
 redirect a basic wedge line to a file, then edit the file to change or
 add additional options.  LVO requires the assignment FD: to where you have
 stored the FD files.

 Example:  LVO &#062;s:availmem.w exec AvailMem wedgeline
          will create a script called availmem.w which contains:
 run wedge exec 0xff28 0x8002 0x8000 opt r   &quot;c=AvailMem(requirements)(d1)&quot;

 By executing the above script, you will wedge into the exec
 AvailMem function for all tasks, default serial output, with
 result values (opt r) shown.

 To create additional WEDGE icons, duplicate an existing icon, then go into
 the icon's INFO window to modify the TOOL TYPES arguments.

 Each icon is attached to a &quot;.w&quot; script file, so you should use ED or MEMACS
 to modify the script file attached to your icon.  If you do not, the script
 file will not install the desired WEDGE from CLI since it will be a
 duplicate of the script attached to the icon you copied.

 Offsets for all system library functions may be found in the Addison-Wesley
 ROM Kernel Reference Manual:  Includes and Autodocs.  The manual contains
 several representations of each offset.  Use the hex form that starts with
 &quot;0xf&quot;.  Or use the LVO command with the FD files to automatically
 generate LVO's or WEDGE command lines.
