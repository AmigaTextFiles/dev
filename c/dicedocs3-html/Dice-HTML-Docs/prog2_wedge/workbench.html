 RUNNING WEDGE FROM THE WORKBENCH

 You could make a Tool icon for Wedge, and/or Project icons with the
 Default Tool of Wedge if you want to use Wedge from Workbench.

 When WEDGE is run directly from the Workbench, the TOOL TYPES entries in the
 icon's INFO window determine which library and offset to monitor and which
 options are enabled/disabled.  To change an entry or add an option that is
 not listed, use the Workbench INFO function.  To bring up the INFO window,
 select a Wedge icon, then select the INFO option in the Workbench's first
 menu (the Workbench menu).  Use the scroll arrows, the add/delete gadgets,
 and the key board to add, delete or modify the icon's TOOL TYPE entries.

 The acceptable format for TOOLTYPES entries was included in the explanation
 of each option.  The TOOL TYPES default to:

    AmigaDOS argument       TOOL TYPE Default

    &#060;regs&#062;              REGS=0x0000
    &#060;ptrs&#062;              PTRS=0x0000
    l               LOCAL=FALSE
    p               PARALLEL=FALSE
    r               RESULT=FALSE
    a               RESULTP=FALSE
    s               STACK=FALSE
    x               EXCLUDE=FALSE
    &quot;t=tasklist&quot;            TASKS=ALL

 There are no default values for the library and offset arguments. These
 values MUST be supplied.



 SPECIAL WEDGE FUNCTIONS

 The following functions can be specified with a single CLI argument, a TOOL
 TYPES entry, or simply by double-clicking on the corresponding icon in the
 WEDGE window.
