 Format: WEDGE &#060;library&#062; &#060;offset&#062; [regs ptrs] [opt fklnprasxz u t=&#060;tasklist&#062;
        b=&#060;baud&#062; c=&#060;comment&#062; d=&#060;n&#062;]
    or  WEDGE LIST
    or  WEDGE KILLALL

 Template: WEDGE &quot;LIBRARY,OFFSET,REGS/K,PTRS/K,OPT/S,T=/K,B=/K,C=/K,D=/K&quot;

 Purpose: To monitor calls to any library function.

 Specification:

 WEDGE allows you to monitor the library function calls of system and
 application tasks.  This is useful for both debugging and the optimization
 of software. WEDGE reports the name and address of the task calling the
 function, the Forbid/Disable status, the register contents, data pointed to
 by registers, stack, and the function return value.

 You can restrict reporting to a list of tasks, and you can also exclude a
 list of tasks from reporting.  When in serial mode, Debug (ROMWACK) can be
 invoked either before or after the WEDGEd function.

 Wedge 37.1 adds SegTracker support, and reduced stack usage.
 (older versions of wedge can cause stack overflow crashes under
 2.1 and higher OS when locale.library is present).

 NOTE - The new Software Tools LVO command has a &quot;wedgeline&quot; option which
 can be used with the Amiga FD files to automatically create command lines
 for WEDGE.  This is the easiest way to create a basic command line for
 WEDGE - much easier than figuring out the register bit patterns yourself.
 See the final section on creating your own wedges for more information.
