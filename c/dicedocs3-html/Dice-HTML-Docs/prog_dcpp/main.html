                                <b>DCPP</b>
                           <i>C PREPROCESSOR</i>


 dcpp sourcefile [-o outfile] [-I includedir ...] &#060;options&#062;

 DCPP automatically scans DINCLUDE:, DINCLUDE:PD/, and DINCLUDE:AMIGA/ .
 Any -I option directories are searched in sequence BEFORE DCPP's
 default search path.  The last default directory, DINCLUDE:AMIGA/, may
 be modified with the -1.x and -2.x options, see below.

 Note that DINCLUDE:PD/ (added after version *.11) is meant to be a
 place to put public domain header files so as not to clutter the
 top level DINCLUDE: directory.

 As with all DCC commands, the space between the option and an
 associated file/dir argument is optional.

 DCPP probably does not implement everything perfectly and might fail on
 some constructions.

 DCC normally runs DCPP before DC1

             CPP.DOC

 The following symbols are defined by default

 mc68000         -running on a 68000

 _DCC            -'DCC' compiler

 __STDC__        -ANSI __STDC__

 AMIGA           -AMIGA computer


            Options to CPP

 -1.N
 -2.N
     This option selects the OS.  If not specified, DCPP searches
     dinclude:amiga for amiga includes.  If specified, DCPP searches
     dinclude:amiga1N or dinclude:amiga2N for amiga includes
     instead.

     DCC supports this option and passes it along to dcpp.  This
     allows developers to compile under either 1.3 or 2.0 (or
     whatever) with the flick of an option.  DCC also uses a
     different amiga.lib (see DCC docs).

 -d[#]
     This option turns on DCPP debugging

 -o[ ]file
     This option sets the output file, otherwise stdout is used.
     the space is optional

 -ffp
     Passed from DCC, tells preprocessor to define _FFP_FLOAT.
     If not specified, preprocessor defines _SP_FLOAT.  This
     exists to better support alternate floating point models
     in header files.

 -D[ ]define[=stuff]
     This option predefines a symbol or macro.

 -E file
     specify stderr file, any errors are appended to the file
     instead of to stdout.  Useful for batch compiles

 -U
     This option undefines the following symbols:

     __STDC__
     mc68000
     _DCC
     AMIGA

 -H&#060;precompoutfile&#062;=&#060;headerfile&#062;

 Enable use/creation of precompiled header files.  Example:

 -Ht:defs.m=defs.h

 see DCC.DOC for more information.

 -I0
     This option causes DCPP to *NOT* include any default
     directories in the include search list.

 -I[ ]dir
     This option adds the specified directory to the include search
     list.  A hanging slash on the end of the path is not required.
     The space is optional.

 -//
     Enable C++ style // comments.  The remainder of the line after
     // is encountered is interpreted as a comment.  This differs
     from /* style commenting in that no explicit comment-terminator
     is required.

 -notri
     Disable tri-graph scan pass.  Note that the tri-graph pass is
     implemented in assembly and does not slow down preprocessing in
     any noticable fashion, you should not disable tri-graphs unless
     you need to.
