This was one of the areas that we thought should be beefed up, due to the
lack of real programming tutorials, books etc. The beginners will have real
problems, so these are what we came up with. Yes I know there are two simple
tutorials in the introduction section but this is the main section for all
that kind of stuff and it also contains the sources so that you don't have
to type them all in.
