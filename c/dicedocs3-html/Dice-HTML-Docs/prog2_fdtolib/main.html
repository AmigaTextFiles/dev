                              <b>FDTOLIB</b>


 SYNOPSIS
 FDTOLIB files/wildcard.fd [-h hdrfile] -o libname [-mr] [-mD] &#060;more_opts)

 files/wildcard.fd   specifies one or more files and/or AmigaDOS
         wildcarding that represents the .FD files that
         are to be processed into a library

 -h hdrfile      hdrfile is a .H files that #include's all
         prototypes associated with the FD files.  It
         is only used if the -mr option is specified

 -o libname      specify output library name

 -mr         specify that a REGISTERED call interface library
         is to be generated (for DICE -m[r,R,RR] options),
         else generates a normal stack-args interface
         library.

 -mD         specify large-data model, else small-data model

 -I include-dir  passed to DCC

 -p prefix       Set prefix (currently only for standard generation,
         doesn't work with -mr).  The default is a single
         unscore.  This option is normally used to generate
         _hyper_ tags for dynamic.library

 -prof       Generate profiling code for the tags.  This will
         cause all library calls to be profiled when the
         program that links with this library is run.

 -auto library   Generate auto-init code for library after the
         tags.  &#060;library&#062; in this case is the name of
         the shared library.  For example, -auto fubar.library

 -AUTO library   Generate ONLY auto-init code for library (do
         not generate tags)

 DESCRIPTION

 FDTOLIB will create an amiga standard library out of specified .FD
 files (for example, you can generate most of amiga.lib by using
 the .FD files on your 1.3 Extras disk).

 Basically, FDTOLIB will generate one of four types of libraries:

 default     small-data model
 -mD     large-data model
 -mr     small-data model + DICE registered parameters entry pts
 -mr -mD     large-data model + DICE registered parameters entry pts

 If -mr is used suitable prototypes must be specified with the -h option.
 In this case, FDTOLIB will run DCC with a special option to have it
 generate a register-specification file for it to match up again the
 FD files.

 FDTOLIB then proceeds to scan the .FD files, creating temporary
 assembly files in T: and assembling them with DAS, then appending
 them to the output library and deleting the scratch files.  This
 step occurs for each function in each .FD files.

 (For faster operation, you will want to make DAS resident for the
 duration)

 If -mr was specified, FDTOLIB only generates library entries for
 those routines for which a prototype exists.  At the end of the
 run FDTOLIB will report any routines which existed in the .FD files
 but did not have a prototype.
