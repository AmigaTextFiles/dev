                    Projects Currently Under Development
                    ------------------------------------

- General cleaning up of system files and making it more user-friendly.
  Possibly a MUI type of interface look for DICE. Will help to make using
  DICE easier.

- A MUI-based Project Manager (currently BETA) is available.
  This will integrate with GoldED and hopefully others.
  Please bear in mind that it isn't generally for public use (especially
  since it's only BETA anyway)!
  - However if you want it you can get it from Richards web site.

- Advanced tutorials (for those who know the basics of C and want to go
  one step further!)

- DICE Support Web Page. Will include:-

  = A FAQ page (amongst others) where users of DICE will see their
    questions...ANSWERED! (We hope)

  = Should have some sort of link to the DICE mailing list

  = Various example programs to download or try - ours and the publics

  = Anything else we can come up with! :)

- And of course, constant updating of the docs - adding...all sorts of
  wonderful things!

- Also check Richards web site for more stuff...

If you need to contact me about spelling, corrections, ideas, etc. or just

Any major suggestions to the guide or docs should be addressed (sent) to
Matthew (<a href="mailto:Matthew.Fletcher@student.shu.ac.uk">Matthew.Fletcher@student.shu.ac.uk</a>) as he is the main document
editor (I am the humble slave :&#062; who does general &quot;refining&quot; and checking!)

Thanks,
