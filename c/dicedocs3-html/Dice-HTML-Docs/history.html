When this guide was begun. At the moment, it is just a quick tester. only an
Amigaguide front end to the mass of out of date and messy text documents
that reside in the docs drawer. This was 0.1 (I wonder what would happen if
you were to check the version from the shell ???) and was mailed of to
Richard for abuse and maybe some comments.

In hindsight, the layout for the the previous version was a bit crap, anyway
it was totally re-done and with much pain and effort was re-designed and
made in a more professional manner, (i.e. it has working prev / next and an
index buttons) now. It is at times like this that I wish that the &quot;search&quot;
code that exists within v40 datatype library worked, as the index is going
to be massive and will take an age to load / scroll on anything other than a
060. I also noticed a nasty problem, the backslash does not appear in my
guides. I have tried lots of fonts but I think it could be an Amigaguide
problem?

The guide has just about been converted now all that needs doing is to
update the contents (shock horror) for any new releases.. Also i have
had a few people point out rarther embrasing errors on my part but its
all for a good cause.

Still fiddling, infact it could be considered a major re-design of the
whole interface, but anyway,.. cut out loads of duplication.
