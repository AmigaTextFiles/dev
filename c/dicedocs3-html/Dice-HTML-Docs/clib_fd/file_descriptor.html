  file_descriptor

  A file descriptor is the lowest portable access to the file system a
  C program may make.  file descriptors are used with open, read, write,
  close, etc...  A file descriptor is unbuffered (that is, every operation
  goes to the kernel and does not get buffered locally).

  Remember that a file descriptor is different from a STDIO file pointer
  (see the file_pointer manual page) and an AmigaDOS file handle.
