 strspn

   NAME
    strspn  - scan a string until a character is found that does NOT match
          some character in a second string.

   SYNOPSIS
    int len = strspn(s, toks)
    const char *s;
    const char *toks;

   FUNCTION
    The string s is scanned until a character is found that does NOT
    match any character in the string toks.  The number of characters
    skipped is returned.  If every character in s matches some
    character in toks then the length of the string s is returned.

    This function is normally used to skip whitespace within a string.

   EXAMPLE
    #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
    #include &#060;string.h&#062;
    #include &#060;assert.h&#062;

    main()
    {
        int len;

        len = strspn(&quot;  t tt abcde test&quot;, &quot; t &quot;);
        assert(len == 7);               /*  stopped at the 'a'  */

        len = strspn(&quot;abcd &quot;, &quot; &quot;);
        assert(len == 0);

        len = strspn(&quot;   tt &quot;, &quot; t&quot;);
        assert(len == 6);               /*  all match, len = strlen(str);   */

        return(0);
    }

   INPUTS
    char *s;    pointer to string to scan
    char *toks; pointer to string containing characters to compare against

   RESULTS
    int len;  # of characters skipped in s before a match could not be found
