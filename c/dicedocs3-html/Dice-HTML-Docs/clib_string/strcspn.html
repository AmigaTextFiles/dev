 strcspn

   NAME
    strcspn - scan a string until a character is found that matches
          any character in a second string.

   SYNOPSIS
    int len = strcspn(s, toks)
    const char *s;
    const char *toks;

   FUNCTION
    The string s is scanned until a character is found that matches any
    character in the string toks.  The number of characters skipped is
    returned.  If no character in s matches any character in toks then
    the length of the string s is returned.

    This function is normally used to search for whitespace within a
    string.  Note that in many cases strpbrk() is more useful than
    strcspn().

   EXAMPLE
    #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
    #include &#060;string.h&#062;
    #include &#060;assert.h&#062;

    main()
    {
        int len;

        len = strcspn(&quot;hello this is a test&quot;, &quot; tabcd&quot;);
        assert(len == 5);               /*  stopped at the first space  */

        len = strcspn(&quot;hello this is a test&quot;, &quot; abl&quot;);
        assert(len == 2);               /*  stopped at the first 'l'    */

        len = strcspn(&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;abcd&quot;);
        assert(len == 5);               /*  stopped at end of string 1  */

        return(0);
    }

   INPUTS
    char *s;    pointer to string to scan
    char *toks; pointer to string containing characters to compare against

   RESULTS
    int len;    # of characters skipped in s before a match was found
