 strrchr

   NAME
    strrchr - search for a character in a string, scan backwards

   SYNOPSIS
    char *ptr = strrchr(s, c)
    const char *s;
    int c;

   FUNCTION
    Searches for the character c within the string pointed to by
    s.  The terminating nul at the end of s is included in the search.
    The string is searched backwards

    A pointer to the LAST occurance of c in s is returned or NULL
    if c could not be found.

    c is converted to an 8 bit quantity by strrchr().

   NOTE
    The ANSI spec does not say anything about including the nul
    character in the search for strrchr and some implementation
    may thus not implement this properly.

   EXAMPLE
    #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
    #include &#060;string.h&#062;
    #include &#060;assert.h&#062;

    main()
    {
        char *s = &quot;this is a test&quot;;
        char *ptr;

        ptr = strrchr(s, 'i');
        assert(ptr == s + 5);

        puts(ptr);              /*  &quot;is a test&quot;  */

        ptr = strrchr(s, 'x');
        assert(ptr == NULL);

        return(0);
    }

   INPUTS
    char *s;    pointer to the string to search
    int c;      character to search for

   RESULTS
    char *ptr;  pointer to the last occurance of character c in
            s or NULL if c could not be found in s.
