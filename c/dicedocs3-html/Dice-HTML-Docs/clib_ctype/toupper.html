 <b>toupper</b>

 NAME
  toupper - converts a character into upper case

 SYNOPSIS
  int lc = toupper(c);
  int c;

  This is a MACRO if you #include &#060;ctype.h&#062;, a subroutine call if
  you do not.

 FUNCTION
  If the character is in lower case the equivalent upper case
  character is returned, else the argument is returned (i.e. no
  change)

 NOTE
  When a non-zero value is returned, this value can be *anything*
  other than zero.  It is not necessarily a 1.  It is guarenteed to
  fit in a short, however, and still remain non-zero.

  characters in the 128-255 range are valid inputs.  characters
  less than -1 or larger than 255 are ILLEGAL and the results will
  be random.  If you are passing a CHAR, you must cast it to an
  UNSIGNED CHAR first.

  EOF is a valid input an always returns false

 EXAMPLE
  #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
  #include &#060;ctype.h&#062;


  main()
  {
      printf(&quot;%c%c%c%c&quot;, toupper('a'), toupper('B'), toupper('%'), toupper('Q'));
  }

 INPUTS
  int c;      character that we are checking

 RESULTS
  int r;      converted character
