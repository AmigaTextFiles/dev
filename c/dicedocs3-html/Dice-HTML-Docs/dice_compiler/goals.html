 In writing DICE my goals are as follows: <i>Matt Dillion</i>

- reasonably fast compilation.  Modular executables for ease of use,
  reliability, and testability.

- concentrate more on reliability and less on optimizations.  Remember that
  this is only the third major distribution of DICE, I expect some bugs
  to show up.  I expect to become more reliable than the two other
  commercial C compilers in the Amiga market within a year.

- but do not forget optimizations... put in relatively easy to implement
  optimizations that do not destroy the reliability of DICE.  DICE does
  no common sub-expression or loop unrolling optimizations, but does do
  relatively smart register allocation and multi-level history to
  propogate conditional expressions.

- provide comprehensive support of the Amiga, especially for new
  versions of the OS that come out.  DICE fully supports 1.3 and 2.0
  with an easy extension mechanism to allow development on several
  OS versions / betas simultaniously.

- I have always torn my hair out at not being able to easily fix bugs in
  the support libraries for commercial compilers.  DICE includes full
  source for its support libraries (c.lib, m.lib, auto.lib) and a means
  to remake the library.  DICE also includes full source to some of
  its own utilities, namely LIBTOS and the DCC frontend which are the
  most likely candidates for programmer hair loss.
