<b>SMALL DATA AMIGA.LIB</b>

DICE uses a small-data model version of Commodore's AMIGA.LIB to allow it 
to generate residentable executables (-r option to DCC). The small data
amiga.lib, called AMIGAS13.LIB (note the 's') is generated from the large 
modem amiga.lib with the LIBTOS program. (under 2.0 it's AMIGAS20.LIB)

The source to the LIBTOS program is available to allow developers using 
DICE to add new base variables to LIBTOS's search list when new operating 
systems come out without having to wait for my update.

WARNING!!  Commodore screwed up the var-args entry points in the 2.0 
amiga.lib, such as CreateNewProcTags().  To ensure that you get tags that 
work properly, you must remake the 2.0 's' library from the library source
archive after installing updates from commodore. The DICE library source 
overides these var-args tags with ones that work.
