<b>Organization of includes and libraries, default:</b>
These are the standard ANSI C-libray functions.

<i>DINCLUDE:</i>
The location of top level includes such as stdio.h

<i>DINCLUDE:Amiga13/</i>
The proper location of 1.3 amiga includes, -1.3 option must be used with DCC 
or set in ENV:DCCOPTS or you will get trash when you try to compile. It is
probably also worth saying that you can have the includes anywhere, as long
as you make the assign properly.

<i>DINCLUDE:Amiga20/</i>
The location of 2.0 amiga includes, -2.0 option must be used with DCC or set 
in ENV:DCCOPTS.

<i>DINCLUDE:Amiga30/</i>
I wonder what these could be ?, humm ?, it is worth noteing that if you like
me have never even seen a 1.3 include then dont worry, i just have all the
3.0 inludes dumped straght into DINCLUDE: and it al works just fine.

NOTE !!! Amiga 1.3 and 2.0 includes should be placed in the subdirectory 
dinclude:Amiga13 and dinclude:amiga20, that is, dinclude:Amiga13/Exec/*.h, 
dinclude:Amiga13/graphics/*.h, etc...

    <i>DCC references startup and libraries to DLIB:</i>

    <i>DLIB:amigas13.lib</i>  A small-data model version of the 1.3 AMIGA.LIB
    <i>DLIB:amigas20.lib</i>  A small-data model version of the 2.0 AMIGA.LIB
    <i>DLIB:cs.lib</i>        The main C library for which you have source code
    <i>DLIB:ms.lib</i>        The math library
    <i>DLIB:auto.lib</i>      The auto library-open library
    <i>DLIB:c.o</i>           The startup module
    <i>DLIB:x.o</i>           The terminator module
