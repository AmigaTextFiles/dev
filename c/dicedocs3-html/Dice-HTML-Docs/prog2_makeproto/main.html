                             <b>MAKEPROTO</b>

    
 GENERAING PROTOTYPES

 MAKEPROTO [-o outputfile] srcfile srcfile srcfile...

 This has nothing to do with Lattice's prototype generation options.
 With a little more work, using MakeProto to mesh multiple source
 modules together is clean and easy to use.

 makeproto is not a magic program.  In fact, source is available
 in DCC2:DUTIL/MAKEPROTO.C .  All it does is scan the specified
 source files for 'Prototype' lines and write them to the specified
 output file.  A good example of the use of MAKEPROTO is the DME SOURCE
 (DCC3:DME.LZH).  NOTE: use -x -r when extracting DME.LZH .  The DME
 source also includes a good example of a DMakefile.

 Basically, each file should include a .H file, lets call it DEFS.H .
 DEFS.H contains the following two defines:

 #define Prototype   extern
 #define Local       static

 DEFS.H also, at the end, contains a line similar to this:

 #include &quot;prog-protos.h&quot;

 What you want to do is set up a dependancy in your DMakefile, Makefile,
 or whatever such that whenever any source files change, MAKEPROTO is
 run over all source files to create a new version of &quot;prog-protos.h&quot;.
 MAKEPROTO simply extracts 'Prototype' lines from the source files.

 Thus, for each source file, you supply a list of Prototype and Local
 lines at the beginning of the file which describe the functions that
 appear later on and prototypes them for other source modules;

 --------------------    FOO.C --------------------

 #include &quot;defs.h&quot;

 Prototype int MYGlobalRoutine(char *);

 Local void SomeForwardRefdRoutine(void);

 int
 MyGlobalRoutine(str)
 char *str;
 {
 SomeForwardRefdRoutine();
 return(str + 1);
 }

 Local void
 SomeForwardRefdRoutine(void)
 {
 /* whatever */
 }

 --------------------


 The system is clean because prototypes for routines are defined in
 the same source file as the routines themselves.  To generate a
 prototype file for the above source module and, say, a few others,
 the sequence is:

 1&#062; makeproto -o prog-protos.h foo.c main.c x.c bar.c fubar.c
