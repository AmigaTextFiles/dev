 FUNCTION
 Build Index File for Online Help System

 SYNOPSIS
 MakeIndex outfile pattern

 DESCRIPTION
 MakeIndex builds a lookup file for the DICEHelp online help system.
 This file is normally called &quot;s:dicehelp.index&quot;. Entries are always
 appended to outfile to allow building the index file in steps.  Any
 number of files may be specified with wildcards in pattern. MakeIndex
 detects DICE documentation, AutoDoc files from Commodore, C include
 files and Assembler include files. Documentation files are indexed by
 the name of the function.  C include files are indexed by structures.
 The names of assembler includes are recorded, but no additional
 processing is done.

 MakeIndex is normally run during the installation, or later by
 selecting the installer option &quot;refresh DICEHelp index file.&quot;  You
 may append your own selections using MakeIndex.
