 FUNCTION
 Distribution Maker

 SYNOPSIS
 DUPDATE dist-file dest-dir [options] [DISTFILE distfilename]

 DESCRIPTION
 DUPDATE is a program that creates distributions.  It creates an exact
 duplicate of the source directory tree in the destination with
 modifications according to control files in the tree.  DUPDATE
 deletes files in the destination tree that do not exist in the source
 and updates files from the source into the destination tree that have
 been modified since the last dupdate (or copies them fresh if they do
 not exist).

  FORCE  DUPDATE will not ask permission to copy a fresh file

  QUIET  DUPDATE will not display verbose output

  NODEL  DUPDATE will not delete files in the destination that do not
     exist in the source.

  DISTFILE file
  Specify alternate control file that 'modifies' the dist update,
  default is .DistFiles

  If a file &quot;.DistFiles&quot; exists in any directory of the source
  tree, updating of the destination is modified according to the
  file.  This is a text file which may specify additional
  files/directories to add to the destination directory (pulled
  from other random places), files and directories NOT to include
  in the destination tree, or a list of specific files to include
  (where files not listed are not included).

  By using the DISTFILE file option you can generate different
  distributions for different purposes all based in the same source
  tree.  For example, I have a DISTFILE set to create the
  registered and non-registered DICE distributions and other
  DISTFILE files (using different names) to create the three
  floppies in the registered distribution.

  In the first format, if the ONLY keyword is specified after the
  first file name only these files / sub-directories will be
  included from this directory.  No other files will be copied

  file_or_dir_name ONLY
  file_or_dir_name
  file_or_dir_name
  file_or_dir_name
  file_or_dir_name

  The second format allows files/directories to be made part of the
  destination tree that do not necessarily exist in the current
  directory. Additionally, specific files/directories that do exist
  in the current directory can be excluded.  Any file/dir not
  explicitly unincluded using the 'no' keyword will be copied.
