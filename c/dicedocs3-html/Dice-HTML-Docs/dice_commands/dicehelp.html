 FUNCTION
 Fast Online Help Utility

 SYNOPSIS
 DICEHelp searchitem

 DESCRIPTION
 DICEHelp can quickly retrieve help on any DICE topic.  From a CLI,
 simply type your request as above.  From the Workbench, just click on
 the DICEHelp icon.

 Within many text editors, &quot;hotkeys&quot; have been established to link
 with DICEHelp.  A key will either search for information on the word
 under the cursor, or bring up a box for your selection.  DICEHelp
 uses a &quot;fuzzy&quot; search, so your never have to worry about getting the
 correct case or suffix.
