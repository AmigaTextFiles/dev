 FUNCTION
 Check out RCS Source;

 SYNOPSIS
 co [ options ] file ...

 DESCRIPTION
 Co retrieves a revision from each RCS file and stores it into the
 corresponding working file.  Each file name ending in ,v is taken to
 be an RCS file; all other files are assumed to be working files.  If
 only a working file is given, co tries to find the corresponding file
 in the RCS directory and then in the current directory.  For more
 details, see the file naming section below.

 Revisions of an RCS file may be checked out locked or unlocked.
 Locking a revision prevents overlapping updates.  A revision checked
 out for reading or processing (e.g., compiling) need not be locked.
 A revision checked out for editing and later checkin must normally be
 locked.  Co with locking fails if the revision to be checked out is
 currently locked by another user.  (A lock may be broken with the rcs
 command.)  Co with locking also requires the caller to be on the
 access list of the RCS file, unless he is the owner of the file or
 the superuser, or the access list is empty.  Co without locking is
 not subject to accesslist restrictions, and is not affected by the
 presence of locks.

 A revision is selected by options for revision or branch number,
 checkin date/time, author, or state.  When the selection options are
 applied in combination, co retrieves the latest revision that
 satisfies all of them.  If none of the selection options is
 specified, co retrieves the latest revision on the default branch
 (normally the trunk, see the -b option of rcs).  A revision or branch
 number may be attached to any of the options -f, -l, -p, -q, -r, or
 -u. The options -d (date), -s (state), and -w (author) retrieve from
 a single branch, the selected branch, which is either specified by
 one of -f,..., -u, or the default branch.

 A co command applied to an RCS file with no revisions creates a
 zero-length working file.  co always performs keyword substitution
 (see below).

-r[rev]  retrieves the latest revision whose number is less than or equal
     to rev.  If rev indicates a branch rather than a revision,
     the latest revision on that branch is retrieved.  If rev is
     omitted, the latest revision on the default branch (see the -b
     option of rcs) is retrieved. rev is composed of one or more
     numeric or symbolic fields separated by ..  The numeric
     equivalent of a symbolic field is specified with the -n option of
     the commands ci and rcs.

-l[rev]  same as -r, except that it also locks the retrieved revision for
     the caller.  See option -r for handling of the revision number
     rev.

-u[rev]  same as -r, except that it unlocks the retrieved revision (if it
     was locked by the caller).  If rev is omitted, -u retrieves the
     latest revision locked by the caller; if no such lock exists, it
     retrieves the latest revision on the default branch.

-f[rev]  forces the overwriting of the working file; useful in connection
     with -q.  See also the section on file modes below.

-p[rev]  prints the retrieved revision on the standard output rather than
     storing it in the working file.  This option is useful when co is
     part of a pipe.

-q[rev]  quiet mode; diagnostics are not printed.

 -ddate  retrieves the latest revision on the selected branch whose
     checkin date/time is less than or equal to date.  The date and
     time may be given in free format and are converted to local time.
     Examples of formats for date:

     22-April-1982
     17:20-CDT
     2:25 AM
     Dec.  29, 1983
     Tue-PDT, 1981
     4pm Jul 21 (free format)
     Fri, April 16 15:52:25 EST 1982 (output of ctime).

     Most fields in the date and time may be defaulted.  co determines
     the defaults in the order year, month, day, hour, minute, and
     second (most to least significant).  At least one of these fields
     must be provided.  For omitted fields that are of higher
     significance than the highest provided field, the current values
     are assumed.  For all other omitted fields, the lowest possible
     values are assumed.  For example, the date &quot;20, 10:30&quot; defaults
     to 10:30:00 of the 20th of the current month and current year.
     The date/time must be quoted if it contains spaces.

-sstate  retrieves the latest revision on the selected branch whose state
     is set to state.

[login]  retrieves the latest revision on the selected branch which was
     checked in by the user with login name login.  If the argument
     login is omitted, the caller's login is assumed.

joinlist
     generates a new revision which is the join of the revisions on
        joinlist. Joinlist is a comma-separated list of pairs of the form
        rev2:rev3, where rev2 and rev3 are (symbolic or numeric) revision
        numbers. For the initial such pair, rev1 denotes the revision
        selected by the above options -r, ..., -w.  For all other pairs,
        rev1 denotes the revision generated by the previous pair.  (Thus,
        the output of one join becomes the input to the next.)

        For each pair, co joins revisions rev1 and rev3 with respect to
        rev2.  This means that all changes that transform rev2 into rev1
        are applied to a copy of rev3.  This is particularly useful if
        rev1 and rev3 are the ends of two branches that have rev2 as a
        common ancestor.  If rev1 &#060; rev2 &#060; rev3 on the same branch,
        joining generates a new revision which is like rev3, but with all
        changes that lead from rev1 to rev2 undone.  If changes from rev2
        to rev1 overlap with changes from rev2 to rev3, co prints a
        warning and includes the overlapping sections, delimited by the
        lines

        &#060;&#060;&#060;&#060;&#060;&#060;&#060;
        rev1
        =======
        rev3
        &#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;

        For the initial pair, rev2 may be omitted.  The default is the
        common ancestor.  If any of the arguments indicate branches, the
        latest revisions on those branches are assumed.  The options -l
        and -u lock or unlock rev1.

    KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION
    Strings of the form $keyword$ and $keyword:...$ embedded in the text
    are replaced with strings of the form $keyword: value $, where
    keyword and value are pairs listed below.  Keywords may be embedded
    in literal strings or comments to identify a revision.

    Initially, the user enters strings of the form $keyword$.  On
    checkout, co replaces these strings with strings of the form
    $keyword: value$. If a revision containing strings of the latter form
    is checked back in, the value fields will be replaced during the next
    checkout.  Thus, the keyword values are automatically updated on
    checkout.

 FILE NAMING
 Pairs of RCS files and working files may be specified in 3 ways (see
 also the example section).

 1) Both the RCS file and the working file are given.  The RCS file
    name is of the form path1/workfile,v and the working file name is
    of the form path2/workfile, where path1/ and path2/ are (possibly
    different or empty) paths and workfile is a file name.

 2) Only the RCS file is given.  Then the working file is created in
    the current directory and its name is derived from the name of the
    RCS file by removing path1/ and the suffix ,v.

 3) Only the working file is given.  Then co looks for an RCS file of
    the form path2/RCS/workfile,v or path2/workfile,v (in this order).

 If the RCS file is specified without a path in 1) and 2), then co
 looks for the RCS file first in the directory RCS, then in the
 directory contained in the file RCS_LINK, followed by the current
 directory.

 EXAMPLES
 Suppose the current directory contains a subdirectory RCS with an RCS
 file io.c,v.  Then all of the following commands retrieve the latest
 revision from RCS/io.c,v and store it into io.c.

 co io.c
 co RCS/io.c,v
 co io.c,v
 co io.c RCS/io.c,v
 co io.c io.c,v
 co RCS/io.c,v io.c
 co io.c,v io.c

 FILE MODES
 If a file with the name of the working file exists already and has
 write permission, co aborts the checkout if -q is given, or asks
 whether to abort if -q is not given.  If the existing working file is
 not writable or -f is given, the working file is deleted without
 asking.

 DIAGNOSTICS
 The RCS file name, the working file name, and the revision number
 retrieved are written to the diagnostic output.  The exit status
 always refers to the last file checked out, and is 0 if the operation
 was successful, 1 otherwise.

 ci, ident, rcs, rcsdiff, rcsintro, rcsmerge, rlog, section .
   
 LIMITATIONS
 The option -d gets confused in some circumstances, and accepts no
 date before 1970.  There is no way to suppress the expansion of
 keywords, except by writing them differently.

 BUGS
 The option -j does not work for files that contain lines with a
 single ..
