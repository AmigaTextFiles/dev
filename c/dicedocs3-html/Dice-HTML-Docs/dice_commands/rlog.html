 FUNCTION
 Display RCS History
   
 SYNOPSIS
 rlog [ options ] file ...
   
 DESCRIPTION
 Rlog prints information about RCS files.  Files ending in ,v are RCS
 files, all others are working files.  If a working file is given,
 rlog will locate the corresponding RCS file.
   
 Rlog prints the following information for each RCS file: RCS file
 name, working file name, head (i.e., the number of the latest
 revision on the trunk), default branch, access list, locks, symbolic
 names, suffix, total number of revisions, number of revisions
 selected for printing, and descriptive text.  This is followed by
 entries for the selected revisions in reverse chronological order for
 each branch.  For each revision, rlog prints revision number, author,
 date/time, state, number of lines added/deleted (with respect to the
 previous revision), locker of the revision (if any), and log message.
 Without options, rlog prints complete information.  The options below
 restrict this output.
   
 -L  ignores RCS files that have no locks set; convenient in
     combination with -R, -h, or -l.
   
 -R  only prints the name of the RCS file; convenient for translating
     a working file name into an RCS file name.
   
 -h  prints only RCS file name, working file name, head, default
     branch, access list, locks, symbolic names, and suffix.
   
 -t  prints the same as -h, plus the descriptive text.
   
 -b  prints information about the revisions on the default branch
     (normally the highest branch on the trunk).
   
 -ddates  prints information about revisions with a checkin date/time in
     the ranges given by the semicolon- separated list of dates.  A
     range of the form d1&#060;d2 or d2&#062;d1 selects the revisions that were
     deposited between d1 and d2, (inclusive).  A range of the form &#060;d
     or d&#062; selects all revisions dated d or earlier.  A range of the
     form d&#060; or &#062;d selects all revisions dated d or later.  A range of
     the form d selects the single, latest revision dated d or
     earlier.  The date/time strings d, d1, and d2 are in the free
     format explained in co.  Quoting is sometimes necessary,
     especially for &#060; and &#062;.  Note that the separator is a semicolon.
   
 -l[lockers]
     prints information about locked revisions.  If the
     comma-separated list lockers of login names is given, only the
     revisions locked by the given login names are printed.  If the
     list is omitted, all locked revisions are printed.
   
 -rrevisions
     prints information about revisions given in the comma-separated
     list revisions of revisions and ranges.  A range rev1-rev2 means
     revisions rev1 to rev2 on the same branch, -rev means revisions
     from the beginning of the branch up to and including rev, and
     rev- means revisions starting with rev to the end of the branch
     containing rev.  An argument that is a branch means all revisions
     on that branch.  A range of branches means all revisions on the
     branches in that range.
   
 -sstates  prints information about revisions whose state attributes match
     one of the states given in the comma-separated list states.
   
 -w[logins]
     prints information about revisions checked in by users with login
     names appearing in the comma- separated list logins.  If logins
     is omitted, the user's login is assumed.
   
     Rlog prints the intersection of the revisions selected with the
     options -d, -l, -s, -w, intersected with the union of the
     revisions selected by -b and -r.
   
 EXAMPLES
 rlog -L -R RCS/*,v
 rlog -L -h RCS/*,v
 rlog -L -l RCS/*,v
 rlog RCS/*,v
   
 The first command prints the names of all RCS files in the
 subdirectory RCS which have locks.  The second command prints the
 headers of those files, and the third prints the headers plus the log
 messages of the locked revisions.  The last command prints complete
 information.
   
 DIAGNOSTICS
 The exit status always refers to the last RCS file operated upon, and
 is 0 if the operation was successful, 1 otherwise.
