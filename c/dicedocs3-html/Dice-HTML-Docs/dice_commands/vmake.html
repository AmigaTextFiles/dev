 FUNCTION
 Visual Interface to DICE

 DESCRIPTION
 VMake is a complete control center for DICE.  From within VMake you
 can manage a project, check files in or out of RCS, select files to
 edit, and finally compile and run your program.  VMake is an
 alternate to the CLI-based dcc program.  VMake is very flexible, and
 can be configured to control programs other than DICE.  See chapter
 for a full description.
