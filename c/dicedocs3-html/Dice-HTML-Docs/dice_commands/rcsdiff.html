 FUNCTION
 Compare RCS Revisions
   
 SYNOPSIS
 rcsdiff [ -biwt ] [ -cefhn ] [ -q ] [ -rrev1 ] [ -rrev2 ] file ...
   
 DESCRIPTION
 Rcsdiff runs diff to compare two revisions of each RCS file given.  A
 file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name, otherwise a working
 file name.  Rcsdiff derives the working file name from the RCS file
 name and vice versa, as explained in co.  Pairs consisting of both an
 RCS and a working file name may also be specified.
   
 The options -b, -i, -w, -t, -c, -e, -f, and -h, have the same effect
 as described in diff.
   
 -n  generates an edit script of the format used by RCS
   
 -q  Suppresses diagnostic output.
   
     If both rev1 and rev2 are omitted, rcsdiff compares the latest
     revision on the default branch (normally the highest branch on
     the trunk) with the contents of the corresponding working file.
     This is useful for determining what you changed since the last
     checkin.
   
     If rev1 is given, but rev2 is omitted, rcsdiff compares revision
     rev1 of the RCS file with the contents of the corresponding
     working file.
   
     If both rev1 and rev2 are given, rcsdiff compares revisions rev1
     and rev2 of the RCS file.
   
     Both rev1 and rev2 may be given numerically or symbolically, and
     may actually be attached to any of the options.
   
 EXAMPLES
 rcsdiff f.c
   
 The above command runs diff, comparing the currently checked out
 version with the latest revision stored on the current trunk.
   
 DIAGNOSTICS
 The exit status is 0 if there were no differences during the last
 comparison, 1 if there were differences, and 2 if there were errors.
