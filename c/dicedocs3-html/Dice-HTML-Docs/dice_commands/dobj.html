 FUNCTION
 Disassemble objects, executables, or Libraries
   
 SYNOPSIS
 DOBJ object_files [-o outfile] [-nd] [-nc] [-d[#]]
   
 DESCRIPTION
 DOBJ disassembles object modules and libraries into assembly.  DOBJ
 is useful for, say, finding bugs in an assembler.  Most DICE users
 will use DOBJ to browse through libraries and object modules, and
 perhaps to check DAS optimizations...  for example, branch
 optimizations will show up in disassembled object modules that are
 not otherwise apparent by looking at assembly output (DCC -a).
   
 DOBJ generates output to the console unless the -o option is used.
 The -d option is for debugging the DOBJ program itself and not
 normally used.
   
 filename
  redirect output
   
 -d[#]  Set debug level
   
 -nd  Do not show actual data, only display symbol names

 -nc  Do not disassemble actual code, only display symbol names

  DOBJ will replace hunk/offset references with symbol names when
  possible to yield a more readable output, and interprets each
  hunk according to its type (CODE, DATA, or BSS).

  There is NO limit to the size of the object file that may be
  disassembled, but it should be noted that DOBJ can take a while
  to resolve a large object file's symbols so be patient.  DOBJ
  does not take up much memory run-time, even when disassembling
  large object modules.

  ## WARNING: DOBJ does not does not understand any 68020/030
  ## instructions yet.
