 FUNCTION
 Strip Comments From Include Files

 SYNOPSIS
 ISTRIP destprefix wildcards

 DESCRIPTION
 ISTRIP will strip comments and extraneous whitespace from all files
 specified by wildcards and create an output file under the same name
 prefixed by destprefix. ISTRIP preserves the copyright notice, and
 replaces comments with blank lines to avoid changing any line
 numbering.

 ISTRIP is very stupid in that it will not create the destination
 directory hierarchy.  The COPY command in the example below basically
 does that for us, the copied files are extraneous and overwritten
 when ISTRIP is run.

 ISTRIP is useful mainly for developers who obtain later versions of
 the commented Amiga includes and want to create an uncommented
 version (The uncommented includes are much smaller, yielding faster
 compilation).

 EXAMPLE
 1&#062; copy dinclude:amiga13  ram:amiga13  ALL  QUIET
 1&#062; cd dinclude:
 1&#062; istrip  ram:  amiga13/#?/#?
