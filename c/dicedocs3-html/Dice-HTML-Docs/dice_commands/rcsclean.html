 FUNCTION
 Clean up RCS Work Files
   
 SYNOPSIS
 rcsclean [ -rrev ] [ -qrev ] file...
   
 DESCRIPTION
 Rcsclean removes working files that were checked out and never
 modified.  For each file given, rcsclean compares the working file
 and a revision in the corresponding RCS file.  If it finds no
 difference, it removes the working file, and, if the revision was
 locked by the caller, unlocks the revision.
   
 A file name ending in ',v' is an RCS file name, otherwise a working
 file name.  Rcsclean derives the working file name from the RCS file
 name and vice versa, as explained in co.  Pairs consisting of both an
 RCS and a working file name may also be specified.
   
 -r Rev  specifies with which revision the working file is compared.  If
     rev is omitted, rcsclean compares the working file with the
     latest revision on the default branch (normally the highest
     branch on the trunk).
   
 -q  suppresses diagnostics.
   
     Rcsclean is useful for &quot;clean&quot; targets in Makefiles.  Note that
     rcsdiff prints out the differences.  Also, ci normally asks
     whether to check in a file if it was not changed.
   
 EXAMPLES
 rcsclean *.c *.h
   
 The above command removes all working files ending in &quot;.c&quot; or &quot;.h&quot;
 that were not changed since their checkout.
   
 DIAGNOSTICS
 The exit status is 0 if there were no differences during the last
 comparison or if the last working file did not exist, 1 if there were
 differences, and 2 if there were errors.
