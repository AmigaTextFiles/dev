                          <b>DICE SYSTEM UTILITIES</b>


 Any third party orthors should get in contact with either me or Richard if
 want some publisity or just want so get more distibution.
 


 This is an overview of DICE utilities, please refer to individual
 manual pages for more information

 &#060;wildcard&#062; support exists for many commands.  This is an unanchored
 search and things like:     fubar/#?/#?  WILL WORK.


 <i>dobj objfile_or_library [-o outfile]</i>

 DOBJ disassembles object files and libraries.  There are no limitations
 to object or library file size.

 <i>cat &#060;wildcard&#062;</i>

 CAT types out one or more files as specified by the wildcard.  Startup
 is a bit slower than TYPE due to the directory scan.

 expand &#060;wildcard&#062;
 expand &#060;fmt&#062; &#060;wildcard&#062; ...

 EXPAND generates a list of files, one per line, using the specified
 &#060;fmt&#062; string (default &quot;%s&quot;).  This allows you to generate repetetive
 command sequences on a large number of files efficiently.

 1&#062; expand #?
 1&#062; expand &quot;fubar %s&quot; #?

 If you wish to specify more than one wildcard you MUST supply a
 format.  For example:

 1&#062; expand %s #?.c ram:#?

 libtos amiga.lib amigas.lib

 LIBTOS converts a large-data-model AMIGA.LIB into a small-data-model
 AMIGAS.LIB ... source is included in the LIB directory allowing
 modification to convert other libraries.

 A small-data model AMIGAS.LIB allows DICE to generate residentable
 code.

 <i>makeproto -o outfile file1 file2 ... fileN</i>

 MAKEPROTO is a cute utility to create a prototype file given a set
 of source files in a clean fashion, without relying on crazy compiler
 options.

 The idea is to create a DEFS.H file that all your source files include
 with all the stuff you normally stick in such a file plus the following
 defines:
   
 #define Prototype   extern
 #define Local       static  /*  or as nothing at all */
   
 Each file prototypes functions declared in that file, for example:
   
 Prototype int x;
 Prototype void FuBar(int);
   
 int x;
 /* etc...   */
   
   
 You then create a PROTOS.H file by running MAKEPROTO on all source
 files.  This file should be #include'd by DEFS.H .  MAKEPROTO simply
 extracts all lines beginning with 'Prototype' into the specified
 output file.
   
 <i>dsearch &quot;string&quot; &#060;wildcard&#062;</i>
   
 Searches for the specified string in the specified files.  Quite fast.
 Search is case insensitive.
   
 <i>head &#060;wildcard&#062;</i>
   
 Prints the first 10 lines of each specified file.
   
 <i>wc &#060;wildcard&#062;</i>
   
 counts characters, words, and lines in each specified file and
 prints a total at the very end.
   
 <i>dupdate &#060;files and options&#062;</i>
   
 used to create distributions, in general copies some source tree
 to some destination tree, but only necessary files to bring the
 destination up to par.  Has other features.
   
 <i>autorefs outfile &#060;wildcard&#062;</i>
   
 Used to generate DME.REFS files from .H files, AUTODOC files, and
 other manual pages.
   
 'outfile' is always appended to so if you are re-generating a
 refs file you should first delete it.  files in &#060;wildcard&#062; are
 scanned, with .H recognized as header files and others as
 document files.
   
 <i>du path</i>
   
 DU stands for DISK-USAGE, and reports the aproximate number of
 blocks in a directory tree.  It tries to figure out the number
 of blocks files actually take up by adding a fudge factor for
 side sectors, and it's pretty close, but not perfect.
   
 <i>dprof proffile</i>
   
 DPROF is a program profiler.  When you compile a program with the
 -prof option it will generate a binary data file on exit. The DPROF
 program interprets this .dprof file and displays the profile in
 formatted text.
