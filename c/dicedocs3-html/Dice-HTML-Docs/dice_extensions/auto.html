                            <b>AUTO LIBRARY OPENNING</b>

 Most Amiga libraries are supported on an autoinit basis.  Normally you
 declare the library base variable then OpenLibrary() it in your main.

 If you EXTERN the library base variable instead or simply not declare
 it at all then it will be brought in from auto*.lib along with autoinit
 code to automatically OpenLibrary() it on startup and CloseLibrary() it
 on shutdown.
   
 DICE uses this feature to automatically open floating point libraries,
 dos.library, etc...  For example, with DICE you can write a program
 which simply calls intuition's OpenWindow() function without having
 to OpenLibrary/CloseLibrary &quot;intuition.library&quot;.
   
 Others will be added in the future, eventually to all the libraries.
   
 Note that the auto-open features is fully upward compatible to earlier
 methods of declaring the base pointer and openning the libraries
 manually.  Declaring a library base variable causes the associated
 autolib routines to NOT be linked into the executable.
