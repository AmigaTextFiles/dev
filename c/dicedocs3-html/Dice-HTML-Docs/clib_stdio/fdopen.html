 fdopen

 NAME
  fdopen - associate a file pointer with an already open file descriptor

 SYNOPSIS
  #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;

  FILE *fp = fdopen(fd, modes);
  int fd;
  char *modes;

 FUNCTION
  fdopen associates an already open file descriptor with a file
  pointer.  Note that fclose()ing the file pointer will also
  close() the file descriptor.

  Refer to the fopen manual page for a description of available
  modes.  Note that when you use fdopen the file will not be
  truncated and if you specify mode 'a' for append, the file
  descriptor MUST have been open()'d with the O_APPEND flag.

  That is, the mode string should be similar to the open flags
  that were used to open the file descriptor.

 NOTE
  refer to the file_pointer manual page for general information

 INPUTS
  int fd;     file descriptor to associated with a new file pointer
  char *modes;    modes string, such as &quot;r+&quot;.

 RESULTS
  FILE *fp;   new file pointer or NULL if an error occured

 SEE ALSO
  fopen, fread, fwrite, fgets, fputs
