 fclose                        

 NAME
  fclose - close a file pointer

 SYNOPSIS
  #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;

  int error = fclose(fp);
  FILE *fp;

 FUNCTION
  fclose flushes any data remaining in the file pointer's
  output buffer to the file and then closes the file.  The
  file pointer is no longer valid.

  fclose returns any error condition that occured while flushing
  the buffered data to the file.  The file is still closed even
  if an error occurs.

 NOTE
  You can fclose(stdin), fclose(stdout), and fclose(stderr) as
  you wish to save space and/or detach your process from the
  console (i.e. allow the console window to be closed).

 WARNING
  If you fclose stdin, stdout, and stderr with the intension of
  removing all references to the console window there is still
  one more thing you have to do, and that is put a NULL in
  your processes pr_ConsoleTask field.  Otherwise, while the
  console window will be able to close, your process will still
  have a reference to the now non existant window if it attempts
  to spawn or Execute() other processes.

  refer to the file_pointer manual page for general information

 INPUTS
  FILE *fp;   file pointer

 RESULTS
  int error;  error on fclose, or 0 if none

 SEE ALSO
  fopen, fread, fwrite, fgets, fputs
