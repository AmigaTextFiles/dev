 fopen

 NAME
  fopen - open a file and create a file pointer for it

 SYNOPSIS
  #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;

  FILE *fp = fopen(filename, modes)
  char *filename;
  char *modes;

 FUNCTION
  fopen is the grand master of stdio; It opens and possibly creates a
  file and returns a new file pointer for use by the program.

  The first argument is the file to open, the second is a string
  containing one or mode characters defined as follows:

  r   open for reading, the file must already exist

  w   open for writing, the file is created if it does not exist,
      truncated if it does

  a   open for append, writes always append to the file.  If 'a' is
      ever specified, the file starts out positioned at the end
      instead of at the beginning.  This mode also creates the
      file but only if it does not already exist.

  +   along with 'r' this also allows writing to the file
      along with 'w' this also allows reading from the file

  b   open for binary read/write, else the file is assumed to contain
      text (this is ignored by DICE since there is no difference on
      the Amiga).

  All combinations except &quot;rw&quot; are allowed.  One uses &quot;r+&quot; or &quot;w+&quot;
  instead of &quot;rw&quot;.  By the above description &quot;r+&quot; is used to update
  an existing file while &quot;w+&quot; is used to create a new file and then
  allow reads as well as writes to it.

  &quot;wa&quot; is equivalent to creating a new file and then appending to
  it.  &quot;r+a&quot; is equivalent to appending to an already existing
  file.

  Other examples of valid modes combinations: &quot;r+b&quot;, &quot;w+b&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;,
  &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;r+&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, etc...

 NOTE
  refer to the file_pointer manual page for general information

 EXAMPLE
  /*
   *  create a new file and write some text to it
   */

  #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
  #include &#060;assert.h&#062;

  main()
  {
      FILE *fp = fopen(&quot;T:xx&quot;, &quot;w&quot;);
      char buf[256];

      assert(fp);

      puts(&quot;Enter a line&quot;);
      if (fgets(buf, sizeof(buf), stdin)) {
      fputs(buf, fp);
      puts(&quot;The line has been written to T:xx&quot;);
      }
      fclose(fp);

      return(0);
  }

 INPUTS
  char *filename;     file name to open
  char *modes;        open modes string

 RESULTS
  FILE *fp;       new file pointer
