 fputs
 puts

 NAME
  fputs - write a string to a file pointer
  puts  - write a string to stdout and also write a newline

 SYNOPSIS
  #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;

  int error = fputs(s, fp);
  int error = puts(s);

  const char *s;
  FILE *fp;

 FUNCTION
  fputs writes a string to a file pointer all the way up to, but not
  including, the nul.  puts does the same thing but to stdout, and
  puts additionally writes a newline out.

 NOTE
  refer to the file_pointer manual page for general information

  It is common to get confused between fputs and puts.  Remember that
  puts adds a newline to the output while fputs does not.  gets strips
  the newline from an input line while fgets does not.

 EXAMPLE

  #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;

  main()
  {
      fputs(&quot;This is a test of fputsn&quot;, stdout); /* note newline    */
      puts(&quot;This is a test of puts&quot;);             /*  note lack of   */
      puts(&quot;That's it!&quot;);
      return(0);
  }

 INPUTS
  char *s;    string to write
  FILE *fp;   file pointer

 RESULTS
  int error;  0 or positive if all went ok, else negative.  Note
          that unlike *printf() routines the number of chars
          written out is NOT returned.
