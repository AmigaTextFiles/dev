 FUNCTION
 DICE will automatically open libraries for you (DICE)

 DESCRIPTION
 With DICE you need not worry about opening or closing Amiga
 libraries.  You don't have to deal with the mess and hassle of
 checking error returns from each open.  If a function call to a
 library is used, the library base variable will be referenced.  If
 you did not explicitly define the variable, DICE will insert it,
 along with code to open and close the library.

 For example, if the _IntuitionBase base variable is referenced (say,
 with extern) but not declared then _IntuitionBase will be
 automatically declared in auto.lib.  Additionally, auto.lib adds
 routines to the autoinit and autoexit sequences that automatically
 open &quot;intuition.library&quot; before _main and close it after _exit. If
 the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is ever
 called. The autoexit routine that closes the library first checks to
 see if the base variable is NULL and skips trying to close the
 library if so.

 EXAMPLE
 /*
 **  Example program which just calls an
 **  intuition.library function without
 **  bothering to open the library.
 */
 main()
 {
    DisplayBeep( 0 );
 }
