                             <b>About DICE</b>


DICE is a complete C Language development system written for and on
the Commodore Amiga computer.  DICE includes a compiler, editor,
linker, source code management tools, help system, debugger, and
examples  in short, everything you need to write programs which take
full advantage of everything the Amiga has to offer.

DICE was designed from the start with the international ANSI C
standard in mind, as well as compatibility with other Amiga C
Compiler products on the market.  In addition, DICE provides a number
of extensions targeted at providing you with easy access to the
Amiga's special features.

DICE contains no security or copy-protection &quot;features&quot; to get in
your way.  As such, an illegal copy could be yours for little or no
work.  We'd rather you not take advantage of this, however. We want
to update, support and expand the DICE system; for that we need
sales.
