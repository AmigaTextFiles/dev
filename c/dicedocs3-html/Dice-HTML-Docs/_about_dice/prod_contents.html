                              <b>Product Contents</b>

DICE comes complete with:

Project Manager --- Note yet mate ---
The Project Manager allows you to control all the tools that are
part of the DICE suite.

Compiler
This is the heart of the DICE product.  It includes DC1, DCPP, DAS,
and DCC.  Together, these control the complete stages of compiling
and linking both C and assembler source code.  DCPP may also be used
as a standalone preprocessing tool.  The compiler supports in-line
calls to all Amiga Library functions through standard #pragma
statements, registerized parameters, profiling code,
auto-initialization code, and pure code to make programs resident.

When combined with the Editor, Visual Options, and Integrated Help,
the Compiler will allow for interactive development and error
corrections.

Debugger
No C compiler product is complete without a source level debugger.
As a windowing debugger, DEBUG gives you the ability to examine the
execution of your code, set break points, watch memory, and even
modify the execution.  Fully integrated with the Amiga, it supports
AREXX, cut and paste, mouse clicks, and all Amiga screen modes.

Linker
Compatible with standard Amiga Object files, DLINK is a fast linker.
It allows control of data placement and will combine code to provide
the powerful auto-initialization capabilities of DICE.

Profiler
Once you have a program running, DPROF gives you the ability to
identify hot spots in the code to allow you to improve algorithms or
even recode critical portions of the code.  You can control the level
of code that you wish to profile through a series of compiler and
linker options.

Assembler
DICE includes two assemblers.  DAS is a low overhead assembler which
is used by the compiler because of its speed.  When you wish to do
advanced Amiga programming, you may also use A68k which includes
powerful macros and complete integration with C calling conventions.

Online Help
In order to speed the development process, DiceHelp allows immediate
access to all DICE and Amiga subroutines with just a single
keystroke.  In addition, a C language reference and all error
messages are immediately accessible.  DiceHelp works with your
favorite editor.

VMake and VOpts
In order to speed development, DICE includes a set of visual
development tools that allow you to quickly edit, compile, link, and
debug your project without having to resort to the CLI or continually
type commands to invoke the compiler.  VMake eliminates the tedium of
maintaining a Makefile by letting you just enter the files for the
project and tell it the type of project to build.  It even will read
and write Makefiles so that you can resort to the CLI if you feel
more comfortable.

Within VMake, you can edit files by just double clicking on them. If
they happened to be stored in RCS, VMake will automatically check
them out.  Checking them back into an archive is as simple as
selecting a menu item.  You may also invoke the debugger on your
application, and test it out without having to exit the VMake
environment.

Of course, it is not complete without the ability to visually set the
compiler options that your project demands.  VOpts talks directly to
VMake to manage the options for compiling your project.

Development Tools
Because writing a program on the Amiga requires more than just a
compiler and a linker, DICE provides a wide range of tools for
manipulating the environment. This includes text tools like Cat,
Dsearch, Head, Touch, WC, and IStrip.

There are also tools for manipulating object files and libraries such
as DObj, FDToLib, FDToPragma, LbMake, and LibToS. MakeProto will
automatically collect prototypes into a common header file. DiceCache
allows control over caching of files to speed up the development
environment. Lastly, for dealing with groups of files we have Du,
DUpdate, and LHarc.

Make Utility
While not identical to the standard Unixtm make utility, DMake offers
the power to control putting together a project without having to
retype commands each time.  With a built-in macro facility and rule
based decision engine, DMake will only recompile those pieces of a
project that have changed. DMake files are easy to create, consistent
and powerful.

Editor
Because not everyone has an editor that they may be happy with, DME
is provided to permit easy editing of source code and other text
files.  It includes complete Amiga integration with menus, AREXX,
mouse support, programmable keys, and multiple-window support.  Use
of DME is not required; DICE will integrate easily with virtually any
Amiga editor

File Compression
DICE includes a powerful compression handler that automatically
compresses or uncompresses files as they are transferred from disk.
This feature is especially useful for floppy users.  Any mix of
compressed and regular files may exist on the same volume.  Normally
the Commodore &quot;include&quot; files, required for Amiga programming, take
up an entire floppy.  With the compression handler they use half
that.  As an owner of DICE, you may use this compression utility for
all your needs.

Source Code Management Tools
The RCS source code management tools can help you maintain a revision
history for your code.  Ci, Co, and RCS allow checking files in and
out of a library as well as managing multiple versions of the code.
RCSDiff will compare two files in the library to identify changes.
RLog will display history of file modifications while RCSMerge will
allow merging changes from two distinct lines of development.  We
highly recommend using the RCS tools for all of your development
efforts.

Romable Code Generation Tools
In addition to generating Amiga executables, DICE allows generation
of code for any 68000 based platform.  Romable and BinToHex combined
with a number of DCC options allow generation of romable code and
standard Motorola S records.

Workbench Support Tools
For those people who wish to work from Workbench instead of the CLI,
DICE includes VOpts for setting compiler options visually, and Vmake
for controlling a project build visually.  Although they work with
Workbench, the CLI user may also use them to manage a project
interactively.

Include Files
Because people wish to develop source code that works under all
versions of the Amiga Operating System, DICE includes several sets of
header files. You can choose which of these includes to reference
based on an environment variable or compiler option.

Libraries
This is one area where DICE really shines.  Included are libraries
which provide ANSI, Unixtm, and general Amiga compatibility.  These
libraries are provided in a number of models allowing for linking
with just about any normal program. However there are cases where
something fancy needs to be done, or a special combination of library
switches is used for which a library hasn't been supplied. For this,
we also provide the complete source code to the libraries along with
the configuration scripts to build them.

Source Code
DICE also comes with example source code to show you how to program
on the Amiga.

VOPTS
The Vopts utility shipped with DICE allows customizing of the
compiler environment.  It illustrates everything necessary for
programming gadgets, menus, keyboard input, file i/o, and even
internationalization on the Amiga.  It also illustrates how to write
a program which takes advantage of both 1.3 and 2.0 capabilities.
One special bonus with this example is the ability to allow the user
to customize the gadget presentation of the program without having to
change the source code.  In this case, the program read the gadgets
from a file and dynamically lays them out based on the screen
resolution, current font, and color choices.

Shared_Lib
One of the key components of the Amiga, libraries are the method of
adding dynamic linked routines to the system.  This example includes
everything necessary to build a library, add it to the system and to
provide some simple services.  This particular library allows saving
and retrieving a simple string. It also shows how to write a program
using the newly created library.

Printer_Driver
A sample printer driver that compiles and runs.  This includes
support for graphics, font selection, and extended attributes.  It
can be readily modified for a printer that you might not have a
printer driver for.

Exec_Dev
An example Exec device which emulates a disk level device as a single
file on a hard disk.  This shows how to handle the basic
init/termination and read/write functions. As a tool, it is extremely
useful for emulating a second (or multiple) floppy disk on a system
with a hard disk.

DosHan
This is a simple AmigaDOS handler which supports basic
open/close/read/write packets. It can be used as the basis for a more
complex handler.  It also includes instructions for adding the
handler to the system.

DCC
This is the complete source for the DCC front end to the compiler.

cat/count/wc
These simple programs illustrate basic C programming with command
line arguments and simple output.  They parallel examples found in
many C programming books.

hello.c
Of course, no compiler product would be complete without the
definitive source code to the standard Hello world program.
