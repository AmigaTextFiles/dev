Introduction to <b>DICE 3.16</b>

- 1) DICE is back in development by <b>Richard Drummond</b>, of CU Amiga
     Fame (well almost) as well as anybody else who wants to contribute.
     It was only posted on 02/10/98 so don't expect a IDE yet.
     Mail him at....
     
     <b><a href="mailto:dice@drummond.u-net.com">dice@drummond.u-net.com</a></b> and the DICE mailing list at
     <b>onelist.com/archives.cgi/dice</b> free subscription .....!!
     
- 2) Yes it was compiled from the Free DICE 3.15 source, (yes I tried it
     as well, takes ages however) get if from aminet, dev/c/dice-3.15.lha
     and spend hours fiddling to try and get it to work.
     
- 3) Matt Dillion <b>Fully</b> supports new DICE versions and is in the 
     process off setting up a CVS deposit for any new source code. (cool)

- 4) Yes, those are the fd files and No, its OK, they were (apparently)
     released just before they lost it last time.

- 5) What's this AmigaGuide? err, its going to be part of the new
     documentation set. I also plan a RTF version (this will come before
     any major new amigaguide versions). I will test it on ww6, Word6/97
     (PC/MAC), (sorry but lets face it - where are people going to print all
     this stuff out? yep at college, university or at work, so unless you
     are very lucky is go to work with Word) also it is much easier to use
     as a reference in paper form, well I think so...., some more help is
     needed however..

- 6) Who the hell are you!!, err sorry Matthew Fletcher, mjf or mfletche on
     chat areas. I am doing software engineering but prefer to play around
     all day with masses of text files. Mail me at...
     
     <b><a href="mailto:Matthew.Fletcher@student.shu.ac.uk">Matthew.Fletcher@student.shu.ac.uk</a></b> or over the summer 
     <b><a href="mailto:amimjf@Hotmail.com">amimjf@Hotmail.com</a></b> just don't expect quick replies.....!!
