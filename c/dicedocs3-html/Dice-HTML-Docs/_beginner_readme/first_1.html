                       <b>FIRST PROGRAM FROM START TO END</b>

After installing DICE, reboot your system.  If you run from Workbench,
you must open a CLI or Shell window to fool around with DICE.

NOTE:   From Workbench, the path might not be properly set up.  If you:

    1&#062; DCC

and it comes back command not found, and DCC *does* exist on the floppy
or in-memory, then the path may not be properly set up.


<i>(1)</i> Creating the source code.  CD into some scratch directory... I use
T: here.

    1&#062; CD T:

<i>(2)</i> Edit a new file.  You do not have to RUN the editor, but it is always
nice because you can run the compiler without exiting the editor. This
tutorial expects you to RUN the editor:

    1&#062; RUN DME test.c

<i>(3)</i> DME brings up an editor window on the workbench.  Pressing the
right mouse button should bring up a menu (assuming you are not already 
familiar with DME and installed it from the DICE disks). IF DME DOES NOT 
HAVE A MENU, then the right mouse button will probably iconify the window
instead.  This means you forgot to copy DCC:S/.EDRC into S: ... again, this
file already exists if you simply booted with a copy of the distribution 
disk so you should see a menu.

Um, that was just to make sure DME is configured right... you can let go of
the RMB (right mouse button) now.  If you flip through the menu items 
available, you will note that many options have keyboard equivalents.
For further information on mapping keys to your own macros, read the
DCC2:MAN/DME.DOC document.  You can read the document by putting the DCC2: 
floppy into DF0: and selecting the Project/Open-NewWin menu option 
(this brings up a new window so you now have two, though the first one is 
covered.  To use the same window use the Project/Open-Replace menu option).

Type in your program. The cursor keys may be used to move the cursor around.
control-cursor_key skips multiple lines while shift-cursor_key skips to the
top or bottom of the file. Typing RETURN on the last line adds a new line 
to the file. Typing RETURN in general inserts a new line after the current
line.

BASIC DME KEY COMMANDS, REFER TO DCC2:MAN/DME.DOC FOR MORE INFORMATION.  
These comprise only a few of the many commands available. You can construct
your own key macros and menu options to your whim as you get better.

    <i>&#060;cursor-key&#062;</i>        move the cursor around.

    <i>ctl-&#060;cursor-key&#062;</i>    skip around

    <i>shift-&#060;cursor-key&#062;</i>  move to top of text, bottom of text, first
                        column, or end-of-line

    <i>&#060;del&#062;</i>   delete a character. Experiment with &#060;del&#062; and &#060;backspace&#062;
            to determine the differences between the two.

    <i>shift-&#060;del&#062;</i>     delete a LINE

    <i>ctl-i</i>           control-i, go into insert mode
    <i>ctl-o</i>           control-o, go into overwrite mode

    <i>alt-i</i>           ICONIFY WINDOW.  Window becomes iconified (very,
                very small)... un-clutters the workbench screen.
                You may un-iconify by selecting the iconified
                window and hitting the right mouse button.

    <i>help</i>            brings up a new window (as in &#060;f3&#062;) with
                DCC2:MAN/DME.DOC in it.


                FILE LOAD, SAVE
        All of these have equivalent Menu options

    <i>&#060;f1&#062;</i>            Insert a file.  The current filename and file
                in the window stays, but some other file is
                inserted into the current text... experiment
                with this with a few small text files.

    <i>&#060;f2&#062;</i>            Edit a new file... replaces the current window
                with a new file.  The old file is gone (not
                deleted, just not being edited any more).  If
                you made modifications to the current file a
                requester will pop up asking you if you want
                to really throw it away.

    <i>&#060;f3&#062;</i>            Edit a new file... opens up a new window for the
                new file after you type in the file name, the
                previous file window is still there though
                probably obscured... you can move and resize
                the windows however you wish.

    <i>&#060;f9&#062;</i>            save file

    <i>&#060;f10&#062;</i>           save file and close window (exits DME if this is
                the last window)

    <i>c-q</i>         Quit - same as the close window gadget.


<i>(4) PROGRAM?  What Program?</i>  This program:

    -------- top of file (this line not part of file) --------

    #include &#060;stdio.h&#062;
    #include &#060;stdlib.h&#062;

    main()
    {
        puts(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
        return(0);
    }

    -------- bottom of file (this line not part of file) -----


<i>(5) COMPILING THE PROGRAM</i>
Write out the file with F9

You can either quit out of the editor or simply bring your CLI window 
forward to compile the program.  Better, iconify the editor window to 
un-clutter your workbench screen!  To compile the program, enter this line:

    1&#062; dcc test.c -o test

This tells DICE to compile and link test.c into an executable. DICE should 
grind on the file and then return another CLI prompt. If any requester comes
up, you are missing an assignment or two:

    DINCLUDE:   you are missing the DINCLUDE: assignment which
            should be set to DCC:INCLUDE.

    DLIB:       you are missing the DLIB: assignment which should
            be set to DCC:DLIB.

    &quot;Unable to open dlib:Amigas13.lib or dlib:dlib:amigas13.lib&quot;

Means that you do not have amigas.lib installed in DLIB: ... Amigas13.LIB 
is Amiga.LIB after being put through the LIBTOS program and comes with the 
registered version of DICE.

Double check that you have 'SETENV DCCOPTS -1.3' and that DLIB: is assigned
and amigas13.lib is in it, as well as other DICE libraries.

<i>(6) RUN THE PROGRAM</i>

    1&#062; test
    Hello World!
    1&#062;

You can make the program so it can be made resident by compiling with the
-r option. A -r compiled program's executable will have the PURE bit set
automatically and may optionally be made resident.  Programs not compiled
with the -r option will not have the Pure bit set and may not be made
resident.

    1&#062; dcc test.c -o test -r
    1&#062; test
    Hello World!
    1&#062; resident test
    1&#062; test
    Hello World!                <i>&#060;- much faster response!</i>


<i>(7) **** WARNING **** ABOUT RESIDENTED EXECUTABLES</i>
It is a COMMON mistake when a programmer is making modifications and 
recompiling a program to forget to REMOVE the program from the resident 
list if it was placed on it.  I.E........

    1&#062; resident test REMOVE

The reason is simple... you make a change and recompile your program.  But,
you have already been the program resident. If you run the program the 'old'
version will be run.  Thus, you want to either remove it from the resident 
list or re-resident the executable.

You can also force a program to be loaded from disk by providing a full path
to it. I.E...........

    1&#062; resident test
    1&#062; test
    Hello World!       <i>&#060;- uses resident version</i>

    1&#062; DF0:test        <i>(or wherever you compiled test to)</i>
    Hello World!       <i> &#060;- uses disk version</i></i>


<i>(8) PROGRAM EXAMPLES</i>
The registered DICE distribution comes with a large number of program
examples that should prove invaluable to a beginner.  Additionally, every 
manual page includes a self-contained program example for the particular 
function the page describes and this also should prove invaluable when 
confusion arises.

Please refer to the README for an overview, and also browse the DICE disks 
from a CLI.  Unfortunately, due to space packing, I sometimes move things
around and forget to update the documentation.  The DME example is the best
of the lot and is on DCC3:
Read the README file on DCC3 for unpacking instructions.

To run a DMakefile type the DMAKE command on the directory containing the 
DMakefile.  I'm afraid the DMake is a huge hack and not much good 
documentation is available for it, but what documentation there is is in 
DCC3:MAN/DMAKE.DOC

<i>(9)</i>
That terminates the tutorial.  Refer to the DCC:DOC and DCC2:MAN directories
for documents describing other executables (use DME to bring these files up
and browse through them).  Note that the top few lines of each file contain
a keyword that gives DME it's quick-reference capability to the file.
