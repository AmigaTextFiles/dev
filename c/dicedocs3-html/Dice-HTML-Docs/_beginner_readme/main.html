 There are more tutorials and some source code included in the dedicated
 tutorial section, these two simple programs should have got you into the
 basics. These will teach you some of the rest.

 Obviously, it is impossible for me or anybody else (despite Matts valiant
 efforts) to teach anyone who is new to C how to code - you would be advised
 to get hold of some books. Mastering Amiga C, by Paul Overaa, for example is
 by no means current but it is available in most libraries and ALL libraries
 should be able to get hold of a copy for you (a small fee is usually
 required). Another good source are magazine tutorials, as I write this
 (22/10/1998) Amiga Format is currently running one and the sadly defunct
 CU Amiga had finished a vast exercise in Amiga programming. Both of these
 are well worth checking out, in addition of a good reference book (ANSI
 remember..., as the WinTel books will teach you nothing important). MJF.
