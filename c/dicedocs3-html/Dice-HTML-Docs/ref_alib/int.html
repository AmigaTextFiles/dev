 NAME
 _IntuitionBase auto-open

 SYNOPSIS

 FUNCTION
 If the _IntuitionBase base variable is referenced (i.e. extern) but
 not declared then _IntuitionBase will be automatically declared in
 the intlib module of auto.lib. Additionally, auto.lib adds routines
 to the autoinit and autoexit sequences called by c.a that
 automatically opens &quot;intuition.library&quot; before _main and
 closes it after _exit.

 If the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is
 ever called.

 The autoexit routine that closes the library first checks to see if
 the base variable is NULL and skips trying to close the library if
 so.

 NOTE
 Programs that use this auto-open feature by simply calling graphics
 library functions without bothering to declare or open the library
 will only compile under DICE.  When compiled with other compilers a
 link error will occur since the linker will not be able to find any
 declared storage for the base variable, only references.

 EXAMPLE
 /*
  *  Example program which just calls an intuition.library function
  *  without bothering to open the library.
  */

 main()
 {
     LockIBase();
     UnlockIBase();
 }
