- This guide was written with v39/40 amigaguide lib and datatype in mind,
it will probably work with v37, but I have no way of testing it, any
reports of problems, (although I have tried to be careful) would be
helpful thanks.

- Its all messy! The text does not even fit into the window properly? err
this is your fault, it does on my computer. I used polarsmall.font, I cant
possibly get it to fit with all font sizes on all screen resolutions (the
RTF version is for this). Anyway, why are you using a screen font that does
not allow you to fit a standard width 75 columns line onto your screen at 
once? wordwrap is set to 76. This seemed the best option. If you have small
problems change this, if you have big problems use the RTF version...!!
