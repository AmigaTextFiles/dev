*                      REQUIREMENTS-INSTALLATION                         *
**************************************************************************

1) KickStart Release 2.0 or Higher. (A500+ ,A600 ,A1200, ....)
2) 2MB ram.
3) or 1MB ram.(This is the absolute minimum and will limit what you can do)

note: Two disk drives or a hard drive are required for any serious work, but
      for anyone just wanting to try HCE, a single drive is ok.

Installing HCE:
---------------
To use HCE from the (HCE:) disk it comes on, do the following:

   1) Load Workbench
   2) Place the HCE disk into the Internal drive.
   3) Click on its Icon.
   4) Then click on either the HCE_1MB Icon or the HCE_2MB Icon, 
      (don't click the 2MB Icon if your machine only has 1MB!).
   5) If you have 2 disk drives, place the workbench disk into the external
      drive and the HCE disk into the internal drive.

To Install HCE to other disks, See the 'Hce.doc' (on the docs and examples
 disk) for details.

HCE was developed on an A1200 with two external disk drives, and has not 
been fully tested on any other Amiga.
If HCE fails to load on your machine, please write to me explaining
the reason why. I will try and fix the problem ready for the next release
of HCE.

On requiring information from commodore as to how much and where to 
obtain the Include files the reply was:

To obtain the 1.3 Native Developers disk may I suggest you contact
Sharon Rodrigo at our Maidenhead Office (0628) 770088,
or send a cheque to the amount of £25 to:-

       Commodore Business Machines UK Ltd
       Commodore House
       The Switchback

the Amiga specific Libraries, Autodocs and much more.

note: this letter was received over a year ago, and the price of
      the developer disk could have changed.
      If you decide to obtain the Amiga Include files now, you 
      should ask for Includes which cover Kickstart release 2.04,or Higher.

If you do not live in the UK then you should try and contact your
National Commodore office.

***************************************************************************
*            What is HCE and why would you want to use it?                *
***************************************************************************

What is HCE?
-------------
HCE first started out as a stand alone text editor for programmers
which was capable of compiling C source codes from within the editor.
This was done by running a PD compiler such as the ZC compiler from the
editor and passing the source code filename. But this had its down sides
such as all error messages would go to the CLI, you had to save the source
code before you could compile it, the compiler did not check memory as
it compiled and would on occasions crash, not very pleasant!.
Then I came across the HCC compiler by Detlef Wuerkner from fish disk 508, 
which came with source and could compile itself!. 
I decided to modify the Compiler and the Editor source codes so as to be
able to combine the two and make a single program, 'HCE'.
It started off with many bugs but eliminated the bad memory management and 
other side effects. 
The program to date is pretty much bug free and has many features some
of which I have mentioned below.

Why use HCE?
------------
 some good points:
                    1) You can modify and test your code without leaving
                       the editor.
                    2) You can mark out and test sections of code.
                    3) You can run your finished program from the editor.
                    3) If an error is encounted the editor will scroll
                       to the area of the offending line automatically.
                    4) You can compile or assemble upto 55 files at a
                       time using Compile Lists. 
                       These are files which end with a '.CL' extension.
                    6) You can also link upto 55 files at a time 
                       using Link Lists.
                       These are files which end with a '.LL' extension.
                    5) It shows what files and how much memory your
                       using during compile.
                    6) Does memory checking and aborts if Low.
                    7) You can make libraries from either FD files, Object
                       files or both.
                    8) The Compiler,Optimizer,Assembler and Linker have
                       their own option screens which use simple 
                       (GadTools) gadgets.
                    9) Can do common file operations such as Rename,
                       Relabel,Assign,MakeDir,Delete,Copy.
                   10) Supports most of the common text editor features,
                       such as Cut,Copy,Insert,Print Block,Find,Replace,
                       goto, and more.
                   11) Allows full screen editing by pressing the escape
                       key.
                   12) Has own preferences screen. You can change and save
                       the pen,paper,markout colour,Compiler/Optimizer/
                       Assembler and Linker options and most other areas 
                       of the program.
                   13) Can compile itself.
                   14) Complete source code is provided.
                   15) And most Importantly, It`s Free!.

 some bad points:
                    1) You cannot type beyond the visable windows width.
                    2) There is a maximum file size of 1998 lines.
                    3) There are no type over modes.
                    4) The editor upon loading swallows around 500K
                       of memory.
                    5) The Source to HCE is not portable. Takes advantage
                       of the Amigas Operating System. (Not really a bad
                       point though).
                    5) The Internal Compiler (HCC) is not an ANSI Compiler.
                    6) Requires Kickstart release 2.00 or Higher.

***************************************************************************
*           WRITING COMMERCIAL OR SHAREWARE PROGRAMS WITH HCE             *
***************************************************************************

This distribution does not make use of the CClib.library by Robert 
W. Albrecht Jr, which requires a $50 licence fee for Commercial or 
Shareware programs which use it. The HCC compiler from Fish disk 508
did use it. So if you are a user of HCC and have now decided to use HCE
you can either use the libraries I have provided or to replace them with 
CClib.library.
The libraries I have provided are the original Sozobon C libraries and
have had bug fixes and some enhancements.

Programs written using HCE do not require that you pay any licence fees.

*                            HISTORY                                      *
***************************************************************************

For information on the history of the Sozobon C Compiler, I suggest
you get Fish disk 508. The HCC distribution by Detlef Wuerkner has 
the full history and original Sozobon C documentation.

*                          IMPROVING HCE                                  *
***************************************************************************

If you find any bugs in HCE I would be most gratefull if you could make
a copy of the 'Bug_Report.doc' , fill it in and send it to me. If it
really was a bug then I will fix it and give your name a mention in the 
next release of HCE.
In order for me to make HCE useful, I need your opinions on what you
consider to be missing from HCE, what needs improving and what things
in general you would like to see in HCE. All opinions gratefully accepted.

You could of course improve HCE yourself and send it directly to Fred Fish.
I do not recomend this, it would be better to have a single version of
HCE in the Public Domain rather than 20 or so with minor bug fixes.
If you send the bugs to me I will fix them and give your name a mention
in the next release of HCE.

note: If you write to me requiring a reply, you are more likely to get it
      if you enclose an S.S.A.E.

Have fun with HCE!
