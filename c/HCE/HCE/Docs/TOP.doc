Note from Jason Petty:
   Ignore the comment related to CClib.lib, as TOP has been recompiled
   and then linked with Dale Schumacher's libraries (see LIB.doc).

top Version 2.00  Copyright (c) 1988-1991 by Sozobon, Limited.
    Amiga Version 1.1 by Detlef Wuerkner.

Usage: top [flags] infile [outfile]

Valid optimizer flags are:
   -d: Debug
   -v: Verbose
   -b: Branch reversal OFF
   -l: Loop rotation OFF
   -p: Peephole optimization OFF
   -r: Variable registerizing OFF
   -g: No change of stack fix-ups (for debugging)
   -c: Force DATA and BSS hunks to Chip Memory

If no outputfile is specified, top will, by default, overwrite the inputfile.

The optimizer needs CClib.library to be found in 'libs:'

Temporary files are written to T: Be sure to 'Assign T: xxx' before running
the optimizer the first time.

Caution: The file names of the temporary files are hard-coded in the program,
so NEVER RUN TOP MORE THAN ONCE AT A TIME!

I can't say how much stack is needed by the optimizer. With my standard
setting of Stack 10000, it seemed to work ok.

The optimizer converts the output of HCC to Motorola format. The output is
as follows:
List of XREF's,   if any
List of XDEF's,   if any  (No double names in XREF's and XDEF's. Also no
                           XDEF's for 'static' functions and data.)
CODE,             if any
DATA or CHIPDATA, if any
BSS  or CHIPBSS,  if any
END

The optimizer sometimes takes 'a significant amount of time' when optimizing
long functions, e.g. those in peep2.c and peep3.c of it's own source code.
You could split long functions in multiple shorter, or you could use some
of the -blpr flags if you are in a hurry.
