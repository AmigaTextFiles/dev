FD2Stubs - create interface stubs from .fd-files

Usage: FD2Stubs libraryname (_lib.fd will be added)

DON'T specify a path name, CD to the .fd-directory!
The program creates many files 'T:librarynameNNN',
one file for each library function, and a script file
'T:Makelibraryname' which will, if called via Execute,
generate the file 'T:libraryname.stubs'. You can 'Join'
that file together with those generated from other .fd-files
to the finally file 'stubs.lib'. Assign T: to RAM:T,
copy A68k, Join, Rename and Delete to RAM: and type
'path RAM: add' before running the produced scriptfile.

The program needs CClib.library V3.0 to be found in 'libs:'.

For easier use, you should write a batch file. See for example
'HCC:s/MakeStubsLib'.

Something about amiga.lib:
--------------------------
The program creates shorter stubs than that in amiga.lib, since d0,d1,a0,a1,
D2 and A6 are NOT saved. Therefore, I can't say if the stubs would work
with Aztec or Lattice. If possible, 'JMP' instead of 'JSR' is used.
If you have the original Commodore 1.3 amiga.lib:
CreateTask(), fgetc() and getchar() of amiga.lib use A6 as local stack pointer
(link, unlk). If you want to use this routines: Do NOT mix them with stub code
from FD2Stubs, since the stub codes would destroy A6. All other routines should
work even when mixed (except fpbcd(), this never worked).
The source code for CreateTask() can be found in the Addison-Wesley
'Includes and Autodocs' manual.
