 CFLOW.C - A C Function Call Chart Generator
 
  Version 1.00         December 21st, 1986
 
  SYNOPSIS:
 
  CFLOW accepts C source code via the standard input and
  produces a listing of the hierarchy of C function calls
  on the standard output. Recursive functions are explicitly
  identified in the listing. The command line format is:
 
       CFLOW <source_file
 
  The output listing identifies all functions in the source
  code and the functions they call (#include files are not
  recognized). If only specific functions are of interest,
  (e.g. - fcn1, fcn2, fcn3), a listing for these functions
  only and the functions they call can be specified with the
  command line:
 
       CFLOW <source_file fcn1 fcn2 fcn3

 Now checks if called from CLI or if invalid file, shows usage then exits
 with an error status. Does not use 'stdin' for input but instead
 requires user to specify a filename on the command line.

 To clear things up a bit here's the Usage:

             CFLOW <source_filename> <function name 1> <funcn2> <funcn3>

 If called:  CFLOW <source_filename>
 without function name then the default is to list 'main()'.
