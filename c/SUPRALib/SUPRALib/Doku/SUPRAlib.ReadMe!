SUPRAlib
--------

This is a port of SUPRAlib to vbcc.

All sourcefiles begin with big autodoc-headers, look there for
informations (inclusive my patches).

The 4 testprograms (found in this archive) working correct. I'm
only unshure with the gfx-functions. Please be carefully with
them, I fixed all problems I found but I'm not use them for myself.

Directory source.org is the original, source is my patched version.

My comments to 'vbcc ....' means the versions 0.6a upto 0.6e and must
not be correct at actual 0.7.

But, I was ready bevor 0.7 comes out...
