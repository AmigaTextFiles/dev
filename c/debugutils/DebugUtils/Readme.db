**************************** IMPORTANT NOTE: *******************************
*																									*
*	Before trying to recompile the SAStrace.lib, please read the COMMENTS	*
*	section in trace.c.  I have removed some code from trace.c that will		*
*	not allow this code to be compiled using current SAS libraries.			*

****************************************************************************


The Manxtrace.lib has not been tested beyond the test.Manx executable found
in the bin directory.  That program works fine, but more extensive testing
could certainly be done.  I can't think of any reason why it would not work
as well as the SAStrace.lib, but one never knows.

The SAStrace.lib was compiled using the lcmffp.lib as indicated in the
Make.SAS file.  In order to obtain floating point output using the library
you will need to compile with -ff and link with lcmffp.lib.  I didn't bother
with the many other math formats because this is what I am using now.

The makefiles all assume the library with which to link will be named
"trace.lib".  This will necessitate renaming one or the other of the SAS or
Manx versions which have been included.

If the source code and other text files look funny on your editor, try set-
ting tabstops at 3.

The source code has been included in this distribution.  Please feel free to
modify it to suit your needs.  I only ask that you leave all comments and
header information intact.

Thanks, and happy bug-stomping
