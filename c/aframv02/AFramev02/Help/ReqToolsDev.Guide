  NAME  rtAllocRequestA()

    req = rtAllocRequestA (type, taglist);

    APTR rtAllocRequestA (ULONG, struct TagItem *);
    D0                    D0     A0

    req = rtAllocRequest (type, tag1,...);

    APTR rtAllocRequest (ULONG, Tag,...);

  DESCRIPTION
    Allocates a requester structure for you in a future compatible manner.
    This is the only way to properly allocate a rtFileRequester,
    rtFontRequester, rtReqInfo or rtScreenModeRequester structure.  The
    structure will be initialized for you.

    Use rtFreeRequest() to free the requester structure when you no longer
    need it.

  INPUTS
    type    - type of structure to allocate, currently RT_REQINFO,
              RT_FILEREQ, RT_FONTREQ or RT_SCREENMODEREQ.
    taglist - pointer to array of tags (currently always NULL).

  TAGS
    no tags defined yet

  RESULT
    req - pointer to the requester allocated or NULL if no memory.

  BUGS
    none known

  NAME  rtFreeRequest()

    rtFreeRequest (req);

    void rtFreeRequest (APTR);
                        A1

  DESCRIPTION
    Free requester structure previously allocated by rtAllocRequestA().
    This will also free all buffers associated with the requester, so there
    is no need to call rtFreeReqBuffer() first.

  INPUTS
    req - pointer to requester (may be NULL).

  RESULT
    none

  NAME  rtChangeReqAttrA()

    [long =] rtChangeReqAttrA (req, taglist);

    [LONG] rtChangeReqAttrA (APTR, struct TagItem *);
                      A1    A0

    [long =] rtChangeReqAttr (req, tag1,...);

    [LONG] rtChangeReqAttr (APTR, Tag,...);

  DESCRIPTION
    Change requester attributes with supplied taglist.  This is the only
    correct way to change the attributes listed below.

    The return code from rtChangeReqAttrA() should be ignored unless stated
    otherwise.

    Don't pass the tags listed below to the requester itself (unless
    documented otherwise).  They will not be recognized.

  INPUTS
    req     - pointer to requester.
    taglist - pointer to array of tags.

  TAGS
    for the file requester:
        RTFI_Dir         - (char *)
                           Name of new directory to position file requester
                           in. The requester's buffer will be deallocated.
        RTFI_MatchPat    - (char *)
                           New pattern string to match files on.
        RTFI_AddEntry    - (BPTR)
                           THIS *MUST* BE THE LAST TAG (just before TAG_END)!
                           Tagdata must hold a lock on a file or directory
                           you want to add to the file requester's buffer.
                           The lock should have been obtained using Lock(),
                           and you must unlock this lock yourself.
                           It is your responsibility to make sure the file
                           or directory is indeed in the directory the file
                           requester is in.
                           If the entry is already in the file requester's
                           buffer it will simply be updated.
                           It is harmless to use this tag if the requester's
                           buffer is not initialized. rtChangeReqAttr() will
                           return a boolean to indicate success or failure
                           (out of memory).
        RTFI_RemoveEntry - (char *)
                           Name of file or directory you want to remove from
                           the file requester's buffer.
                           It is your responsibility to make sure the file
                           or directory is indeed in the directory the file
                           requester is in.
                           It is harmless use this tag if the requester's
                           buffer is not initialized.
    for the font requester:
        RTFO_FontName    - (char *) 
                           Set the name of the currently selected font.
        RTFO_FontHeight  - (UWORD)
                           Set the fontsize of the currently selected font.
        RTFO_FontStyle   - (UBYTE)
                           Set the style of the current font.
        RTFO_FontFlags   - (UBYTE)
                           Set the flags of the current font.
    for the screenmode requester [V38]:
        RTSC_ModeFromScreen - (struct Screen *)
                              Screen to get mode attributes from.
                              NOTE: You must make sure the mode this screen
                                    is in will be accepted by the screen
                                    mode requester.  Otherwise it will auto-
                                    matically cancel.  For example, you use
                                    RTDI_ModeFromScreen on a HAM screen and
                                    you haven't set the SCREQF_NONSTDMODES
                                    flag.
                              Note that you must use this tag _before_ the
                              four tags below because this tag will set the
                              width, height, depth and autoscroll.
        RTSC_DisplayID      - (ULONG)
                              Set 32-bit mode id of selected mode.  The width
                              and height will be set to the default (visible)
                              width and height, and the depth will be set to
                              maximum.  Also read note above.  Note that you
                              must use this tag _before_ the three tags below
                              because this tag will set the width, height and
                              depth to default values.
        RTSC_DisplayWidth   - (UWORD)
                              Set width of display.  Must come after
                              RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.
        RTSC_DisplayHeight  - (UWORD)
                              Set height of display.  Must come after
                              RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.
        RTSC_DisplayDepth   - (UWORD)
                              Set depth of display.  Must come after
                              RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.
        RTSC_AutoScroll     - (BOOL)
                              Boolean state of autoscroll checkbox.
                              Must come after RTSC_ModeFromScreen tag.
        RTSC_OverscanType   - (ULONG)
                              Set type of overscan.  Set to 0 for regular
                              size, otherwise use OSCAN_... constants.
                              See 'intuition/screens.[h|i]'.

  NAME  rtCloseWindowSafely() [V38]

    rtCloseWindowSafely (window);

    void rtCloseWindowSafely (struct Window *);
                              A0

  DESCRIPTION
    Closes a window which shares its IDCMP port with another window.  All the
    pending messages (concerning this window) on the port will be removed and
    the window will be closed.

    Do not use this function to close windows which have an IDCMP port set up
    by Intuition.  If you do the port will be left in memory!

    If you intend to open a lot of windows all sharing the same IDCMP port it
    is easiest if you create a port yourself and open all windows with
    newwin.IDCMPFlags set to 0 (this tells Intuition to NOT set up an IDCMP
    port).  After opening the window set the win->UserPort to your message
    port and call ModifyIDCMP() to set your IDCMP flags.

    When you then receive messages from intuition check the imsg->IDCMPWindow
    field to find out what window they came from and act upon them.

    When closing your windows call rtCloseWindowSafely() for all of them and
    delete your message port.  Easy peasy :-)

    NOTE: Only call rtCloseWindowSafely() for windows with a shared IDCMP
          port.  Do *NOT* call it for windows with an IDCMP port created
          by Intuition!

  INPUTS
    window - pointer to the window to be closed.

  RESULT
    none

  NOTE
    This function is for the advanced ReqTools user.

reqtools.library/rtEZRequestA

  NAME  rtEZRequestA()

    ret = rtEZRequestA (bodyfmt, gadfmt, reqinfo, argarray, taglist);

    ULONG rtEZRequestA
                (char *, char *, struct rtReqInfo *, APTR, struct TagItem *);
    D0           A1      A2      A3                  A4    A0

    ret = rtEZRequest (bodyfmt, gadfmt, reqinfo, taglist, arg1, arg2,...);

    ULONG rtEZRequest
                  (char *, char *, struct rtReqInfo *, struct TagItem *,...);

    ret = rtEZRequestTags(bodyfmt, gadfmt, reqinfo, argarray, tag1,...);

    ULONG rtEZRequestTags(char *, char *, struct rtReqInfo *, APTR, Tag,...);

  DESCRIPTION
    This function puts up a requester for you and waits for a response from
    the user. If the response is positive, this procedure returns TRUE.
    If the response is negative, this procedure returns FALSE.
    The function may also return an IDCMP flag or a value corresponding with
    one of other possible responses (see below).

    'gadfmt' may contain several possible responses.  Separate these
    responses by a '|'.  For example: "Yes|No", or 'Yes|Maybe|No".  The
    responses should be typed in the same order as they will appear on
    screen, from left to right.  There is no limit to the number of responses
    other than the width of the screen the requester will appear on.

    'bodyfmt' can contain newlines ('\n', ASCII 10). This will cause a new
    line to be started (surprise, surprise :-).
    You may also include printf() style formatting codes. The format
    arguments should be pointed to by 'argarray'.
    You can use formatting codes in 'gadfmt' as well.  The arguments for
    this format string should follow the ones for 'bodyfmt'.

    NOTE: The formatting is done by exec.library/RawDoFmt(), so be aware that
          to display a 32-bit integer argument you must use "%ld", not "%d",
          since RawDoFmt() is "word-oriented."

    The second and third function use a variable number of arguments. These
    functions can be found in 'reqtools[nb].lib'.
    The second function has the RawDoFmt() arguments as variable args, the
    third the tags. If you need both this is what you can do:

    ...
       {
       ULONG tags[] = { RTEZ_ReqTitle, (ULONG)"mytitle", TAG_END };

       rtEZRequest ("String, num: %s, %ld", "Ok", NULL,
                                           (struct TagItem *)tags, "six", 6);
       }
    ...

    You can satisfy the requester with the following keyboard shortcuts:
      'Y' or Left Amiga 'V' for a positive response,
      ESC, 'N', 'R' or Left Amiga 'B' for a negative response.

    If EZREQF_NORETURNKEY is _not_ set (see RTEZ_Flags below) the RETURN key
    is also accepted as a shortcut for the positive response (can be changed
    using RTEZ_DefaultResponse, see below).  The response that will be
    selected when you press RETURN will be printed in bold.

    The EZREQF_LAMIGAQUAL flag should be used when you put up a requester
    for a destructive action (e.g. to delete something).  When it is set
    the keyboard shortcuts are limited to Left Amiga 'V' and 'B' so it is
    harder to accidently select something you will regret.
    Note that the RETURN and ESC key remain active!  To disable the RETURN
    key use the EZREQF_NORETURNKEY flag.  The ESC key cannot be disabled.

    You may pass a NULL for 'gadfmt', but make sure you know what you are
    doing.  Passing a NULL opens an EZRequester with NO responses, just a
    body text.  This implies the user has no means of "answering" this
    requester.  You must therefore use the RT_IDCMPFlags tag to allow some
    other events to end the requester (e.g. IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS,
    IDCMP_INACTIVEWINDOW,...) or you must make use of the ReqHandler feature.
    Using a requester handler you can end the requester by program control.
    This way you can e.g. put up a requester before you start loading a file
    and remove it after the file has been loaded.  Do not pass an empty
    string as 'gadfmt'!

    'reqinfo' can be used to customize the requester.  For greater control
    use the tags listed below.  The advantage of the rtReqInfo structure is
    that it is global, where tags have to be specified each function call.
    See libraries/reqtools.[hi] for a description of the rtReqInfo structure.

  INPUTS
    bodyfmt  - requester body text, can be format string a la RawDoFmt().
    gadfmt   - text for gadgets (left to right, separated by '|') or NULL.
    argarray - pointer to array of arguments for format string(s).
    reqinfo  - pointer to a rtReqInfo structure allocated with
               rtAllocRequest() or NULL.
    taglist  - pointer to a TagItem array.

  TAGS
    RT_Window       - (struct Window *)
                      Window that will be used to find the screen to put the
                      requester on.
                      If you supply this tag ReqTools will see if this window
                      is active.  If it is not the requester will also be
                      opened in inactive state.
                      You *MUST* supply this if you are a task calling this
                      function and not a process! This is because tasks
                      don't have a pr_WindowPtr.
    RT_IDCMPFlags   - (ULONG)
                      Extra idcmp flags to return on.  If one these IDCMP
                      flags causes the requester to abort the return code
                      will equal the flag in question.
    RT_ReqPos       - (ULONG)
                      One of the following:
                        REQPOS_POINTER    - requester appears where the mouse
                                            pointer is (default).
                        REQPOS_CENTERSCR  - requester is centered on the
                                            screen.
                        REQPOS_CENTERWIN  - requester is centered in the
                                            window (only works if the
                                            pr_WindowPtr of your process is
                                            valid or if you use RT_Window).
                                            If RT_Window is NULL the
                                            requester will be centered on
                                            the screen.
                        REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR - requester appears at the top left
                                            of the screen.
                        REQPOS_TOPLEFTWIN - requester appears at the top left
                                            of the window (only works if the
                                            pr_WindowPtr of your process is
                                            valid or if you use RT_Window).
                      The requester will always remain in the visible part of
                      the screen, so if you use the Workbench 2.0 ScreenMode
                      preferences editor to enlarge your Workbench screen and
                      you scroll around, the requester will always appear in
                      the part you can see.
                      REQPOS_CENTERSCR and REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR also apply to
                      the visible part of the screen. So if you use one of
                      these the requester will be appear in the center or the
                      top left off what you can see of the screen as opposed
                      to the entire screen.
                      REQPOS_CENTERWIN and REQPOS_TOPLEFTWIN fall back to
                      REQPOS_CENTERSCR or REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR respectively
                      when there is no parent window.  So you can safely use
                      these without worrying about the existence of a window.
    RT_LeftOffset   - (ULONG)
                      Offset of left edge of requester relative to position
                      specified with RT_ReqPos (does not offset the requester
                      when RT_ReqPos is REQPOS_POINTER).
    RT_TopOffset    - (ULONG)
                      Offset of top edge of requester relative to position
                      specified with RT_ReqPos (does not offset the requester
                      when RT_ReqPos is REQPOS_POINTER).
    RT_PubScrName   - (char *)
                      Name of public screen requester should appear on. When
                      this tag is used the RT_Window tag will be ignored.
                      If the public screen is not found the requester will
                      open on the default public screen.
                      Only works on Kickstart 2.0!  reqtools.library does
                      not check this, it is up to you *NOT* to use this tag
                      on Kickstart 1.3 or below!
                      Note that the 1.3 version of reqtools.library also
                      understands and supports this tag (on 2.0).
    RT_Screen       - (struct Screen *)
                      Address of screen to put requester on.  You should
                      never use this, use RT_Window or RT_PubScrName.
    RT_ReqHandler   - (struct rtHandlerInfo **)
                      Using this tag you can start an "asynchronous"
                      requester. ti_TagData of the tag must hold the address
                      of a pointer variable to a rtHandlerInfo structure.
                      The requester will initialize this pointer and will
                      return immediately after its normal initialization.
                      The return code will not be what you would normally
                      expect.  If the return code is _not_ equal to
                      CALL_HANDLER an error occurred and you should take
                      appropriate steps. If the return code was CALL_HANDLER
                      everything went ok and the requester will still be up!
                      See the explanation for rtReqHandlerA() below for the
                      following steps you have to take.
    RT_WaitPointer  - (BOOL)
                      If this is TRUE the window calling the requester will
                      get a standard wait pointer set while the requester is
                      up.  This will happen if you used the RT_Window tag or
                      if your process's pr_WindowPtr is valid.  Note that
                      after the requester has finished your window will be
                      ClearPointer()-ed.  If you used a custom pointer in
                      your window you will have to re-set it, or not use the
                      RT_WaitPointer tag and put up a wait pointer yourself.
                      If your program requires ReqTools V38 it is advised you
                      use RT_LockWindow instead.  Defaults to FALSE.
    RT_LockWindow   - (BOOL) [V38]
                      If this is TRUE the window calling the requester will
                      get locked.  It will no longer accept any user input
                      and it will get standard wait pointer set.  This will
                      happen only if you used the RT_Window tag or if your
                      process's pr_WindowPtr is valid.  RT_LockWindow will
                      restore a custom pointer if you have used one (unlike
                      RT_WaitPointer).  So you do not have to worry about
                      having to restore it yourself.  It is advised you use
                      this tag as much as possible. Defaults to FALSE.
                      Under Kickstart V39 the original window pointer will
                      not be restored if it was set using SetWindowPointer().
                      You will have to restore the pointer yourself in this
                      case.
    RT_ScreenToFront - (BOOL) [V38]
                      Boolean indicating whether to pop the screen the
                      requester will appear on to the front. Default is TRUE.
    RT_ShareIDCMP   - (BOOL) [V38]
                      Boolean indicating whether to share the IDCMP port of
                      the parent window. Use this tag together with the
                      RT_Window tag to indicate the window to share IDCMP
                      with. Sharing the IDCMP port produces less overhead,
                      so it is advised you use this tag. Defaults to FALSE.
    RT_Locale       - (struct Locale *) [V38]
                      Locale to determine what language to use for the
                      requester text.  If this tag is not used or its data
                      is NULL, the system's current default locale will be
                      used. Default NULL.
    RT_IntuiMsgFunc - (struct Hook *) [V38]
                      The requester will call this hook for each IDCMP
                      message it gets that doesn't belong to its window.
                      Only applies if you used the RT_ShareIDCMP tag to share
                      the IDCMP port with the parent window.  Parameters are
                      as follows:
                        A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                        A2 - (struct rtReqInfo *) your requester info
                        A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *) the message
                      After you have finished examining the message and your
                      hook returns, ReqTools will reply the message.  So do
                      not reply the message yourself!
    RT_Underscore   - (char) [V38]
                      Indicates the symbol that precedes the character in the
                      gadget label to be underscored.  This is to define a
                      keyboard shortcut for this gadget.  Example: to define
                      the key 'Q' as a keyboard shortcut for "Quit" and 'N'
                      for "Oh, No!" you would use the tag RT_Underscore, '_'
                      and pass as gadfmt "_Quit|Oh, _No!".  Do not use the
                      symbol '%' as it is used for string formatting.  The
                      usual character to use is '_' like in the example.
                      IMPORTANT: the shortcuts defined using RT_Underscore
                      take precedence of the default shortcuts!  It is for
                      example not wise to use a 'N' for a positive response!
                      Pick your shortcuts carefully!
    RT_TextAttr     - (struct TextAttr *) [V38]
                      Use this font for the requester.  Default is to use the
                      screen font.  Note that the font must already be
                      opened by you.  ReqTools will call OpenFont() on this
                      TextAttr, _not_ OpenDiskFont()!  If the font cannot be
                      opened using OpenFont() the default screen font will
                      be used.
    RTEZ_ReqTitle   - (char *)
                      Title of requester window, default is "Request" unless
                      the requester has less than 2 responses, then the
                      default title is "Information".
    RTEZ_Flags      - (ULONG)
                      Flags for rtEZRequestA():
                        EZREQF_NORETURNKEY - turn off the RETURN key as
                                             shortcut for positive response.
                        EZREQF_LAMIGAQUAL  - keyboard shortcuts are limited
                                             to Left Amiga 'V' and 'B', ESC
                                             and RETURN.
                        EZREQF_CENTERTEXT  - centers each line of body text
                                             in the requester window. Useful
                                             for about requesters.
    RTEZ_DefaultResponse - (ULONG)
                      Response value that will be returned when the user
                      presses the return key.  Will be ignored if the
                      EZREQF_NORETURNKEY flag is set.  The text for this
                      response will be printed in bold. Default is 1.

  RESULT
    ret - 1 (TRUE) for leftmost (positive) response, then each consecutive
          response will return 1 more, the rightmost (false) response will
          return 0 (FALSE), so 1,2,3,...,num-1,0 -- or idcmp flag.

  NOTE
    Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

    rtEZRequestA() checks the pr_WindowPtr of your process to find the
    screen to put the requester on.

  NAME  rtFileRequestA()

    ret = rtFileRequestA (filereq, filename, title, taglist);

    APTR rtFileRequestA
                (struct rtFileRequester *, char *, char *, struct TagItem *);
    D0           A1                        A2      A3      A0

    ret = rtFileRequest (filereq, filename, title, tag1,...);

    APTR rtFileRequest (struct rtFileRequester *, char *, char *, Tag,...);

  DESCRIPTION
    Get a directory and filename(s), or just a directory from the user.

    'filename' should point to an array of at least 108 chars.  The filename
    already in 'filename' will be displayed in the requester when it comes
    up.  When the requester returns 'filename' will probably have changed.

    Using certain tags may result in the calling of a caller-supplied hook.

    The hook will be called with A0 holding the address of your hook
    structure (you may use the h_Data field to your own liking), A2 a pointer
    to the requester structure calling the hook ('req') and A1 a pointer to
    an object.  The object is variable and depends on what your hook is for.

    This is an example of a hook suitable to be used with the RTFI_FilterFunc
    tag:

    SAS/C users can define their function thus:

    BOOL __asm __saveds filterfunc (register __a0 struct Hook *filterhook,
       register __a2 struct rtFileRequester *req,
       register __a1 struct FileInfoBlock *fib)
    {
       BOOL accepted = TRUE;

       /* examine fib to decide if you want this file in the requester */
       ...
       return (accepted);
    }

    Your hook structure should then be initialized like this:

       filterhook->h_Entry = filterfunc;
       /* in this case no need to initialize hook->h_SubEntry */
       filterhook->h_Data = your_userdata_if_needed;

    You can also use a stub written in machine code to call
    your function. (see 'utility/hooks.h')

  INPUTS
    filereq  - pointer to a struct rtFileRequester allocated with
               @{"rtAllocRequestA()" link "rtAllocRequestA" 0}.
    filename - pointer to an array of chars (must be 108 bytes big).
    title    - pointer to requester window title (null terminated).
    taglist  - pointer to a TagItem array.

    RT_IntuiMsgFunc    - (struct Hook *) [V38]
                         The requester will call this hook for each IDCMP
                         message it gets that doesn't belong to its window.
                         Only applies if you used the RT_ShareIDCMP tag to
                         share the IDCMP port with the parent window.
                         Parameters are as follows:
                           A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                           A2 - (struct rtFileRequester *) your requester
                           A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *) the message
                         After you have finished examining the message and
                         your hook returns, ReqTools will reply the message.
                         So do not reply the message yourself!
    RT_Underscore      - (char) [V38]
                         Indicates the symbol that precedes the character in
                         a gadget's label to be underscored.  This will also
                         define the keyboard shortcut for this gadget.
                         Currently only needed for RTFI_OkText.  Usually set
                         to '_'.
    RT_DefaultFont     - (struct TextFont *)
                         This tag allows you to specify the font to be used
                         in the requester when the screen font is
                         proportional. Default is GfxBase->DefaultFont.
                         This tag is obsolete in ReqTools 2.2 and higher.
    RT_TextAttr        - (struct TextAttr *) [V38]
                         Use this font for the requester. Default is to
                         use the screen font.  Note that the font must
                         already be opened by you.  ReqTools will call
                         OpenFont() on this TextAttr, _not_ OpenDiskFont()!
                         If the font cannot be opened using OpenFont() or if
                         the font is proportional the default screen font
                         will be used (or the font set with RT_DefaultFont).
    RTFI_Flags         - (ULONG)
                         Several flags:
                           FREQF_NOBUFFER    - do _not_ use a buffer to
                                               remember directory contents
                                               for the next time the file
                                               requester is used.
                           FREQF_MULTISELECT - allow multiple files to be
                                               selected. @{"rtFileRequest()" link "rtFileRequestA" 0} will
                                               return a pointer to an
                                               rtFileList structure which
                                               will contain all selected
                                               files.  Use @{"rtFreeFileList()" link "rtFreeFileList" 0}
                                               to free the memory used by
                                               this file list.
                           FREQF_SELECTDIRS  - set this flag if you wish to
                                               enable the selecting of dirs
                                               as well as files.  You *must*
                                               also set FREQF_MULTISELECT.
                                               Directories will be returned
                                               together with files in
                                               rtFileList, but with StrLen
                                               equal to -1.  If you need the
                                               length of the directory's name
                                               use strlen().
                           FREQF_SAVE        - Set this if you are using the
                                               requester to save or delete
                                               something.  Double-clicking
                                               will be disabled so it is
                                               harder to make a mistake and
                                               select the wrong file.  If the
                                               user enters a non-existent
                                               directory in the drawer string
                                               gadget, a requester will
                                               appear asking if the directory
                                               should be created.
                           FREQF_NOFILES     - Set this if you want to use
                                               the requester to allow the
                                               user to select a directory
                                               rather than a file.  Ideal for
                                               getting a destination dir. May
                                               be used with FREQF_MULTISELECT
                                               and FREQF_SELECTDIRS.
                           FREQF_PATGAD      - When this is set a pattern
                                               gadget will be added to the
                                               requester.
    RTFI_Height        - (ULONG)
                         Suggested height of file requester window.
    RTFI_OkText        - (char *)
                         Replacement text for "Ok" gadget, max 6 chars long.
    RTFI_VolumeRequest - (ULONG) [V38]
                         The presence of this tag turns the file requester
                         into a volume/assign disk requester.  This requester
                         can be used to get a device name ("DF0:", "DH1:",..)
                         or an assign ("C:", "FONTS:",...) from the user.
                         The result of this requester can be found in the
                         filereq->Dir field.  The volume can also be changed
                         with @{"rtChangeReqAttrA()" link "rtChangeReqAttrA" 0} and the RTFI_Dir tag.  Note
                         that the user may edit the disk/assign names, or
                         enter a new one.  Note also that the real device
                         name is returned, not the name of the volume in the
                         device.  For example "DH1:", not "Hard1:".
                         The tag data (ULONG) is used to set following flags:
                           VREQF_NOASSIGNS - Do not include the assigns in
                                             the list, only the real devices.
                           VREQF_NODISKS   - Do not include devices, just
                                             show the assigns.
                           VREQF_ALLDISKS  - Show _all_ devices.  Default
                                             behavior is to show only those
                                             devices which have valid disks
                                             inserted into them.  So if you
                                             have no disk in drive DF0: it
                                             will not show up.  Set this flag
                                             if you do want these devices
                                             included.
                         NOTE: Do *NOT* use { RTFI_VolumeRequest, TRUE }!
                               You are then setting the VREQF_NOASSIGNS flag!
                               Use { RTFI_VolumeRequest, 0 } for a normal
                               volume requester.
                         NOTE: If you use the RTFI_FilterFunc described
                               below the third parameter will be a pointer
                               to a rtVolumeEntry structure rather than a
                               pointer to a FileInfoBlock structure!
                               Tech note: the DOS device list has been
                               unlocked, so it is safe to e.g. Lock() this
                               device and call Info() on this lock.
                         NOTE: A file requester structure allocated with
                               @{"rtAllocRequest()" link "rtAllocRequestA" 0} should not be used for both
                               a file and a volume requester. Allocate two
                               requester structures if you need both a file
                               and a volume requester in your program!
    RTFI_FilterFunc    - (struct Hook *) [V38]
                         Call this hook for each file and directory in the
                         directory being read (or for each entry in the
                         volume requester).
                         Parameters are as follows:
                           A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                           A2 - (struct rtFileRequester *) your filereq
                           A1 - (struct FileInfoBlock *) fib of file OR
                                (struct rtVolumeEntry *) device or assign
                                in case of a volume requester.
                         If your hook returns TRUE the file will be accepted.
                         If it returns FALSE the file will be skipped and
                         will not appear in the requester.
                         IMPORTANT NOTE: If you change your hook's behavior
                                         you _MUST_ purge the requester's
                                         buffer (using @{"rtFreeReqBuffer()" link "rtFreeReqBuffer" 0})!
                         IMPORTANT NOTE: When this callback hook is called
                                         from a volume requester the
                                         pr_WindowPtr of your process will
                                         be set to -1 so *no* DOS requesters
                                         will appear when an error occurs!
    RTFI_AllowEmpty    - (BOOL) [V38]
                         If RTFI_AllowEmpty is TRUE an empty file string will
                         also be accepted and returned.  Defaults to FALSE,
                         meaning that if the user enters no filename the
                         requester will be canceled.  You should use this tag
                         as little as possible!

  RESULT
    ret - TRUE if the user selected a file (check 'filereq->Dir' for the
          directory and 'filename' for the filename) or FALSE if the
          requester was canceled -- or a pointer to a struct rtFileList
          (if FREQF_MULTISELECT was used).

  NOTE
    You CANNOT call the file requester from a task because it uses DOS calls!

    Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

    If the requester got too big for the screen because of a very large font,
    the topaz.font will be used.

    rtFileRequest() checks the @{"pr_WindowPtr" link "pr_WindowPtr" 0} of your process to find the
    screen to put the requester on.

    RT_IntuiMsgFunc   - (struct Hook *) [V38]
                        The requester will call this hook for each IDCMP
                        message it gets that doesn't belong to its window.
                        Only applies if you used the RT_ShareIDCMP tag to
                        share the IDCMP port with the parent window.
                        Parameters are as follows:
                          A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                          A2 - (struct rtFontRequester *) your requester
                          A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *) the message
                        After you have finished examining the message and
                        your hook returns, ReqTools will reply the message.
                        So do not reply the message yourself!
    RT_Underscore     - (char) [V38]
                        Indicates the symbol that precedes the character in
                        a gadget's label to be underscored.  This will also
                        define the keyboard shortcut for this gadget.
                        Currently only needed for RTFO_OkText.  Usually set
                        to '_'.
    RT_DefaultFont    - (struct TextFont *)
                        This tag allows you to specify the font to be used in
                        the requester when the screen font is proportional.
                        Default is GfxBase->DefaultFont.
                        This tag is obsolete in ReqTools 2.2 and higher.
    RT_TextAttr       - [V38] see rtFileRequestA()
    RTFO_Flags        - (ULONG)
                        Several flags:
                          FREQF_NOBUFFER      - do not buffer the font list
                                                for subsequent calls to
                                                rtFontRequestA().
                          FREQF_FIXEDWIDTH    - only show fixed-width fonts.
                          FREQF_COLORFONTS    - show color fonts also.
                          FREQF_CHANGEPALETTE - change the screen's palette
                                                to match that of a selected
                                                color font.
                          FREQF_LEAVEPALETTE  - leave the palette as it is
                                                when exiting rtFontRequestA()
                                                Useful in combination with
                                                FREQF_CHANGEPALETTE.
                          FREQF_SCALE         - allow fonts to be scaled
                                                when they don't exist in the
                                                requested size.
                                                (works on Kickstart 2.0 only,

                                                 has no effect on 1.2/1.3).
                          FREQF_STYLE         - include gadgets so the user
                                                may select the font's style.
    RTFO_Height       - (ULONG)
                        Suggested height of font requester window.
    RTFO_OkText       - (char *)
                        Replacement text for "Ok" gadget.  Maximum 6 chars.
                        (7 is still ok, but not esthetically pleasing)
    RTFO_SampleHeight - (ULONG)
                        Height of font sample display in pixels (default 24).
    RTFO_MinHeight    - (ULONG)
                        Minimum font size displayed.
    RTFO_MaxHeight    - (ULONG)
                        Maximum font size displayed.
    RTFO_FilterFunc   - (struct Hook *) [V38]
                        Call this hook for each available font.
                        Parameters are as follows:
                          A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                          A2 - (struct rtFontRequester *) your filereq
                          A1 - (struct TextAttr *) textattr of font
                        If your hook returns TRUE the font will be accepted.
                        If it returns FALSE the font will be skipped and
                        will not appear in the requester.
                        IMPORTANT NOTE:  If you change your hook's behavior
                        you _MUST_ purge the requester's buffer (using
                        @{"rtFreeReqBuffer()" link "rtFreeReqBuffer" 0})!

  RESULT
    bool - TRUE if the user selected a font (freq->Attr holds the font),
           FALSE if the requester was canceled.

  NOTE
    You CANNOT call the font requester from a task because it may use DOS
    calls!

    Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

    If the requester got too big for the screen because of a very large font,
    the topaz.font will be used.

    rtFontRequest() checks the @{"pr_WindowPtr" link "pr_WindowPtr" 0} of your process to find the
    screen to put the requester on.

    This will also free all buffers associated with the requester, so there
    is no need to call @{"rtFreeReqBuffer()" link "rtFreeReqBuffer" 0} first.

  INPUTS
    req - pointer to requester (may be NULL).

  RESULT
    none

    ret = rtGetLong (&longvar, title, reqinfo, tag1,...);

    ULONG rtGetLong (ULONG *, char *, struct rtReqInfo *, Tag,...);

  DESCRIPTION
    Puts up a requester to get a signed long (32-bit) number from the user.

    'reqinfo' can be used to customize the requester.  For greater control
    use the tags listed below.  The advantage of the rtReqInfo structure is
    that it is global, where tags have to be specified each function call.
    See libraries/reqtools.[hi] for a description of the rtReqInfo structure.

  INPUTS
    &longvar - address of long (32 bit!) variable to hold result.
    title    - pointer to null terminated title of requester window.
    reqinfo  - pointer to a rtReqInfo structure allocated with
               @{"rtAllocRequest()" link "rtAllocRequestA" 0} or NULL.
    taglist  - pointer to a TagItem array.

                       Note that under 1.2/1.3 the string gadget's font
                       will remain the screen font.
    RTGL_Min         - (ULONG)
                       Minimum allowed value. If the user tries to enter a
                       smaller value the requester will refuse to accept it.
    RTGL_Max         - (ULONG)
                       Maximum allowed value, higher values are refused.
    RTGL_Width       - (ULONG)
                       Width of requester window in pixels.  This is only a
                       suggestion. rtGetLongA() will not go below a
                       certain width.
    RTGL_ShowDefault - (BOOL)
                       If this is TRUE (default) the value already in
                       'longvar' will be displayed in the requester when it
                       comes up. If set to FALSE the requester will be empty.
    RTGL_GadFmt      - (char *) [V38]
                       Using this tag you can offer the user several
                       responses.  See rtEZRequestA() for more information.
                       Note that selecting this gadget is considered a
                       positive response so the integer in the gadget is
                       copied to '&longvar'.
    RTGL_GadFmtArgs  - (APTR) [V38]
                       If you used formatting codes with RTGL_GadFmt use this
                       tag to pass the arguments.
    RTGL_Invisible   - (BOOL) [V38]
                       Using this tag you can switch on invisible typing.
                       Very useful if you need to get something like a
                       code number from the user.  It is strongly advised to
                       use { RTGL_ShowDefault, FALSE } or the user may get 
                       very confused!  Default is FALSE.
    RTGL_BackFill    - (BOOL) [V38]
                       Backfill requester window with pattern.  Default TRUE.
    RTGL_TextFmt     - (char *) [V38]
                       Print these lines of text above the gadget in the
                       requester.  Very useful to inform the user of what
                       he should enter.  Most of the time you will also want
                       to set the GLREQF_CENTERTEXT flag.  If you set the
                       RTGL_BackFill tag to FALSE _no_ recessed border will
                       be placed around the text.  Formatting codes may be
                       used in the string (see RTGL_TextFmtArgs tag).
    RTGL_TextFmtArgs - (APTR) [V38]
                       If you used formatting codes with RTGL_TextFmt use
                       this tag to pass the arguments.
    RTGL_Flags       - (ULONG) [V38]
                         GLREQF_CENTERTEXT    - centers each line of text
                                                above the gadget in the
                                                requester window. Should
                                                be generally set.
                         GLREQF_HIGHLIGHTTEXT - Highlight text above the
                                                gadget. You will normally
                                                only want to use this if you
                                                also turned off the window
                                                backfilling.

  RESULT
    ret - TRUE if user entered a number, FALSE if not. If one of your idcmp
          flags caused the requester to end 'ret' will hold this flag.
          If you used the RTGL_GadFmt tag the return code will hold the
          value of the response as with rtEZRequestA().

  NOTE
    'longvar' will NOT change if the requester is aborted.

    Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

    rtGetLongA() checks the @{"pr_WindowPtr" link "pr_WindowPtr" 0} of your process to find the
    screen to put the requester on.

    If you use the RTGL_GadFmt tag the return value is not always the gadget
    the user selected.  If the integer gadget is empty and the user presses
    the leftmost gadget (normally 'Ok') rtGetLong() will return 0 (FALSE)!
    If the integer gadget is empty and the user presses one of the other
    gadgets rtGetLong() _will_ return its value!  Important: &longvar will
    not be changed in either of these cases.

  DESCRIPTION
    Puts up a string requester to get a line of text from the user.
    The string present in 'buffer' upon entry will be displayed, ready to
    be edited.

    'reqinfo' can be used to customize the requester.  For greater control

  INPUTS
    buffer   - pointer to buffer to hold characters entered.
    maxchars - maximum number of characters that fit in buffer (EX-cluding
               the 0 to terminate the string !).
    title    - pointer to null terminated title of requester window.
    reqinfo  - pointer to a rtReqInfo structure allocated with

    RTGS_Width       - (ULONG)
                       Width of requester window in pixels.  This is only a

    RTGS_AllowEmpty  - (BOOL)
                       If RTGS_AllowEmpty is TRUE an empty string will also
                       be accepted and returned.  Defaults to FALSE, meaning
                       that if the user enters an empty string the requester
                       will be canceled.
    RTGS_GadFmt      - (char *) [V38]
                       Using this tag you can offer the user several

                       an empty initial string or the user may get very
                       confused!  Default is FALSE.
    RTGS_BackFill    - (BOOL) [V38]
                       Backfill requester window with pattern.  Default TRUE.

                                                backfilling.

  RESULT
    ret - TRUE if user entered something, FALSE if not. If one of your idcmp
          flags caused the requester to end 'ret' will hold this flag.
          If you used the RTGS_GadFmt tag the return code will hold the
          value of the response as with rtEZRequestA().

  NOTE

    D0                      A0               A1       A2

  DESCRIPTION
    Use this function to get the size of the visible portion of a screen.

    The value returned by rtGetVScreenSize() can be used for vertical
    spacing.  It will be larger for interlaced and productivity screens.
    Using this number for spacing will assure your requester will look
    good on an interlaced and a non-interlaced screen.

    Current return codes are 2 for non-interlaced and 4 for interlaced.
    These values may change in the future, don't depend on them too much.
    They will in any case remain of the same magnitude.

  INPUTS
    screen    - pointer to the screen.
    widthptr  - address of an ULONG variable to hold the width.
    heightptr - address of an ULONG variable to hold the height.

  RESULT
    spacing - vertical spacing for the screen.

  NOTE
    This function is for the advanced ReqTools user.

    windowlock = rtLockWindow (window);

    APTR rtLockWindow (struct Window *);
    D0                 A0

  DESCRIPTION
    Lock a window so it will no longer accept any user input.  The only
    functions left to the user are depth arrangement and window dragging.
    All gadgets will be un-selectable and the window can not be resized.
    It will also get the standard wait pointer set.  The pointer at the
    time of locking will be restored when the window is unlocked (this
    will *not* happen on Kickstart V39 or higher!).

    You may nest calls to rtLockWindow() and @{"rtUnlockWindow()" link "rtUnlockWindow" 0}.  Make sure
    you unlock the window in the correct (opposite) order.

    See the RT_LockWindow tag for an automatic way of locking your window.

    Use this function (and rtUnlockWindow()) instead of @{"rtSetWaitPointer()" link "rtSetWaitPointer" 0}.

  INPUTS
    window - pointer to the window to be locked.

  RESULT
    windowlock - a pointer to a (private) window lock.  You must pass this
                 to rtUnlockWindow() to unlock the window again.
                 Never mind if this is NULL.  This means there was not enough
                 memory and the window will not be locked.  There is no
                 sense in reporting this, just carry on and pass the NULL
                 window lock to rtUnlockWindow().

  NOTE
    The wait pointer will look exactly like the standard Workbench 2.0
    wait pointer.  In combination with PointerX, ClockTick or LacePointer
    the handle will turn.

    color = rtPaletteRequest (title, reqinfo, tag1,...);

    LONG rtPaletteRequest (char *, struct rtReqInfo *, Tag,...);

  DESCRIPTION
    Put up a palette requester so the user can change the screen's colors.

    The colors are changed in the viewport of the screen the requester will
    appear on, so that is where you will find them after the palette
    requester returns.

    The selected color is returned, so you can also use this requester to let
    the user select a color.

    'reqinfo' can be used to customize the requester.  For greater control
    use the tags listed below.  The advantage of the rtReqInfo structure is
    that it is global, where tags have to be specified each function call.
    See libraries/reqtools.[hi] for a description of the rtReqInfo structure.

  INPUTS
    title   - pointer to requester window title (null terminated).
    reqinfo - pointer to a rtReqInfo structure allocated with
              @{"rtAllocRequest()" link "rtAllocRequestA" 0} or NULL.
    taglist - pointer to a TagItem array.

                       This tag allows you to specify the font to be used in
                       the requester when the screen font is proportional.
                       Default is GfxBase->DefaultFont.
    RT_TextAttr      - [V38] see rtFileRequestA()
                       If the font is proportional on Kickstart 2.04 or
                       below ReqTools will use the system default font or
                       the font supplied with RT_DefaultFont.  On Kickstart
                       3.0 or higher the proportional font is used.
    RTPA_Color       - (ULONG)
                       Initially selected color of palette.  Default is 1.

  RESULT
    color - the color number of the selected color or -1 if the user
            canceled the requester.

  NOTE
    Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.
    On Kickstart 2.04 or lower, if the screen font is proportional the
    default font will be used.

    If the requester got too big for the screen because of a very large font,
    the topaz.font will be used.

    rtPaletteRequestA() checks the @{"pr_WindowPtr" link "pr_WindowPtr" 0} of your process to find the
    screen to put the requester on.

  NAME  rtReqHandlerA()

    ret = rtReqHandlerA (handlerinfo, sigs, taglist);

    ULONG rtReqHandlerA (struct rtHandlerInfo *, ULONG, struct TagItem *);
    D0                   A1                      D0     A0

    ret = rtReqHandler (handlerinfo, sigs, tag1,...);

    ULONG rtReqHandler (struct rtHandlerInfo *, ULONG, Tag,...);

  DESCRIPTION
    This function should be called if you used the RT_ReqHandler tag with a
    requester function.

    The requester you used the tag with will have returned immediately after
    its initialization and will have initialized a pointer to a rtHandlerInfo
    structure for you.
    You should now do the following:

    Check the DoNotWait field. If it is FALSE you have to wait for the
    signals in the WaitMask field (plus your own signals if you like).
    If any of the signals in WaitMask are received or DoNotWait was not FALSE
    you have to call rtReqHandlerA() and check its return value for one of
    the following values:

      CALL_HANDLER    - Check DoNotWait again, Wait() if you have to
                        and call rtReqHandlerA() again. In other words, loop.
      everything else - normal return value, requester has finished. This
                        return value will be the same as if the requester
                        had run normally.

    You must pass the signals you received to rtReqHandlerA().

    NOTE: if you want to wait for your own signals do not do so if
          DoNotWait is TRUE.  Call rtReqHandlerA() and if you must know
          if one of your signals arrived use SetSignal() to find this out.
          If you are waiting for a message to arrive at a message port you
          can simple call GetMsg() and check if it is non-null.
          DoNotWait will naturally only be TRUE when it absolutely,
          positively has to be.  A multitasking machine as the Amiga should
          use Wait() as much as possible.

    This is an example of a "requester loop":

    ...
    struct rtHandlerInfo *hinfo;
    ULONG ret, mymask, sigs;

    ...
       /* calculate our mask */
       mymask = 1 << win->UserPort->mp_SigBit;

       /* We use the RT_ReqHandler tag to cause the requester to return
          after initializing.
          Check the return value to see if this setup went ok. */
       if (@{"rtFontRequest" link "rtFontRequestA" 0}(req, "Font", RT_ReqHandler, &hinfo, TAG_END)
                                                           == CALL_HANDLER) {
          do {
            /* Wait() if we can */
            if (!hinfo->DoNotWait)
               sigs = Wait(hinfo->WaitMask | mymask);

            /* check our own message port */
            while (msg = GetMsg(win->UserPort)) {
               ...
               /* here we handle messages received at our windows IDCMP ...
                  port */
               ...
               }

            /* let the requester do its thing (remember to pass 'sigs') */
            ret = rtReqHandler(hinfo, sigs, TAG_END);

            /* continue this loop as long as the requester is up */
            } while (ret == CALL_HANDLER)

          /* when we get here we know the requester has finished, 'ret'
             is the return code. */
          ...
          }
       else notify("Error opening requester!");
    ...

  INPUTS
    handlerinfo - pointer to handler info structure initialized by using
                  the RT_ReqHandler tag when calling a requester function.
    sigs        - the signals received by previous wait, will be ignored if
                  hinfo->DoNotWait was TRUE.
    taglist     - pointer to a TagItem array.

  TAGS
    RTRH_EndRequest - supplying this tag will end the requester. The return
                      code from rtReqHandlerA() will _not_ be CALL_HANDLER,
                      but the requester return code.  If the tagdata of this
                      tag is REQ_CANCEL the requester will be canceled, if it
                      is REQ_OK the requester will be ok-ed.
                      In case of an @{"EZRequest" link "rtEZRequestA" 0} tagdata should be the return
                      code of the requester (TRUE, FALSE or 2,3,4,...).

  RESULT
    ret - CALL_HANDLER if you have to call rtReqHandlerA() again,
          or the normal return value from the requester.

  NAME  rtScreenModeRequestA() [V38]

    ret = rtScreenModeRequestA (screenmodereq, title, taglist);

    BOOL rtScreenModeRequestA 
                  (struct rtScreenModeRequester *, char *, struct TagItem *);

    BOOL rtScreenModeRequest
                           (struct rtScreenModeRequester *, char *, Tag,...);

  DESCRIPTION

    *IMPORTANT* THIS REQUESTER IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM KICKSTART 2.0 ONWARDS!
                The 1.3 version of ReqTools also contains the screenmode
                requester, but unless you are running 2.0 or higher it will
                not come up.  So what you essentially have to do is NOT
                call rtScreenModeRequestA() if your program is running on
                a machine with Kickstart 1.2/1.3.  You can safely call
                rtScreenModeRequestA() if you are running on a 2.0 machine,
                even if the user has installed the 1.3 version of ReqTools.

    Get a screen mode from the user.

    The user will be able to pick a screen mode by name, enter the size and
    the number of colors (bitplane depth).

    rtScreenModeRequestA() will call the appropriate 2.0 functions to get all
    the mode's information.  If no name has been assigned to the mode one
    will be constructed automatically.

  INPUTS
    screenmodereq - pointer to a struct rtScreenModeRequester allocated with
                    @{"rtAllocRequestA()" link "rtAllocRequestA" 0}.
    title         - pointer to requester window title (null terminated).
    taglist       - pointer to a TagItem array.

    RT_Locale          - see rtEZRequestA()
    RT_IntuiMsgFunc    - (struct Hook *) [V38]
                         The requester will call this hook for each IDCMP
                         message it gets that doesn't belong to its window.
                         Only applies if you used the RT_ShareIDCMP tag to
                         share the IDCMP port with the parent window.
                         Parameters are as follows:
                           A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                           A2 - (struct rtScreenModeRequester *) your req
                           A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *) the message
                         After you have finished examining the message and
                         your hook returns, ReqTools will reply the message.
                         So do not reply the message yourself!
    RT_Underscore      - (char) [V38]
                         Indicates the symbol that precedes the character in
                         a gadget's label to be underscored.  This will also
                         define the keyboard shortcut for this gadget.
                         Currently only needed for RTSC_OkText.  Usually set
                         to '_'.
    RT_DefaultFont     - (struct TextFont *)
                         This tag allows you to specify the font to be used
                         in the requester when the screen font is
                         proportional.  Default is GfxBase->DefaultFont.
                         This tag is obsolete in ReqTools 2.2 and higher.
    RT_TextAttr        - [V38] see @{"rtFileRequestA()" link "rtFileRequestA" 0}
    RTSC_Flags         - (ULONG)
                         Several flags:
                           SCREQF_OVERSCANGAD   - Add an overscan cycle
                                                  gadget to the requester.
                                                  After the requester returns
                                                  you may read the overscan
                                                  type in 'rq->OverscanType'
                                                  If this is 0 no overscan is

                                                  non-zero it holds one of
                                                  the OSCAN_... values
                                                  defined in the include file
                                                  'intuition/screens.[h|i]'.
                           SCREQF_AUTOSCROLLGAD - Add an autoscroll checkbox
                                                  gadget to the requester.
                                                  After the requester returns
                                                  read 'smreq->AutoScroll' to
                                                  see if the user prefers
                                                  autoscroll to be on or off.
                           SCREQF_SIZEGADS      - Add width and height
                                                  gadgets to the requester.
                                                  If you do not add these
                                                  gadgets the width and
                                                  height returned will be the
                                                  default width and height
                                                  for the selected overscan
                                                  type.
                           SCREQF_DEPTHGAD      - Add a depth slider gadget
                                                  to the requester.  If you
                                                  do not add a depth gadget,
                                                  the depth returned will be
                                                  the maximum depth this mode
                                                  can be opened in.
                           SCREQF_NONSTDMODES   - Include all modes. Unless
                                                  this flag is set
                                                  rtScreenModeRequestA()
                                                  will exclude nonstandard
                                                  modes.  Nonstandard modes
                                                  are presently HAM and EHB
                                                  (ExtraHalfBrite). So unless
                                                  you are picking a mode to
                                                  do some rendering in leave
                                                  this flag unset.  Without
                                                  this flag set the mode
                                                  returned will be a normal
                                                  bitplaned mode.
                           SCREQF_GUIMODES      - Set this flag if you are
                                                  getting a screen mode to
                                                  open a user interface
                                                  screen in.  The modes
                                                  shown will be standard
                                                  modes with a high enough
                                                  resolution (minumum 640
                                                  pixels).  If this flag is
                                                  set the SCREQF_NONSTDMODES
                                                  flag is ignored.
    RTSC_Height        - (ULONG)
                         Suggested height of screenmode requester window.
    RTSC_OkText        - (char *)
                         Replacement text for "Ok" gadget, max 6 chars long.
    RTSC_MinWidth      - (UWORD)
                         The minimum display width allowed.
    RTSC_MaxWidth      - (UWORD)
                         The maximum display width allowed.
    RTSC_MinHeight     - (UWORD)
                         The minimum display height allowed.
    RTSC_MaxHeight     - (UWORD)
                         The maximum display height allowed.
    RTSC_MinDepth      - (UWORD)
                         The minimum display depth allowed.  Modes with a
                         minimum display depth lower than this value will not
                         be included in the list.
    RTSC_MaxDepth      - (UWORD)
                         The maximum display depth allowed.
    RTSC_PropertyFlags - (ULONG)
                         A mode must have these property flags to be
                         included.  Only bits set in RTSC_PropertyMask are
                         considered.
    RTSC_PropertyMask  - (ULONG)
                         Mask to apply to RTSC_PropertyFlags to determine
                         which bits to consider.  See use of 'newsignals' and
                         'signalmask' in exec.library/SetSignal().  Default
                         is to consider all bits in RTSC_PropertyFlags as
                         significant.
    RTSC_FilterFunc    - (struct Hook *)
                         Call this hook for each display mode id in the
                         system's list.
                         Parameters are as follows:
                           A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                           A2 - (struct rtScreenModeRequester *) your req
                           A1 - (ULONG) 32-bit extended mode id
                         If your hook returns TRUE the mode will be accepted.
                         If it returns FALSE the mode will be skipped and
                         will not appear in the requester.

  RESULT
    ret - FALSE if the requester was canceled or TRUE if the user selected a
          screen mode (check 'smreq->DisplayID' for the 32-bit extended
          display mode, 'smreq->DisplayWidth' and 'smreq->DisplayHeight' for
          the display size, 'smreq->DisplayDepth' for the screen's depth).

  NOTE
    Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.

    If the requester got too big for the screen because of a very large font,
    the topaz.font will be used.

    rtScreenModeRequest() checks the @{"pr_WindowPtr" link "pr_WindowPtr" 0} of your process to find the
    screen to put the requester on.

  NAME  rtScreenToFrontSafely()

    rtScreenToFrontSafely (screen); 

    void rtScreenToFrontSafely (struct Screen *);
                                A0

  DESCRIPTION
    Brings the specified screen to the front of the display, but only after
    checking it is still in the list of currently open screens.

    This function can be used to bring a screen back to the front of the
    display after bringing another screen to the front.  If the first screen
    closed while you where busy it is harmless to call this function, unlike
    calling the normal ScreenToFront().

  INPUTS
    screen - pointer to the screen.

  RESULT
    none

  NOTE
    This function is for the advanced ReqTools user.

  NAME  rtSetReqPosition()

    rtSetReqPosition (reqpos, newwindow, screen, window);

    void rtSetReqPosition
               (ULONG, struct NewWindow *, struct Screen *, struct Window *);
                D0     A0                  A1               A2

  DESCRIPTION
    Sets newwindow->LeftEdge and newwindow->TopEdge according to reqpos.

    Except for the left- and topedge 'newwindow' must already be completely
    initialized.

    The newwindow->LeftEdge and newwindow->TopEdge already in the NewWindow
    structure will be used as offsets to the requested position.  If you'd
    like a window at position (25,18) from the top left of the screen you
    would fill newwindow->LeftEdge with 25, newwindow->TopEdge with 18 and
    call rtSetReqPosition() with reqpos equal to REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR.

    Don't forget to make sure newwindow->LeftEdge and newwindow->TopEdge
    are 0 if you don't want to offset your window.

    In case of REQPOS_POINTER you can use them to point to your window's
    hotspot, where the pointer should point.  If you call rtSetReqPosition()
    with the left- and topedge equal to 0 you'd get a window appearing with
    its top- and leftedge equal to the current pointer position.

    Note that the screen pointer may _NOT_ be NULL.  If you have your own
    window open you can supply yourwindow->WScreen to this function.

    The window pointer is only required if reqpos is REQPOS_CENTERWIN or
    REQPOS_TOPLEFTWIN.  Even in this case you may call rtSetReqPosition()
    with a NULL window pointer.  The positions will simply fall back to
    REQPOS_CENTERSCR and REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR respectively.

  INPUTS
    reqpos    - one of the REQPOS_... constants usable with RT_ReqPos.
    newwindow - pointer to your (already initialized) NewWindow structure.
    screen    - pointer to screen the requester will appear on.
    window    - pointer to parent window or NULL.

  RESULT
    none

    This function is for the advanced ReqTools user.

    rtSetWaitPointer (window);

    void rtSetWaitPointer (struct Window *);
                           A0

  DESCRIPTION
    Change the window's pointer image to that of a wait pointer.  Call this
    function whenever your program will be busy doing something for a lengthy
    period of time.

    It is recommended you call this function before calling any of the
    requester functions.  This way if the user clicks in your window he will
    know he must respond to the requester before doing anything else.  Also
    see the RT_WaitPointer tag for an automatic way of setting the wait
    pointer.  If you are using ReqTools V38+ check out the RT_LockWindow tag!

  INPUTS
    window - pointer to the window to receive the wait pointer.

  RESULT
    none

  NOTE
    The wait pointer will look exactly like the standard Workbench 2.0
    wait pointer.  In combination with PointerX, ClockTick or LacePointer
    the handle will turn.

                   A0       A1       D0     D1     D2     D3

  DESCRIPTION
    Evenly spread a number of objects over a certain length.
    Primary use is for arrangement of gadgets in a window.

    Example:

    'sizearray' holds following values: 4, 6, 4, 2 and 8,
    'totalsize' is 24 (= 4 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 8),
    'min' is 3, 'max' is 43,
    and finally, 'num' is 5.

    After calling rtSpread() 'posarray' would hold the following
    values: 3, 11, 19, 26 and 31.

    My attempt at a visual representation:

        |                                            |
        |  |                                      |  |
        |  OOOO    OOOOOO    OOOO    OO    OOOOOOOO  |
        |  |                                      |  |
        |         1    1    2    2    3    3    4    4
        0----5----0----5----0----5----0----5----0----5

  INPUTS
    posarray  - pointer to array to be filled with positions.
    sizearray - pointer to array of sizes.
    totalsize - total size of all objects (sum of all values in sizearray).
    min       - first position to use.
    max       - last position, first _NOT_ to use.
    num       - number of objects (size of posarray and sizearray).

    void rtUnlockWindow (struct Window *, APTR);
                         A0               A1

  DESCRIPTION
    Unlock a window previously locked with @{"rtLockWindow()" link "rtLockWindow" 0}.  The window will
    once again accept user input and will get its original mouse pointer
    back (default or custom).

    Under Kickstart V39 or higher the original window pointer will not be
    restored if it was set using SetWindowPointer().  You will have to
    restore the pointer yourself in this case.

  INPUTS
    window     - pointer to the window to be unlocked.
    windowlock - the windowlock pointer returned by @{"rtLockWindow()" link "rtLockWindow" 0}, may
                 be NULL.

                               LIBRARY HISTORY:

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0 (Library version 37.556
[1.3] - 37.670 [2.0])

    First release.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0a (Library version 37.557
[1.3] - 37.673 [2.0])

    Fixed two minor bugs:
      - if a directory could not be found and you re-invoked the file
        requester it wouldn't check the directory again.
      - devices like PRT:, CON:, etc. now no longer show up in the device
        list of the 2.0 file requester.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0b (Library version 37.566
[1.3] - 37.678 [2.0])

    Fixed bug: entering a pattern when a file requester's directory was
      invalid could cause a crash.
    rtGetString() and rtGetLong() 2.0 requester windows no longer have close
      gadgets.
    Font requester entries are "release verify" instead of "immediate".
    If no minimum or maximum is given for the GetLong requester it will not
      be displayed (1.0 and 1.0a displayed MAXINT or MININT).
    Minor cosmetic adjustments to file, font and palette requesters.
    Oberon interface to the library included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0c (Library version 37.592
[1.3] - 37.718 [2.0])

    Boopsi dispatch function for rtEZRequestA() buttons optimized (ReqTools
      for Kickstart 2.0).  Occasional flicker just about eliminated.
    Enlarged buttons a bit in rtGetLongA(), rtGetStringA() and the file, font
      and palette requesters.
    Width of scroller gadget in file requester window increased.
    File string gadget is cleared when 'All' or 'Match..' is used.  This
      wasn't done before and could result in unexpected multi-select results.
    Visual feedback for keyboard shortcuts improved (rtEZRequestA()).  Button
      stays depressed as long as the key in question is held down, but still
      for a minumum of 1/10 sec.  New feature:  shortcuts can be canceled by
      pressing Shift before releasing the key.
    Minor bug fix: keyboard shortcuts V and B now really only work together
      with the Left Amiga key.  Used to work without the qualifier.
    rtEZRequestA(), rtGetLongA() and rtGetStringA() will no longer call the
      DOS function Delay(), so they may from now on be called by tasks.
      Every ReqTools requester, except the file and font requesters (they use
      DOS for obvious reasons), can be called from a task.
    EZRequest with only one button now responds to the Return key, whether
      EZREQF_NORETURNKEY is set or not.
    Fixed small bug in libraries/reqtools.i include file.  rtfi_Hook and
      rtfo_Hook were followed by a ; and this could lead to problems.
    Libraries (reqtoolss.lib and reqtoolssr.lib) for Dice C included.
    Pre-release (0.91ß) of RTPatch patcher program included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0d (Library version 37.600
[1.3] - 37.726 [2.0])

    rtEZRequestA(), rtGetStringA() and rtGetLongA() now switch the processor
      stack to ensure sufficient stack space for the function to succeed.
    Fixed bug in rtGetLong() requester in 2.0 version of ReqTools.  Used to
      return TRUE and a random value if the user pressed Ok when the integer
      gadget was empty.
    File requester is somewhat larger by default.
    Improved automatic requester resizing (if requester would become too big
      for the screen).
    File requester (in save mode) no longer asks "Create drawer?" when you
      entered a drawer string containing a non-existing volume (e.g. 'FOO:').
    Entries in file requester are now sorted immediately when you select the
      slider gadget and not when you release it (1.3 version of ReqTools).
    Latest revision of Oberon interface included.
    Modula-2 interface to the library included.
    Manx C interface to the library included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0e (Library version 37.600
[1.3] - 37.726 [2.0])

    Rearranged directories a bit.  All glue code now in one directory.
    Installation script now uses Commodore's Installer utility.
    Two Modula-2 interfaces to the library are now included, one for M2Sprint
      and one for M2Amiga.
    Some bugs in the Dice C libs have been fixed (thanks to Magnus Holmgren).
    Interface for HiSoft's HighSpeed Pascal included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.0 (Library version 38.347
[1.3] - 38.693 [2.0])

    All requesters now have keyboard shortcuts.
    Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools has been localized.  As long as the
      appropriate catalog file exists ReqTools will appear in the user's
      selected langauge.
    New requester: rtScreenModeRequestA().  A screen mode requester. Can be
      used to get a screen mode, size, depth and overscan type from the user.
      This requester is only available on Kickstart 2.0 or higher, but also
      present in the Kickstart 1.3 version of ReqTools.
    File, font and screenmode requesters are now resizable (in height).
    Font, volume and screen mode requesters will now make sure the current
      entry is visible in the listview when the requester first comes up.
    Improved DOWILDFUNC hook interface.  New tag: RTxx_FilterFunc. Old hook
      interface (using req->Hook and FREQF_DOWILDFUNC flag) is still
      supported, but declared obsolete.  Don't use in new code.
    Several new tags:
      o RT_Locale:  specify a locale to be used instead of the default one.
        Ignored if locale.library isn't present in the system or you are
        using the Kickstart 1.3 version of ReqTools.
      o RT_ShareIDCMP and RT_IntuiMsgFunc:  All requesters can now share
        their IDCMP port with the parent window.  A callback hook for
        intuition messages received not concerning the requester can also be
        set using the RT_IntuiMsgFunc tag.
      o RT_LockWindow:  Enables you to make ReqTools lock the parent window
        from all user input and give the window a standard wait pointer.
        After the requester returns the window will be unlocked and will get
        its original pointer back.
      o RT_Underscore:  With this tag it is possible to define keyboard
        shortcuts for buttons.  You can ask ReqTools to underline a character
        in the button's label and use this as a shortcut.
      o for rtGetString() and rtGetLong(): RTGS_GadFmt, RTGS_GadFmtArgs,
        RTGL_GadFmt and RTGL_GadFmtArgs.  With these tags you may give the
        user several ways out of the string/long requester.
      o for rtGetString() and rtGetLong(): RTGS_Invisible and RTGL_Invisible.
        Can be used to switch on invisible typing to get a password or a code
        number from the user.
      o RTGS_TextFmt, RTGL_TextFmt, RTGS_TextFmtArgs and RTGL_TextFmtArgs:
        These tags allow you to supply some line(s) of text that should be
        printed above the string/integer gadget in the rtGetString() or
        rtGetLong() requesters.
      o RTGS_Flags and RTGL_Flags:  Set certain flags for rtGetString() and
        rtGetLong() requesters.  Used to set the GSREQF_CENTERTEXT or
        GLREQF_CENTERTEXT flags.
      o RTGS_BackFill and RTGL_BackFill:  Switch the patterned backfill in
        the rtGetString() and rtGetLong() requesters on or off.
      o RT_ScreenToFront:  Allows you to switch of the default behaviour of
        popping the screen the requester appears on to the front.
      o RT_TextAttr:  Allows you to specify a font a requester should use
        instead of the screen or default font.
      o RTFI_VolumeRequest:  New flavor of file requester: volume requester.
        Allows you to easily get a device/assign from the user.
      o RTFI_AllowEmpty:  Enables you to allow the file requester to accept
        an empty filename.  Normally cancels the requester if no filename
        was entered.
    Changes to file requester:
      o Shows disk percentage used next to volume names.
      o 'Hide .info' cycle gadget gadget in file requester replaced by
        '.info' toggle gadget next to filename string gadget.
      o Will no longer automatically change directories to their full
        pathname.  Will only do so when needed (e.g. parent of an assign).
      o Allows you to enter paths in the filename string gadget.  If the
        requester finds a path in the filename it will change the directory
        to that path.
      o Completely keyboard controlable: use up and down cursor keys to
        select files or directories.  Use Shift-Up and Shift-Down to jump
        by one window-full.
      o 1.3 version has a 2.0-look sizing gadget and bottom border.
      o Changed 'Disks' to 'Volumes'.
      o Changed '(dir)' to 'Drawer' (right justified).
      o Assigns now displayed differently (with 'Assign' right justified).
      o Added an indicator for number of selected files (if multiselect on).
      o No longer shows 'Add', 'Match..' and 'Clear' gadgets if no multi-
        select is possible.
    New library functions:
      o rtLockWindow() and rtUnlockWindow():  easily lock a window from user
        input and give it a standard wait pointer.
      o rtCloseWindowSafely():  close a window with a shared IDCMP port.
    Updated glue code:
      o Oberon interface updated for ReqTools V38.
      o SAS/C, Manx C and Dice glue code updated for ReqTools V38.
      o New HighSpeed Pascal (for ReqTools V38) interface written by
        Gunter Indenhoek included.
    Demo updated to demonstrate new features of ReqTools 2.0.
    Version 1.0 of RTPatch patcher program included.  Patches req.library,
      arp.library and asl.library to use ReqTools requesters instead.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.0a (Library version 38.350
[1.3] - 38.693 [2.0])

    Aaaargh!  Just one day after releasing ReqTools 2.0 a MAJOR bug turned
      up in the Kickstart 1.3 version:  rtLockWindow() was broken!!  Only
      turned up when running on 1.3, since on 1.3 there seems to be no return
      value from intuition.library/Request() (So C=, your autodocs have a bug
      in them as well :-).  Bug fixed.
    Fixed broken install script for Workbench 1.3.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.0b (Library version 38.358
[1.3] - 38.803 [2.0])

    Installer is no longer distributed with ReqTools. It is copyrighted by
      Commodore and can only be distributed under license. If you have
      Installer (preferably version 2.12 or higher) make sure it is in your
      command path so the install scripts will work. If you don't have
      Installer you'll have to install ReqTools manually, sorry.
    When you use the up/down arrows in the file requester and no file is
      highlighted yet, ReqTools will now highlight the file at the top of
      the visible area (instead of the first file in the list).
    Some small changes in demo, now demonstrates min/max with rtGetLong(),
      return value when RTGS_GadFmt is used and multi-selection in the file
      requester.
    Changed RTGL_BackFill and RTGS_BackFill tags to use the same spelling as
      WA_BackFill in intuition.h (with a capital F).  Be sure to install the
      new include files.
    Install scripts for Workbench 2.0 or higher now also try to update
      RTPatch (if the the file is found in C: or SYS:WbStartup).
    Added icons for install scripts for all 10 languages.  Install strings
      are all more or less translated.  Catalog translation files of all
      languages not supported yet are now also included, making it easier to
      translate ReqTools.
    From this release on ReqTools will make sure the Dir field of the file
      requester structure is pointing to the current directory while in the
      file filter callback hook (RTFI_FilterFunc).
    Changes in the Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools:
      o All requesters use simple refresh windows.  Window refreshing is a
        bit slower, but a lot of chip memory is saved.  Very important when
        you use the requesters on screens with a lot of colors/bitplanes.
      o All requesters have a backfill hook installed that will fill the
        background of the window with the DrawInfo pen BACKGROUNDPEN.  The
        DetailPen and BlockPen of the requesters will now also be set to
        DrawInfo pens (BACKGROUNDPEN and SHADOWPEN).
    Bug fixes:
      o When the RTGL_GadFmt or RTGS_GadFmt tag was used the requester did
        not return the correct value.
      o Small problem with requester resizing on virtual screens. Maximum
        number of entries was restricted to fit the visual area. The maximum
        height of the requester's window is now also set correctly.
      o Empty (current) directory no longer cancels the directory requester.
      o Font requester in Kickstart 1.3 version of the library didn't
        show a font if the font was previously opened in another height.
      o Field rt_Flags in 'libraries/reqtools.[hi]' changed to rt_RTFlags
        since it conflicted with the rt_Flags field in 'rexx/storage.[hi]'.
        Shouldn't cause any problems since the field was private anyway.
      o Entering a something like 'MAIL:/' to go to the parent directory
        of MAIL: now works.
    Some small errors and omissions fixed in the autodoc.
    French catalog revised by David Lebel.  Thank you David for correcting
      my lousy french :-)
    Italian and Swedish catalog files included (thanks Michele and Patrik).
    Updated/bug-fixed Oberon interface included.
    Version 1.0a of RTPatch included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.0c (Library version 38.362
[1.3] - 38.810 [2.0])

    Fixed Enforcer hit in file, font and screenmode requesters of the
      Kickstart 2.0 version of the library.
    Fixed bug: when the pr_WindowPtr of the calling process was -1 and you
      used a tag that needed a parent window (like RT_LockWindow or RT_ReqPos
      with REQPOS_CENTERWIN) ReqTools could crash.
    Pattern and drawer string gadgets no longer refresh the directory in the
      requester if they aren't changed.  Especially useful if you cycle
      through the string gadgets with TAB (Kickstart 2.0 version).
    Included a README file explaining ReqTools' installation scripts need
      Commodore's Installer utility.
    Include file 'libraries/reqtools.h' fixed.  This used a BPTR without
      including 'libraries/dos.h'. Thanks to Olaf Barthel for reporting this.
    Danish catalog file included (thanks Per).
    Version 1.0b of RTPatch included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1 (Library version 38.382
[1.3] - 38.961 [2.0])

    New major feature: ReqTools preference editor (Kickstart 2.0+ only)!
      o Switch screen to front popping on/off.
      o Display drawers before files in file requester.
      o Mix drawers and files in file requester.
      o Sort entries in file requester immediately.
      o Set default position of all requesters.
      o Set default size of file, font, screenmode and volume requesters.
      o Set minumum and maximum number of entries visible in file, font,
        screenmode and volume requesters.
    Kickstart 2.0 (or higher) version of ReqTools only:
      o The file requester will keep its top entry up to date with what is
        typed in the filename string gadget.  Pressing the up or down arrow
        will select the file that most closely matches the contents of the
        filename string gadget.
      o Entering of pathnames in the filename string gadget has been
        improved.  The file requester will now check if what you enter is a
        directory.  This allows you to enter directories without a trailing
        '/' (for example 'SYS:c').
      o rtSetWaitPointer() and rtLockWindow() will set the standard Intuition
        wait pointer on Kickstart 3.0 machines.  Note that rtUnlockWindow()
        will _not_ restore the original pointer if it was a new pointerclass
        pointer (Kickstart 3.0)!
      o File requester is an AppWindow now.  This means you can drop disk,
        drawer or file icons on the requester's window to go to a directory
        or select a file.
      o All requesters now set an appropriate bitplane write mask in the
        rastport of their windows.  This makes them render and scroll much
        faster on a screen with lots of bitplanes/colors.
    Available system fonts will now be buffered for _all_ font requesters.
      This speeds up font requesters enormously, a font scan is generally
      needed only once now.  The version of ReqTools for Kickstart 2.0 (or
      higher) has been made intelligent enough to see if the assign has been
      changed between two requests.  ReqTools will free the buffer when
      memory gets low.  Note that to accomplish this ReqTools keeps its
      library open count 0.  A real open count is kept internally.
    File requester will no longer show deferred (late) assigns.
    Several bug fixes:
      o Small bug: was no longer possible to exit volume/assign list by
        pressing Return in the drawer gadget without changing the directory.
      o Fixed weird bug with the selection of listview entries.  If you
        selected a non-existing item and dragged the mouse up, an item above
        all others would be complemented.  Thanks to Mathias Korsbäck for
        reporting this.
      o No longer goes into an endless loop when LOCALE: could not be found
        when a catalog had to be loaded.  Thanks to Holger Kruse for
        reporting this.
      o Resizing a file requester with an inexisting directory and with the
        volume list displayed resulted in a crash.
      o Some other miscellaneous bugfixes.
    Norwegian catalog file included (thanks Mario).
    Improved and bug fixed Dice C libraries included (by Magnus Holmgren).
      Includes libs for small code model, large code model and both of these
      with the arguments passed in registers.
    M2Amiga interface updated for ReqTools V38 by Frank Lömker.
    PCQ Pascal interface to the library included, written by Chris Pressey.
    Version 1.1 of RTPatch included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1a (Library version 38.385
[1.3] - 38.1002 [2.0])

    Serious bug fixed: file requester would crash if you tried to type a
      filename in a requester with a shared IDCMP port.
    Some other small bug fixes.
    rtGetString() and rtGetLong() will activate the string/integer gadget
      when the requester window becomes active.  This should make life easier
      for people using AutoPoint or other sunmouse-like utilities.
    New keyboard shortcuts for file requester:  pressing Control-Up/Down will
      bring you to the start/end of the directory list.
    Kickstart 2.0 (or higher) version of ReqTools only: Faster directory
      reading from a fast hard disk or ram disk.  The file requester now
      tries to read as many files as possible in .5 seconds. If this time-out
      expires, or all files have been read, the display is updated for the
      first time.  After this initial time-out period the display will be
      updated every .2 seconds.  This reduces the amount of rendering calls
      substantially and therefore results in faster directory loading.
    German catalog for preference editor included.  German strings in install
      script have also been updated (by Steffen Salzmann, thanks Steffen).
    Danish catalog for preference editor included (thanks Per).

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1b (Library version 38.388
[1.3] - 38.1017 [2.0])

    Recompiled with SAS/C 6.1: fixes bug of the filerequester not returning
      CALL_HANDLER when the RT_ReqHandler tag was used.  Seems SAS/C 6.0
      converted (APTR)0x80000000 to 0.  Don't you just love compiler bugs :-)
    File requester will clear the current selection when the filename string
      gadget is changed.  This allows you to use the filename completion
      multiple times in a row.  Also, using Amiga-X in the string gadget will
      no longer bring you to the start of the directory.
    RTSC_ModeFromScreen will now correctly set the autoscroll setting.  The
      default autoscroll setting is now also correctly read from the screen
      the requester will appear on.  Changed reqtools.doc to reflect this
      change.
    Volume and directory requesters will no longer exit when Shift Return is
      pressed (special request by per Jacobsen :-).
    Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools only:  Requesters with an inactive
      parent window (using the RT_Window tag) will also open in inactive
      state.  Suggested by Jorrit Tyberghein.
    Now respects EZREQF_NORETURNKEY flag also for single button EZRequesters,
      so the Return shortcut is disabled.  Thanks to Bert Wynants for
      pointing this out.  As a result of this most single-button requesters
      will have their buttontext printed in bold, showing you can use the
      return key.
    String gadget edit hook changed to be more according to the rules (using
      sgwork->EditOp instead of checking for Amiga-X and Amiga-Q by itself).
    Some small bugs in include files fixed.  Thanks to Magnus Holmgren and
      Per Jacobsen for reporting these.
    Italian catalog for preference editor included (thanks Michele).
    Spanish catalogs for library and preference editor included.  Translated
      by Juan Carlos Sanchez Garcia.  I had to edit the catalog for the
      preference editor so the prefs window would fit on a 640x200 screen.
      My apologies to spanish ReqTools users if I made mistakes in doing so.
    German catalog file for preference editor fixed.
    Version 1.1a of RTPatch included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1c (Library version 38.388
[1.3] - 38.1020 [2.0])

    Requesters with an inactive parent window will no longer open inactive.
      This new feature of ReqTools 2.1b was removed since it was more
      annoying than helpful.  Jorrit will be shot at dawn... ;-)
    Palette color spread function was broken in Kickstart 2.0 version of the
      library.  Fixed.  Thanks to Jesper Juul for reporting this bug.
    New danish catalogs and danish install text included (thanks Jesper).
    German catalog for library fixed, some keyboard shortcut keys were used
      twice.
    French catalog for preference editor included (thanks Benoit).

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1d (Library version 38.388
[1.3] - 38.1022 [2.0])

    Major new feature: rexx interface to the library.  RexxReqTools is a
      small library that offers lots of rexx commands to use just about all
      ReqTools requesters.  Many thanks to Rafael D'Halleweyn for writing
      this library and giving me permission to include it with ReqTools.
    Finally fixed the refresh bug in the Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools.
      Seems it was a bug in the 3.00 ROM.  ReqTools now uses the 'bug-less'
      ScrollWindowRaster() for its window scrolling on 3.0.  Thank you
      Peter Cherna! :-)
    A small bug popped up in the rewriting of the string gadget edit hook
      (Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools): keyboard shortcuts were no
      longer possible from integer gadgets.  Fixed.
    Added extra message to install script.  Must still be translated for all
      languages except english and dutch.
    Fixed bug in 'reqtools.i'.  Missing rtfi_IntuiMsgFunc, rtfo_IntuiMsgFunc
      and rtsc_IntuiMsgFunc caused several offsets to be wrong.  Thanks to
      Dirk Vangestel for reporting this.
    Fixed bug in SAS/C and Manx C glue code.  Stubs for rtReqHandler() and
      rtReqHandlerA() didn't save the A6 register.
    Included assembly version of demo source (converted by Dirk Vangestel).
    Most glue code has been archived with LhA (not everyone needs all the
      glue code, just de-archive what you need).
    Fixed enforcer hit in ReqTools preference editor, version 2.1a included.
    Version 1.1b of RTPatch included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1e (Library version 38.388
[1.3] - 38.1042 [2.0])

    Fixed bug in 'clib/reqtools_protos.h' include file: rtFontRequest() and
      rtScreenModeRequest() had wrong prototypes causing the ReqHandler
      feature to fail to work (without casting).  Thanks to Ebbe Holleris
      Petersen for reporting this problem.
    Fixed small problem in rtEZRequest() requester: if body text was too
      large to fit on the screen and was clipped you could not click on the
      requester's buttons.
    Fixed problem with leading '/' in paths entered in file string gadget.
    Fixed enforcer hits when typing in font requester size gadget.
    Fixed problem with first Shift Down in a file requester with less
      entries than are possibly visible selecting a non-existant entry.
    Fixed problem with typing a single '/' in the path gadget.  This caused
      the file requester to jump to the parent, but the path gadget was
      incorrectly cleared.
    Bug fix: palette requester didn't correctly restore the correct colors
      when it was canceled on an AGA machine with colors from a 24 bit
      palette.  Thanks to Felix Braun for reporting this.  Full AGA support
      will be something for the next release.
    Fixed bug in backfill code.  Didn't always clear window background
      properly on screens with more than 2 bitplanes.  Thanks to David Nouls
      for reporting this.
    Stack checking code in Kickstart 2.0 version of the library completely
      rewritten.  Now uses exec.library StackSwap() to swap the stack.
    Glue code for SAS/C enhanced.  Code hunks are now named 'text' instead
      of 'code', allowing real small code linking.  Glue code now supports
      the autoinitialization and autotermination feature of SAS/C 6.0.  If
      you define ReqToolsBase as external and link with reqtools.lib or
      reqtoolsnb.lib, reqtools.library will be automatically opened.
      Thanks to Brian Ipsen for the suggestion.
    Fixed small bug with rtSetWaitPointer() in HighSpeed Pascal interface.
    Portugese catalogs and install text for library and preference editor
      included.  Translated by Pedro Aguiar.
    Added 'Español' and 'Português' check boxes to languages in install
      script.
    German strings in install script updated by Steffen Salzmann.
    Swedish catalog for library adjusted a bit.
    GCC interface to the library included.  Written by Marc Duponcheel.
    Release 1.2b of RexxReqTools included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1f (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1095 [2.0])

    Screenmode requester now knows about EURO72, EURO36, SUPER72, DBLNTSC
      and DBLPAL monitors.
    rtGetVScreenSize() now uses VideoControl() if possible to get the
      visible screen size.
    File requester, font requester and screenmode requester now ignore
      all key presses before the requester is completely set up.  This
      should just about eliminate the problem of a gadget getting pressed
      because the user typed too quickly.
    File requester will use the device name of a volume if it's name is
      not unique (multiple floppies called 'Empty' for example).
    On Kickstart 3.0 or higher the file, font and screenmode requesters will
      use memory pools.
    Palette requester is now fully AGA compatible.  It uses the DisplayInfo
      database to find out the palette range of the screen it is opened on.
      It supports 256 colors out of a pallete of 16,8 million and should
      support even beyond that (not tested since there currently is nothing
      that goes beyond that :-).
    Bug fix: using the close gadget of the palette requester returned 0
      instead of -1 for cancel.
    Bug fix: rtGetLong() requester completely misplaced the min/max display
      when RTGL_TextFmt was used.
    Bug fix: fixed enforcer hits in file requester when FREQF_SELECTDIRS
      was used and a directory was double-clicked.
    Bug fix: font style handling of rtFontRequest() was almost completely
      broken.  Should work ok now.
    Bug fix: min/max display in rtGetLong() requester would become garbled
      during window-refreshing when the RT_ReqHandler feature was used.
    Bug fix: clearing the font name gadget in the rtFontRequest() requester
      and pressing Return caused the requester to return TRUE although
      the 'Cancel' gadget was visibly selected.  The requester now properly
      returns FALSE.
    Fixed some minor errors in include files and autodoc.
    Some updated catalogs included.
    French install text included, translated by Benoit Mortier.
    Release 1.2c of RexxReqTools included.
    Version 1.2 of RTPatch included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.2 (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1194 [2.0])

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE: All changes listed below are for the Kickstart 2.0 and higher
          version of the library (unless stated otherwise).  Development of
          the 1.3 compatible version of ReqTools has more or less stopped.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    File, font and screenmode are now able to use proportional fonts, making
      them truly font-sensitive.  Palette requester will accept and use a
      proportional font on Kickstart 3.0 or higher only.  Note: this
      required a small catalog change, so be sure to update your catalogs.
    Added cool LED indicator left of the drawer gadget in the file requester.
      People who dislike this can turn this feature off in the ReqTools 2.2
      preference editor.
    File requester will now make sure 'freq->Dir' and 'filename' are
      up-to-date when a callback hook is called (RTFI_FilterFunc and
      RT_IntuiMsgFunc).  If you want to rely on this please check for
      this _exact_ release of ReqTools (or higher of course).
    File requester will show file sizes in localized form now.
    Screenmode requester now handles color depths greater than 8192 colors
      correctly (will use 16K, 32K, 16M,... for high color values).
      Previously the window borders could get overwritten, oops :-)
    Removed hardcoded monitor names from screenmode requester code and made
      screenmode requester construct the name for an unnamed mode from the
      monitor name and dimensions.
    Bug fix: when the SCREQF_GUIMODES flag is used the screenmode requester
      will no longer show modes that haven't got the DIPF_IS_WB flag set.
      This fixes the problem of truecolor Picasso II modes showing up.
    Added a temporary workaround for a SAS/C bug (6.50 and earlier) creating
      incorrect code for taglist switches.  Programs with a missing TAG_END
      in one of their taglists will no longer crash (but are still buggy ;-)
    Changed rtLockWindow() and rtUnlockWindow() nesting code.  Should work
      much better now and allow for infinite nesting.
    Improved calculation of spacing value in rtGetVScreenSize(), will now
      properly return a spacing of 4 for A2024 monitor for example.
    Release 1.2e of RexxReqTools included.
    Version 2.2 of ReqTools preference editor included.
    Version 1.3 of RTPatch included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.2a (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1210 [2.0])

    Bug fix: on Kickstart 3.0 (V39) the palette requester's slider values
      were sometimes incorrectly displayed (palette requester will now only
      use GTJ_RIGHT on V40 or higher).
    Bug fix: if no locale.library was found (Workbench 2.04) the file and
      font requesters would display a 'D' instead of the file/font size.
    Bug fix: rtSpread() now handles the case where the total size of all
      objects is larger than the total available size correctly (objects will
      overlap in this case of course).
    Quirk fix: file requester will no longer overlap the button gadgets when
      they get too wide for the screen (german locale and lores screen for
      example).  It will scale the buttons in size to make them fit.
    Screenmode requester will no longer fail silently if the current mode
      is invalid.  It now simply picks the first mode id from the current
      list of modes.
    Changed display mode filtering code slightly to fix the problem with
      Picasso II monitor 2.14 (or higher) modes not showing up in the
      screenmode requester.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.2b (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1248 [2.0])

    Bug fix: screenmode requester had some selection problems on certain
      graphic cards (Spectrum, Merlin,...).  Should be fixed now.
    Directory requester will no longer hide the files in directories, but
      will show them ghosted now.  Note that directories will always be
      shown first in the directory requester, regardless of the ReqTools
      prefs setting.
    File requester now has directory completion as well as filename
      completion.  Pressing Alt up/down arrow will select the directory
      that most closely matches the contents of the filename string gadget.
    The file requester now also has volume and assign completion.  Using
      up/down arrow will select the closest matching volume.  Use the Alt
      qualifier to select the closest matching assign.
    The volume list will now first show the volume name, followed by the
      device name.
    New switch in the ReqTools preference editor to force the use of the
      system default font instead of the screen font in the file, volume,
      font, screenmode and palette requesters.
    Fixed enforcer hits in font and screenmode requesters when an intuition
      callback function (RT_IntuiMsgFunc tag) was used.
    Improved method of filtering DOS devices that are shown in the file and
      volume requesters.
    Palette requester: pressing either Alt key with the keyboard shortcut
      for red, green or blue will adjust the color value in steps of 8.
    Fixed SAS/C glue code to be compatible again with the autoinitialization
      and autotermination feature of SAS/C 6.50 and higher.
    Added SAS/C 6.x 'tagcall' pragmas to 'include/pragmas/reqtools.h'.
    Included new glue code for GCC.  Written by Gunther Nikl.
    Version 2.2b of ReqTools preference editor included.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.2c (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1266 [2.0])

    Since using VideoControl() to get the visible display clip only seems
      to work when the screen in question is the frontmost screen the
      rtGetVScreenSize() function now falls back to using QueryOverscan()
      for screens that are in the back (thanks to Dietmar Eilert for
      reporting this).
    Changed method of filtering DOS devices that are shown in the file and
      volume requesters again.
    Window size and gadget layout is now calculated in a sysihack compatible
      way.
    Bug fix: screenmode requester should no longer "lose" characters in the
      color slider values on Kickstarts below V40 (3.1).
    Bug fix: fixed enforcer hits that occured when the screenmode requester
      came up with an empty list (all modes filtered out e.g.).
    Minor bug fix: backfill pattern in EZRequesters now uses BACKGROUNDPEN
      instead of pen 0.
    Polish catalogs for library and preference editor included.  Translated
      by Juan Carlos Marcin Orlowski.

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.3 (Library version 38.1292)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE: Update work made by Magnus Holmgren. See start of this file for
          more information.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Release 1.3 of RexxReqTools included.
    Recompiled using DICE 3.01. This was forced by the fact that I don't
      have SAS/C (yet, at lest). As a result, the library now is a couple
      of KBs larger.
    Bug fix: screenmode requester now works better when showing a depth
      gadget for HAM screens. Most notably, the requester will not crash
      under certain circumstances, and will also handle HAM modes with a
      depth of 8 (earlier, only depth 6 was supported). The HAM support was
      a kind of hack, which was incomplete. Its still a hack, but it is
      better now. ;)
    In the file requester, when displaying the volumes list, RMB acts like
      pressing the Get gadget. I.e., you can go back to the original list
      by a simple RMB click. The "Volumes" gadget also acts like Get, if
      pressed while the volume list is displayed.
    The resizable requesters now uses "OS 3 zooming". I.e., the requester
      doesn't move (unless needed) when zoomed.
    Added zoom gadget for the palette requester. When zoomed, the
      requester resizes to "titlebar" size; again, using OS 3 zooming if
      possible.
    Updated the Swedish translation a little.
    In rtEZRequest, function keys can now be used to select the first ten
      gadgets, if enabled in the prefs editor.
    Added the 'Use function keys' option to the prefs program. Currently
      this is the only way to enable this function. In the future there
      will probably be a new tag/flag for this as well.
    Increased the stack some requester functions allocates, if needed.
      Should solve the crashing requesters with some programs when e.g.
      CyberGraphX is installed.
    Added missing tags to ReqTools.h (RTGL_CenterText and RTGS_CenterText).
    Fixed the prefs editor so that all gadgets are updated when new
      settings are loaded.
    Rewrote the DICE-C glue. Now includes autoopen code.
    New distribution layout. There are still two different archives, but
      the contents are different little:
      reqtools<ver>.lha is replaced with reqtools<ver>dev.lha, and contains
      only the developer files (glue, examples, includes and autodocs). The
      user archive (reqtools<ver>usr.lha) haven't changed.
    The filerequester (and the font- and screenmode requester as well) will
      now look better when the screen they open on have "strange" dri-pens.
    Support for OS 1.3 completely dropped. The 1.3 version of
      reqtools.library is no longer included.
    Made a minor change in the ASL patch in RTPatch, so that it returns
      errors more correctly (avoids annoying error requesters after having
      cancelled certain file requesters). I hope the reassemble didn't
      break anything. I haven't tested it much. ;)

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.4 (Library version 38.1296)

    As you may have noticed, a slightly different version numbering scheme
      have been adopted. I simply removed the letter extensions. ;)
    Fixed a problem in RTPatch, introduced in the re-assembly in 2.3. It
      would (often, but not always) print way too much text.
    Made some fixes to the installation script. I had forgot to change it.
      ;)
    Hopefully fixed the startup crash in the preferences editor.
    Included glue for Maxon Pascal, written by Falk Zuehlsdorff.
    rtEZRequestTags() was missing in new DICE glue.
    Fixed bug in password requester (used by powerpacker.library). DICE bug
      if you ask me. ;)
    French, Italian and Polish catalogs updated.

   SUPPORT BBS
   ~~~~~~~~~~~
   As the old support BBS (Great Balls Of Fire BBS) is located in another country, I will not myself upload the
latest version to it. However, I will try to upload the latest version on Aminet, from where many BBSes can get it.

   I am not familiar with the current status of the REQTOOLS FidoNet echomail area (where support previously was
available). If there is interest for this, I can contact some persons to try to reactivate it (in one way or
another).

@node "Introducion" "Introduction"
Introduction

    reqtools.library is a standard Amiga shared, runtime library.  The purpose of ReqTools is to make it a lot
quicker and easier to build standard requesters into your programs.  ReqTools is designed with Commodore's style
guidelines in mind, all requesters have the look-and-feel of AmigaDOS Release 2.

    If you use ReqTools in your programs you do not have to worry about requesters too much.  You'll have a lot more
time to concentrate on the really important stuff your program does.

    The library has been inspired by req.library (by Colin Fox & Bruce Dawson) and Commodore's own asl.library.  You
will find it shares a lot of the features with these two libraries, while it has some additional ones as well. While
asl.library was great in look-and-feel I felt it lacked quite a bit in the power department.  This power _is_ mostly
available in req.library, but this doesn't fit in too well with AmigaDOS Release 2.  So the idea for a new requester
library was born.

    I tried to make all requesters in ReqTools very powerful, easy to use and with a very nice new-look 3D
interface.  Efficiency was also considered very important.  The 2.0 version of the library is about 38K large.  I'm
sure you will agree this is not too much considering what ReqTools offers.

    ReqTools features the following requesters:  a query requester, a string requester, a number requester, a file
requester, a font requester, a palette requester and new in release 2.0 of ReqTools a volume requester and a screen
mode requester.

@node "Features" "Features"
Features

   The requesters have following features:

   All requesters:

      o have a pixel-perfect Workbench 2.0 3D look, also on Kickstart 1.3.
      o Completely localized!  If you are using Workbench 2.1 or higher the
        text in ReqTools requesters will appear in the language of your
        Workbench (if the catalog for this language is available).
      o adjust to interlaced screens and to the screen's font (@{"rtEZRequest" link "rtEZRequestA" 0},
        @{"rtGetLong" link "rtGetLongA" 0}, @{"rtGetString" link "rtGetStringA" 0}) or to any fixed-width font if the screen's
        font is proportional (@{"rtPaletteRequest" link "rtPaletteRequestA" 0}/@{"rtFileRequest" link "rtFileRequestA" 0}/@{"rtFontRequest" link "rtFontRequestA" 0}).
        Requesters can also use any suitable font you specify.
      o can appear under the mouse pointer, centered on the
        screen/in a window or at the top left of the screen/a window.
      o can be used asynchronously.
      o check @{"pr_WindowPtr" link "pr_WindowPtr" 0} of your process is to find the screen they should
        appear on (can be overridden).
      o use tags for maximum future extendibility.  All standard 2.0 tags
        are supported (like TAG_SKIP, TAG_MORE, etc.).
      o bring the screen they appear on to the front.  The screen that was
        in front previously will be put in front again when the requester
        finishes (if it is still open).
        This behaviour can be switched off.
      o will always appear in the visible portion of the screen (support of
        virtual screens).
      o are extensively tested using enforcer and mungwall debugging tools.
      o have the ability to lock the parent window from all user input and
        give it a standard wait pointer automatically.
      o can share the IDCMP port of the parent window.
      o supports a callback hook for handling IDCMP messages from a shared
        IDCMP port.
      o have keyboard shortcuts for gadgets (key underlined in gadget
        label). Use Right Amiga key with shortcut if a string gadget is
        active.
      o have a zoom gadget.

   @{"rtEZRequest" link "rtEZRequestA" 0}, the query requester:

      o easy keyboard shortcuts:
        - Left Amiga V and Left Amiga B (like the standard requesters).
        - Y for positive response.
        - N, R, Esc for negative response.
        - Return can also be used as a shortcut and can be
          associated with any response.  The gadget in question
          will have its text printed bold.
          Default response for Return is the positive response.
        - buttons give visual feedback when keyboard shortcuts
          are used.
        - keyboard shortcuts can be canceled by pressing Shift
          before releasing the key.
        - keyboard shortcuts can be defined to be any character in the
          button's label.  The character in question will be underlined. *NEW* - function keys can be used to select
the "first" ten gadgets.
      o number of responses only limited by screen width.
      o allows for multiple lines of text.
      o text can be centered in requester (great for about requesters).
      o supports the use of 'printf' formatting codes in text
        and in responses.
      o can be terminated by IDCMP events.

   @{"rtFileRequest" link "rtFileRequestA" 0}, the file requester:

      o similar in use and look-and-feel as Asl file requester.
      o buffers directories in memory.
      o files and directories can be added or removed from the buffer
        by the calling program.
      o can be put in save mode, disabling double-clicks and asking you if
        directories that can't be found (entered manually) should be
        created.
      o optional callback hook for verification of files before they are
        added to the buffer.
      o supports multiple selection of files and optionally of directories.
      o when multi-select is on All, Clear and Match.. buttons are
        available. All selects, and Clear unselects all files.  Match..
        brings up a requester where the user can enter a pattern to select
        files.
      o can be used as a directory requester (showing no files).
      o optional pattern gadget to match files on.
      o shows all devices (with volume names) and all assigns made.
      o supports TABCYCLE under 2.0
      o pattern matching supports _ALL_ AmigaDOS 2.0 patterns.
      o can be used as a volume requester to get a device or an assign
        from the user.
      o can be resized in height to show more files.
      o Shows disk percentage used next to volume names.
      o Allows you to enter paths in the filename string gadget.  If the
        requester finds a path in the filename it will change the directory
        to that path.  So if you e.g. enter 'Devs:mountlist' in the filename
        gadget the requester will read the 'Devs:' directory and set the
        filename gadget to 'mountlist'.  If you enter 'printers/' it will go
        into the printers directory. Enter '/' to go to the parent
        directory.
      o Completely keyboard controlable: use up and down cursor keys to
        select files or directories.  Use Shift-Up and Shift-Down to jump
        by one window-full.  Use Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down to jump to the start
        or end of the directory.

   @{"rtFontRequest" link "rtFontRequestA" 0}, the font requester:

      o buffers all fonts in memory.
      o shows sample of font you click on.
      o can be also be used to select the font's style.
      o supports color fonts, can change the screen's palette.
      o supports scaled fonts (AmigaOS Release 2 only).
      o optional callback hook for verification of fonts before they are
        added to the buffer.
      o supports TABCYCLE under 2.0
      o can be resized in height to show more fonts.
      o makes sure selected font is visible in listview when it comes up.

   @{"rtScreenModeRequest" link "rtScreenModeRequestA" 0}, the display mode requester (Kickstart 2.0+ only!):

      o all modes in the DisplayInfo database can be displayed.
      o allows you to pick a standard overscan setting.
      o user may enter prefered size or choose to get the defaults.
      o number of colors selectable.
      o can be put up with the attributes from a given screen.
      o optional callback hook for examining a display mode before it is
        added to the requester.
      o can be resized in height to show more modes.
      o makes sure selected mode is visible in listview when it comes up.

   @{"rtPaletteRequest" link "rtPaletteRequestA" 0}, the palette requester:

      o features Copy, Swap and Spread functions.
      o current values of red, green and blue are displayed.
      o returns the selected color.

   @{"rtGetLong" link "rtGetLongA" 0}, the long integer requester:

      o width of requester can be set by caller.
      o a minimum and maximum can be supplied and will be displayed
        in the requester.
      o a value to show up when the requester appears can be supplied.
      o can display buttons with several possible responses.
      o invisible entry is possible (useful for getting a code number).
      o patterned backfill of requester can be switched on or off.
      o some line(s) of (centered) text may be displayed above the entry
        gadget to give the user some extra information.

   @{"rtGetString" link "rtGetStringA" 0}, the string requester:

      o width of requester can be set by caller.
      o a string to show up when the requester appears can be supplied.
      o can display buttons with several possible responses.
      o invisible entry is possible (useful for getting a password).
      o patterned backfill of requester can be switched on or off.
      o some line(s) of (centered) text may be displayed above the entry
        gadget to give the user some extra information.

Installation

   To install reqtools.library copy it to your Libs: directory by hand, or run the installation script 'Install' (by
using 'Execute' from the Shell or by double-clicking its icon).

   If you are running Workbench 2.1 or higher you will have the possiblity to use ReqTools in different languages.
Just use the appropriate install script in the Install/Workbench_2.1+ directory.

@node "Using reqtools.library" "Using reqtools.library"
Using reqtools.library

   If you are a C programmer all you need to do is include the correct header ('libraries/reqtool.h') and open
reqtools.library. After that you can use the functions in the library as if they were C functions. If your program
quits it must of course close the library again. See 'demo.c' for an example.

   Glue code for several compilers/languages is included with ReqTools 2.4. Look in the Glue directory of the
ReqTools distribution to see if glue code exists for your compiler and/or programming language.  If it doesn't and
you write your own please send it to me and I'll include it in the next release of ReqTools.
   Note that the source for the Manx C libraries is the same as for the @{"SAS/C" link "SAS C" 0} libraries.  See the README.Manx file
in the archive 'Glue/Sas-C/LibSource.lha'.
   Manx C users may have to edit '@{"libraries/reqtools.h" link "<libraries/reqtools.h>" 0}' and change the library (GfxBase, IntuitionBase, etc.) fields
to rt_GfxBase, rt_IntuitionBase etc. Seems there is a bug in some versions of the Manx C compiler that has problems
otherwise.  Let's hope this gets fixed soon :-)

   Functions allowing a variable number of arguments can't be called using pragmas (in-line library calls, no glue
code required).  So if you use these you must always link with LIB:reqtools.lib or LIB:reqtoolsnb.lib (for SAS-C, or
with the specific libraries for your compiler/language).

   Assembly programmers should also include the correct files and open reqtools.library.  To call a function they
must load A6 with the library base, put the arguments in the appropriate registers and jump to the library vector
offset of the function they want to call.

   Remember to open the library with a specific version number if you wish to use features only found in that
version (for example: screen mode requester).

   All library functions are explained in the autodoc file 'reqtools.doc'.

                                                       Enjoy.

   This release is only a minor update, so I've tried to keep things as they were. I don't intend to make any major
work to the current sources (maybe some minor updates and bug fixes), as my intention is to make a (more or less)
complete rewrite of ReqTools. I have the famous TODO file @{"Nico" link "Contacting the author" 0} maintained, and I'll try to add any useful
suggestions found therein. There are also some other nice features planned, like e.g. an API (so that the
application - or external "modules" - can extent ReqTools). Exact details have not yet been worked out.

   If you have a suggestion you don't think is in the TODO file, feel free to tell me about it.

   Please contact me instead, for suggestions, remarks, bug reports and the like (btw, I prefer e-mail too). If you
are interested in updating RTPatch (for some reasons, I'm not really that interested in putting any large amount of
work into it ;), feel free to contact me as well.

   Nico sent me the sources since he didn't have the time to work on ReqTools.
