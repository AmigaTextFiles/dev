@node "Information" "AFrame Information"
  AFrame is a C++ OOP encapsulant for Intuition.  It
  allows the programmer to easily and quickly write
  programs that are flexable and easily coded.

  This is a preliminary version of AFrame, so only the
  include files, a .LIB and documentation in AmigaGuide
  format (we're still working on these, so bear with us)

  AFrames coders are:

    Jeff Worth - worth@emuvax.emich.edu
      IRC - Panique on #amiga
    Deryk Robosson newlook@free.org/nur_hutsko@emuvax.emich.edu
      IRC - newlook on #amiga

  Any comments, bug reports etc should be directed to myself
  or Jeff at either of the addresses above.

Distribution

  The programs and files in this distribution are freely distributable, but are also Copyright (c) Jeff Worth and
Deryk Robosson. They may be freely distributed as long as no more than a nominal fee is charged to cover time and
copying costs. AFrame is distributed as non-crippled shareware, it is fully functional.

Commercial Distribution

Commercial usage is allowed if the following conditions are met:

    a) You state in your documentation that your program uses aframe.library
       and that AFrame is Copyright (c) Jeff Worth and Deryk Robosson.

    b) You send us a copy of your finished product(s) using aframe.library.

  If these conditions are met you are allowed to include the Kickstart 2.0 or higher version of aframe.library and
the installation script(s) with your commercial product.



Freely Distibutable Products

  All of the files copyrighted by the authors must remain unmodified.  None of these files may be distributed on its
own, the entire package must be distributed as one whole.  'demo.cpp' is full public domain and can be used in any
way you like.

  There is one exception to the above.  If you plan to release a freely distributable program (either public domain,
freeware or shareware), you may include 'libs/aframe.library', the installation scripts (with icon), the
documentation (with icons) with your distribution.

If you include AFrame with a crippled shareware program I'd like to ask you to send us a full working version.

  Whether your program is freely distributable or commercial, you must state in your documentation that your program
uses aframe.library and that AFrame is Copyright (c) Jeff Worth and Deryk Robosson
