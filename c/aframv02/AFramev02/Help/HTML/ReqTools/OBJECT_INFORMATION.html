AFReqTools/Object Information<P>
<PRE>
  The ReqTools Object was written to provide a C++ Object Class interface to the reqtools.library.  Most of the</PRE>
functions are supported, but alas a few are not because we do not feel they are necessary at this time.  The class
may be updated to support the remaining functions if a need or desire arise.  This class is subject to change as
does the reqtools.library.
