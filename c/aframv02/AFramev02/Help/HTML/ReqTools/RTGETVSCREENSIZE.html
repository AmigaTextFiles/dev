  NAME RTGetVScreenSize()<P>

    ULONG spacing = RTGetVScreenSize(struct Screen *screen, ULONG *widthptr,
                                     ULONG *heightptr);<P>

  DESCRIPTION
    Use this function to get the size of the visible portion of a screen.<P>

    The value returned by RTGetVScreenSize() can be used for vertical
    spacing.  It will be larger for interlaced and productivity screens.
    Using this number for spacing will assure your requester will look
    good on an interlaced and a non-interlaced screen.<P>

    Current return codes are 2 for non-interlaced and 4 for interlaced.
    These values may change in the future, don't depend on them too much.
    They will in any case remain of the same magnitude.<P>

  NOTE
    This function is for the advanced ReqTools user.<P>

  INPUTS
    screen    - pointer to the screen.
    widthptr  - address of an ULONG variable to hold the width.
    heightptr - address of an ULONG variable to hold the height.<P>

  RESULT
    spacing - vertical spacing for the screen<P>

  BUGS
    none known<P>
