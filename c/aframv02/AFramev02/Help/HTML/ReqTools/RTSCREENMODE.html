  NAME RTScreenMode()<P>

    ret = RTScreenMode();<P>

    ret = RTScreenModeA(ULONG *)<P>

  DESCRIPTION<P>

    *IMPORTANT* THIS REQUESTER IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM KICKSTART 2.0 ONWARDS!
                The 1.3 version of ReqTools also contains the screenmode
                requester, but unless you are running 2.0 or higher it will
                not come up.  So what you essentially have to do is NOT
                call RTScreenModeA() if your program is running on
                a machine with Kickstart 1.2/1.3.  You can safely call
                RTScreenModeA() if you are running on a 2.0 machine,
                even if the user has installed the 1.3 version of ReqTools.<P>

    Get a screen mode from the user.<P>

    The user will be able to pick a screen mode by name, enter the size and
    the number of colors (bitplane depth).<P>

    rtScreenModeRequestA() will call the appropriate 2.0 functions to get all
    the mode's information.  If no name has been assigned to the mode one
    will be constructed automatically.<P>

  INPUTS
    If using RTScreenModeA it expects to see a taglist of items for customizing
    the requester.<P>

    EXAMPLE: ULONG taglist[] = { ITEM1, ITEM2, ITEM3, ..., TAG_END };<P>

  NOTE
    See reqtools developer documentation for descriptions of tag items which
    can be used with RTScreenModeA<P>

  RESULT
    TRUE if success
    FALSE if failure to open requester<P>

  BUGS
    none known<P>
