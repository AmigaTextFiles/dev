Features<P>
<PRE>
   The requesters have following features:<P>

   All requesters:<P>

      o have a pixel-perfect Workbench 2.0 3D look, also on Kickstart 1.3.
      o Completely localized!  If you are using Workbench 2.1 or higher the
        text in ReqTools requesters will appear in the language of your
        Workbench (if the catalog for this language is available).
      o adjust to interlaced screens and to the screen's font (<A href=rtEZRequestA.html>rtEZRequest</A>,
        <A href=rtGetLongA.html>rtGetLong</A>, <A href=rtGetStringA.html>rtGetString</A>) or to any fixed-width font if the screen's
        font is proportional (<A href=rtPaletteRequestA.html>rtPaletteRequest</A>/<A href=rtFileRequestA.html>rtFileRequest</A>/<A href=rtFontRequestA.html>rtFontRequest</A>).
        Requesters can also use any suitable font you specify.
      o can appear under the mouse pointer, centered on the
        screen/in a window or at the top left of the screen/a window.
      o can be used asynchronously.
      o check <A href=pr_WindowPtr.html>pr_WindowPtr</A> of your process is to find the screen they should
        appear on (can be overridden).
      o use tags for maximum future extendibility.  All standard 2.0 tags
        are supported (like TAG_SKIP, TAG_MORE, etc.).
      o bring the screen they appear on to the front.  The screen that was
        in front previously will be put in front again when the requester
        finishes (if it is still open).
        This behaviour can be switched off.
      o will always appear in the visible portion of the screen (support of
        virtual screens).
      o are extensively tested using enforcer and mungwall debugging tools.
      o have the ability to lock the parent window from all user input and
        give it a standard wait pointer automatically.
      o can share the IDCMP port of the parent window.
      o supports a callback hook for handling IDCMP messages from a shared
        IDCMP port.
      o have keyboard shortcuts for gadgets (key underlined in gadget
        label). Use Right Amiga key with shortcut if a string gadget is
        active.
      o have a zoom gadget.<P>

   <A href=rtEZRequestA.html>rtEZRequest</A>, the query requester:<P>

      o easy keyboard shortcuts:
        - Left Amiga V and Left Amiga B (like the standard requesters).
        - Y for positive response.
        - N, R, Esc for negative response.
        - Return can also be used as a shortcut and can be
          associated with any response.  The gadget in question
          will have its text printed bold.
          Default response for Return is the positive response.
        - buttons give visual feedback when keyboard shortcuts
          are used.
        - keyboard shortcuts can be canceled by pressing Shift
          before releasing the key.
        - keyboard shortcuts can be defined to be any character in the
          button's label.  The character in question will be underlined. *NEW* - function keys can be used to select</PRE>
the &quot;first&quot; ten gadgets.<PRE>
      o number of responses only limited by screen width.
      o allows for multiple lines of text.
      o text can be centered in requester (great for about requesters).
      o supports the use of 'printf' formatting codes in text
        and in responses.
      o can be terminated by IDCMP events.<P>

   <A href=rtFileRequestA.html>rtFileRequest</A>, the file requester:<P>

      o similar in use and look-and-feel as Asl file requester.
      o buffers directories in memory.
      o files and directories can be added or removed from the buffer
        by the calling program.
      o can be put in save mode, disabling double-clicks and asking you if
        directories that can't be found (entered manually) should be
        created.
      o optional callback hook for verification of files before they are
        added to the buffer.
      o supports multiple selection of files and optionally of directories.
      o when multi-select is on All, Clear and Match.. buttons are
        available. All selects, and Clear unselects all files.  Match..
        brings up a requester where the user can enter a pattern to select
        files.
      o can be used as a directory requester (showing no files).
      o optional pattern gadget to match files on.
      o shows all devices (with volume names) and all assigns made.
      o supports TABCYCLE under 2.0
      o pattern matching supports _ALL_ AmigaDOS 2.0 patterns.
      o can be used as a volume requester to get a device or an assign
        from the user.
      o can be resized in height to show more files.
      o Shows disk percentage used next to volume names.
      o Allows you to enter paths in the filename string gadget.  If the
        requester finds a path in the filename it will change the directory
        to that path.  So if you e.g. enter 'Devs:mountlist' in the filename
        gadget the requester will read the 'Devs:' directory and set the
        filename gadget to 'mountlist'.  If you enter 'printers/' it will go
        into the printers directory. Enter '/' to go to the parent
        directory.
      o Completely keyboard controlable: use up and down cursor keys to
        select files or directories.  Use Shift-Up and Shift-Down to jump
        by one window-full.  Use Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down to jump to the start
        or end of the directory.<P>

   <A href=rtFontRequestA.html>rtFontRequest</A>, the font requester:<P>

      o buffers all fonts in memory.
      o shows sample of font you click on.
      o can be also be used to select the font's style.
      o supports color fonts, can change the screen's palette.
      o supports scaled fonts (AmigaOS Release 2 only).
      o optional callback hook for verification of fonts before they are
        added to the buffer.
      o supports TABCYCLE under 2.0
      o can be resized in height to show more fonts.
      o makes sure selected font is visible in listview when it comes up.<P>

   <A href=rtScreenModeRequestA.html>rtScreenModeRequest</A>, the display mode requester (Kickstart 2.0+ only!):<P>
