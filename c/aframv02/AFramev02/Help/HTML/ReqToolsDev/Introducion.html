Introduction<P>
<PRE>
    reqtools.library is a standard Amiga shared, runtime library.  The purpose of ReqTools is to make it a lot</PRE>
quicker and easier to build standard requesters into your programs.  ReqTools is designed with Commodore's style
guidelines in mind, all requesters have the look-and-feel of AmigaDOS Release 2.<P>
<PRE>
    If you use ReqTools in your programs you do not have to worry about requesters too much.  You'll have a lot more</PRE>
time to concentrate on the really important stuff your program does.<P>
<PRE>
    The library has been inspired by req.library (by Colin Fox &amp; Bruce Dawson) and Commodore's own asl.library.  You</PRE>
will find it shares a lot of the features with these two libraries, while it has some additional ones as well. While
asl.library was great in look-and-feel I felt it lacked quite a bit in the power department.  This power _is_ mostly
available in req.library, but this doesn't fit in too well with AmigaDOS Release 2.  So the idea for a new requester
library was born.<P>
<PRE>
    I tried to make all requesters in ReqTools very powerful, easy to use and with a very nice new-look 3D</PRE>
interface.  Efficiency was also considered very important.  The 2.0 version of the library is about 38K large.  I'm
sure you will agree this is not too much considering what ReqTools offers.<P>
<PRE>
    ReqTools features the following requesters:  a query requester, a string requester, a number requester, a file</PRE>
requester, a font requester, a palette requester and new in release 2.0 of ReqTools a volume requester and a screen
mode requester.
