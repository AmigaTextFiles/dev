  NAME  rtSetWaitPointer()<P>

    rtSetWaitPointer (window);<P>

    void rtSetWaitPointer (struct Window *);
                           A0<P>

  DESCRIPTION
    Change the window's pointer image to that of a wait pointer.  Call this
    function whenever your program will be busy doing something for a lengthy
    period of time.<P>

    It is recommended you call this function before calling any of the
    requester functions.  This way if the user clicks in your window he will
    know he must respond to the requester before doing anything else.  Also
    see the RT_WaitPointer tag for an automatic way of setting the wait
    pointer.  If you are using ReqTools V38+ check out the RT_LockWindow tag!<P>

  INPUTS
    window - pointer to the window to receive the wait pointer.<P>

  RESULT
    none<P>

  NOTE
    The wait pointer will look exactly like the standard Workbench 2.0
    wait pointer.  In combination with PointerX, ClockTick or LacePointer
    the handle will turn.<P>

  BUGS
    none known<P>
