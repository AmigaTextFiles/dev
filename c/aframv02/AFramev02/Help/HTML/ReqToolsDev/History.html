                               LIBRARY HISTORY:<P>

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0 (Library version 37.556
[1.3] - 37.670 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    First release.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0a (Library version 37.557
[1.3] - 37.673 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Fixed two minor bugs:
      - if a directory could not be found and you re-invoked the file
        requester it wouldn't check the directory again.
      - devices like PRT:, CON:, etc. now no longer show up in the device
        list of the 2.0 file requester.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0b (Library version 37.566
[1.3] - 37.678 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Fixed bug: entering a pattern when a file requester's directory was
      invalid could cause a crash.
    rtGetString() and rtGetLong() 2.0 requester windows no longer have close
      gadgets.
    Font requester entries are &quot;release verify&quot; instead of &quot;immediate&quot;.
    If no minimum or maximum is given for the GetLong requester it will not
      be displayed (1.0 and 1.0a displayed MAXINT or MININT).
    Minor cosmetic adjustments to file, font and palette requesters.
    Oberon interface to the library included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0c (Library version 37.592
[1.3] - 37.718 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Boopsi dispatch function for rtEZRequestA() buttons optimized (ReqTools
      for Kickstart 2.0).  Occasional flicker just about eliminated.
    Enlarged buttons a bit in rtGetLongA(), rtGetStringA() and the file, font
      and palette requesters.
    Width of scroller gadget in file requester window increased.
    File string gadget is cleared when 'All' or 'Match..' is used.  This
      wasn't done before and could result in unexpected multi-select results.
    Visual feedback for keyboard shortcuts improved (rtEZRequestA()).  Button
      stays depressed as long as the key in question is held down, but still
      for a minumum of 1/10 sec.  New feature:  shortcuts can be canceled by
      pressing Shift before releasing the key.
    Minor bug fix: keyboard shortcuts V and B now really only work together
      with the Left Amiga key.  Used to work without the qualifier.
    rtEZRequestA(), rtGetLongA() and rtGetStringA() will no longer call the
      DOS function Delay(), so they may from now on be called by tasks.
      Every ReqTools requester, except the file and font requesters (they use
      DOS for obvious reasons), can be called from a task.
    EZRequest with only one button now responds to the Return key, whether
      EZREQF_NORETURNKEY is set or not.
    Fixed small bug in libraries/reqtools.i include file.  rtfi_Hook and
      rtfo_Hook were followed by a ; and this could lead to problems.
    Libraries (reqtoolss.lib and reqtoolssr.lib) for Dice C included.
    Pre-release (0.91ß) of RTPatch patcher program included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0d (Library version 37.600
[1.3] - 37.726 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    rtEZRequestA(), rtGetStringA() and rtGetLongA() now switch the processor
      stack to ensure sufficient stack space for the function to succeed.
    Fixed bug in rtGetLong() requester in 2.0 version of ReqTools.  Used to
      return TRUE and a random value if the user pressed Ok when the integer
      gadget was empty.
    File requester is somewhat larger by default.
    Improved automatic requester resizing (if requester would become too big
      for the screen).
    File requester (in save mode) no longer asks &quot;Create drawer?&quot; when you
      entered a drawer string containing a non-existing volume (e.g. 'FOO:').
    Entries in file requester are now sorted immediately when you select the
      slider gadget and not when you release it (1.3 version of ReqTools).
    Latest revision of Oberon interface included.
    Modula-2 interface to the library included.
    Manx C interface to the library included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 1.0e (Library version 37.600
[1.3] - 37.726 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Rearranged directories a bit.  All glue code now in one directory.
    Installation script now uses Commodore's Installer utility.
    Two Modula-2 interfaces to the library are now included, one for M2Sprint
      and one for M2Amiga.
    Some bugs in the Dice C libs have been fixed (thanks to Magnus Holmgren).
    Interface for HiSoft's HighSpeed Pascal included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.0 (Library version 38.347
[1.3] - 38.693 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    All requesters now have keyboard shortcuts.
    Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools has been localized.  As long as the
      appropriate catalog file exists ReqTools will appear in the user's
      selected langauge.
    New requester: rtScreenModeRequestA().  A screen mode requester. Can be
      used to get a screen mode, size, depth and overscan type from the user.
      This requester is only available on Kickstart 2.0 or higher, but also
      present in the Kickstart 1.3 version of ReqTools.
    File, font and screenmode requesters are now resizable (in height).
    Font, volume and screen mode requesters will now make sure the current
      entry is visible in the listview when the requester first comes up.
    Improved DOWILDFUNC hook interface.  New tag: RTxx_FilterFunc. Old hook
      interface (using req-&gt;Hook and FREQF_DOWILDFUNC flag) is still
      supported, but declared obsolete.  Don't use in new code.
    Several new tags:
      o RT_Locale:  specify a locale to be used instead of the default one.
        Ignored if locale.library isn't present in the system or you are
        using the Kickstart 1.3 version of ReqTools.
      o RT_ShareIDCMP and RT_IntuiMsgFunc:  All requesters can now share
        their IDCMP port with the parent window.  A callback hook for
        intuition messages received not concerning the requester can also be
        set using the RT_IntuiMsgFunc tag.
      o RT_LockWindow:  Enables you to make ReqTools lock the parent window
        from all user input and give the window a standard wait pointer.
        After the requester returns the window will be unlocked and will get
        its original pointer back.
      o RT_Underscore:  With this tag it is possible to define keyboard
        shortcuts for buttons.  You can ask ReqTools to underline a character
        in the button's label and use this as a shortcut.
      o for rtGetString() and rtGetLong(): RTGS_GadFmt, RTGS_GadFmtArgs,
        RTGL_GadFmt and RTGL_GadFmtArgs.  With these tags you may give the
        user several ways out of the string/long requester.
      o for rtGetString() and rtGetLong(): RTGS_Invisible and RTGL_Invisible.
        Can be used to switch on invisible typing to get a password or a code
        number from the user.
      o RTGS_TextFmt, RTGL_TextFmt, RTGS_TextFmtArgs and RTGL_TextFmtArgs:
        These tags allow you to supply some line(s) of text that should be
        printed above the string/integer gadget in the rtGetString() or
        rtGetLong() requesters.
      o RTGS_Flags and RTGL_Flags:  Set certain flags for rtGetString() and
        rtGetLong() requesters.  Used to set the GSREQF_CENTERTEXT or
        GLREQF_CENTERTEXT flags.
      o RTGS_BackFill and RTGL_BackFill:  Switch the patterned backfill in
        the rtGetString() and rtGetLong() requesters on or off.
      o RT_ScreenToFront:  Allows you to switch of the default behaviour of
        popping the screen the requester appears on to the front.
      o RT_TextAttr:  Allows you to specify a font a requester should use
        instead of the screen or default font.
      o RTFI_VolumeRequest:  New flavor of file requester: volume requester.
        Allows you to easily get a device/assign from the user.
      o RTFI_AllowEmpty:  Enables you to allow the file requester to accept
        an empty filename.  Normally cancels the requester if no filename
        was entered.
    Changes to file requester:
      o Shows disk percentage used next to volume names.
      o 'Hide .info' cycle gadget gadget in file requester replaced by
        '.info' toggle gadget next to filename string gadget.
      o Will no longer automatically change directories to their full
        pathname.  Will only do so when needed (e.g. parent of an assign).
      o Allows you to enter paths in the filename string gadget.  If the
        requester finds a path in the filename it will change the directory
        to that path.
      o Completely keyboard controlable: use up and down cursor keys to
        select files or directories.  Use Shift-Up and Shift-Down to jump
        by one window-full.
      o 1.3 version has a 2.0-look sizing gadget and bottom border.
      o Changed 'Disks' to 'Volumes'.
      o Changed '(dir)' to 'Drawer' (right justified).
      o Assigns now displayed differently (with 'Assign' right justified).
      o Added an indicator for number of selected files (if multiselect on).
      o No longer shows 'Add', 'Match..' and 'Clear' gadgets if no multi-
        select is possible.
    New library functions:
      o rtLockWindow() and rtUnlockWindow():  easily lock a window from user
        input and give it a standard wait pointer.
      o rtCloseWindowSafely():  close a window with a shared IDCMP port.
    Updated glue code:
      o Oberon interface updated for ReqTools V38.
      o SAS/C, Manx C and Dice glue code updated for ReqTools V38.
      o New HighSpeed Pascal (for ReqTools V38) interface written by
        Gunter Indenhoek included.
    Demo updated to demonstrate new features of ReqTools 2.0.
    Version 1.0 of RTPatch patcher program included.  Patches req.library,
      arp.library and asl.library to use ReqTools requesters instead.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.0a (Library version 38.350
[1.3] - 38.693 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Aaaargh!  Just one day after releasing ReqTools 2.0 a MAJOR bug turned
      up in the Kickstart 1.3 version:  rtLockWindow() was broken!!  Only
      turned up when running on 1.3, since on 1.3 there seems to be no return
      value from intuition.library/Request() (So C=, your autodocs have a bug
      in them as well :-).  Bug fixed.
    Fixed broken install script for Workbench 1.3.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.0b (Library version 38.358
[1.3] - 38.803 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Installer is no longer distributed with ReqTools. It is copyrighted by
      Commodore and can only be distributed under license. If you have
      Installer (preferably version 2.12 or higher) make sure it is in your
      command path so the install scripts will work. If you don't have
      Installer you'll have to install ReqTools manually, sorry.
    When you use the up/down arrows in the file requester and no file is
      highlighted yet, ReqTools will now highlight the file at the top of
      the visible area (instead of the first file in the list).
    Some small changes in demo, now demonstrates min/max with rtGetLong(),
      return value when RTGS_GadFmt is used and multi-selection in the file
      requester.
    Changed RTGL_BackFill and RTGS_BackFill tags to use the same spelling as
      WA_BackFill in intuition.h (with a capital F).  Be sure to install the
      new include files.
    Install scripts for Workbench 2.0 or higher now also try to update
      RTPatch (if the the file is found in C: or SYS:WbStartup).
    Added icons for install scripts for all 10 languages.  Install strings
      are all more or less translated.  Catalog translation files of all
      languages not supported yet are now also included, making it easier to
      translate ReqTools.
    From this release on ReqTools will make sure the Dir field of the file
      requester structure is pointing to the current directory while in the
      file filter callback hook (RTFI_FilterFunc).
    Changes in the Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools:
      o All requesters use simple refresh windows.  Window refreshing is a
        bit slower, but a lot of chip memory is saved.  Very important when
        you use the requesters on screens with a lot of colors/bitplanes.
      o All requesters have a backfill hook installed that will fill the
        background of the window with the DrawInfo pen BACKGROUNDPEN.  The
        DetailPen and BlockPen of the requesters will now also be set to
        DrawInfo pens (BACKGROUNDPEN and SHADOWPEN).
    Bug fixes:
      o When the RTGL_GadFmt or RTGS_GadFmt tag was used the requester did
        not return the correct value.
      o Small problem with requester resizing on virtual screens. Maximum
        number of entries was restricted to fit the visual area. The maximum
        height of the requester's window is now also set correctly.
      o Empty (current) directory no longer cancels the directory requester.
      o Font requester in Kickstart 1.3 version of the library didn't
        show a font if the font was previously opened in another height.
      o Field rt_Flags in 'libraries/reqtools.[hi]' changed to rt_RTFlags
        since it conflicted with the rt_Flags field in 'rexx/storage.[hi]'.
        Shouldn't cause any problems since the field was private anyway.
      o Entering a something like 'MAIL:/' to go to the parent directory
        of MAIL: now works.
    Some small errors and omissions fixed in the autodoc.
    French catalog revised by David Lebel.  Thank you David for correcting
      my lousy french :-)
    Italian and Swedish catalog files included (thanks Michele and Patrik).
    Updated/bug-fixed Oberon interface included.
    Version 1.0a of RTPatch included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.0c (Library version 38.362
[1.3] - 38.810 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Fixed Enforcer hit in file, font and screenmode requesters of the
      Kickstart 2.0 version of the library.
    Fixed bug: when the pr_WindowPtr of the calling process was -1 and you
      used a tag that needed a parent window (like RT_LockWindow or RT_ReqPos
      with REQPOS_CENTERWIN) ReqTools could crash.
    Pattern and drawer string gadgets no longer refresh the directory in the
      requester if they aren't changed.  Especially useful if you cycle
      through the string gadgets with TAB (Kickstart 2.0 version).
    Included a README file explaining ReqTools' installation scripts need
      Commodore's Installer utility.
    Include file 'libraries/reqtools.h' fixed.  This used a BPTR without
      including 'libraries/dos.h'. Thanks to Olaf Barthel for reporting this.
    Danish catalog file included (thanks Per).
    Version 1.0b of RTPatch included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1 (Library version 38.382
[1.3] - 38.961 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    New major feature: ReqTools preference editor (Kickstart 2.0+ only)!
      o Switch screen to front popping on/off.
      o Display drawers before files in file requester.
      o Mix drawers and files in file requester.
      o Sort entries in file requester immediately.
      o Set default position of all requesters.
      o Set default size of file, font, screenmode and volume requesters.
      o Set minumum and maximum number of entries visible in file, font,
        screenmode and volume requesters.
    Kickstart 2.0 (or higher) version of ReqTools only:
      o The file requester will keep its top entry up to date with what is
        typed in the filename string gadget.  Pressing the up or down arrow
        will select the file that most closely matches the contents of the
        filename string gadget.
      o Entering of pathnames in the filename string gadget has been
        improved.  The file requester will now check if what you enter is a
        directory.  This allows you to enter directories without a trailing
        '/' (for example 'SYS:c').
      o rtSetWaitPointer() and rtLockWindow() will set the standard Intuition
        wait pointer on Kickstart 3.0 machines.  Note that rtUnlockWindow()
        will _not_ restore the original pointer if it was a new pointerclass
        pointer (Kickstart 3.0)!
      o File requester is an AppWindow now.  This means you can drop disk,
        drawer or file icons on the requester's window to go to a directory
        or select a file.
      o All requesters now set an appropriate bitplane write mask in the
        rastport of their windows.  This makes them render and scroll much
        faster on a screen with lots of bitplanes/colors.
    Available system fonts will now be buffered for _all_ font requesters.
      This speeds up font requesters enormously, a font scan is generally
      needed only once now.  The version of ReqTools for Kickstart 2.0 (or
      higher) has been made intelligent enough to see if the assign has been
      changed between two requests.  ReqTools will free the buffer when
      memory gets low.  Note that to accomplish this ReqTools keeps its
      library open count 0.  A real open count is kept internally.
    File requester will no longer show deferred (late) assigns.
    Several bug fixes:
      o Small bug: was no longer possible to exit volume/assign list by
        pressing Return in the drawer gadget without changing the directory.
      o Fixed weird bug with the selection of listview entries.  If you
        selected a non-existing item and dragged the mouse up, an item above
        all others would be complemented.  Thanks to Mathias Korsbäck for
        reporting this.
      o No longer goes into an endless loop when LOCALE: could not be found
        when a catalog had to be loaded.  Thanks to Holger Kruse for
        reporting this.
      o Resizing a file requester with an inexisting directory and with the
        volume list displayed resulted in a crash.
      o Some other miscellaneous bugfixes.
    Norwegian catalog file included (thanks Mario).
    Improved and bug fixed Dice C libraries included (by Magnus Holmgren).
      Includes libs for small code model, large code model and both of these
      with the arguments passed in registers.
    M2Amiga interface updated for ReqTools V38 by Frank Lömker.
    PCQ Pascal interface to the library included, written by Chris Pressey.
    Version 1.1 of RTPatch included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1a (Library version 38.385
[1.3] - 38.1002 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Serious bug fixed: file requester would crash if you tried to type a
      filename in a requester with a shared IDCMP port.
    Some other small bug fixes.
    rtGetString() and rtGetLong() will activate the string/integer gadget
      when the requester window becomes active.  This should make life easier
      for people using AutoPoint or other sunmouse-like utilities.
    New keyboard shortcuts for file requester:  pressing Control-Up/Down will
      bring you to the start/end of the directory list.
    Kickstart 2.0 (or higher) version of ReqTools only: Faster directory
      reading from a fast hard disk or ram disk.  The file requester now
      tries to read as many files as possible in .5 seconds. If this time-out
      expires, or all files have been read, the display is updated for the
      first time.  After this initial time-out period the display will be
      updated every .2 seconds.  This reduces the amount of rendering calls
      substantially and therefore results in faster directory loading.
    German catalog for preference editor included.  German strings in install
      script have also been updated (by Steffen Salzmann, thanks Steffen).
    Danish catalog for preference editor included (thanks Per).<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1b (Library version 38.388
[1.3] - 38.1017 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Recompiled with SAS/C 6.1: fixes bug of the filerequester not returning
      CALL_HANDLER when the RT_ReqHandler tag was used.  Seems SAS/C 6.0
      converted (APTR)0x80000000 to 0.  Don't you just love compiler bugs :-)
    File requester will clear the current selection when the filename string
      gadget is changed.  This allows you to use the filename completion
      multiple times in a row.  Also, using Amiga-X in the string gadget will
      no longer bring you to the start of the directory.
    RTSC_ModeFromScreen will now correctly set the autoscroll setting.  The
      default autoscroll setting is now also correctly read from the screen
      the requester will appear on.  Changed reqtools.doc to reflect this
      change.
    Volume and directory requesters will no longer exit when Shift Return is
      pressed (special request by per Jacobsen :-).
    Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools only:  Requesters with an inactive
      parent window (using the RT_Window tag) will also open in inactive
      state.  Suggested by Jorrit Tyberghein.
    Now respects EZREQF_NORETURNKEY flag also for single button EZRequesters,
      so the Return shortcut is disabled.  Thanks to Bert Wynants for
      pointing this out.  As a result of this most single-button requesters
      will have their buttontext printed in bold, showing you can use the
      return key.
    String gadget edit hook changed to be more according to the rules (using
      sgwork-&gt;EditOp instead of checking for Amiga-X and Amiga-Q by itself).
    Some small bugs in include files fixed.  Thanks to Magnus Holmgren and
      Per Jacobsen for reporting these.
    Italian catalog for preference editor included (thanks Michele).
    Spanish catalogs for library and preference editor included.  Translated
      by Juan Carlos Sanchez Garcia.  I had to edit the catalog for the
      preference editor so the prefs window would fit on a 640x200 screen.
      My apologies to spanish ReqTools users if I made mistakes in doing so.
    German catalog file for preference editor fixed.
    Version 1.1a of RTPatch included.<P>

[1.3] - 38.1020 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Requesters with an inactive parent window will no longer open inactive.
      This new feature of ReqTools 2.1b was removed since it was more
      annoying than helpful.  Jorrit will be shot at dawn... ;-)
    Palette color spread function was broken in Kickstart 2.0 version of the
      library.  Fixed.  Thanks to Jesper Juul for reporting this bug.
    New danish catalogs and danish install text included (thanks Jesper).
    German catalog for library fixed, some keyboard shortcut keys were used
      twice.
    French catalog for preference editor included (thanks Benoit).<P>

<PRE>
    Major new feature: rexx interface to the library.  RexxReqTools is a
      small library that offers lots of rexx commands to use just about all
      ReqTools requesters.  Many thanks to Rafael D'Halleweyn for writing
      this library and giving me permission to include it with ReqTools.
    Finally fixed the refresh bug in the Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools.
      Seems it was a bug in the 3.00 ROM.  ReqTools now uses the 'bug-less'
      ScrollWindowRaster() for its window scrolling on 3.0.  Thank you
      Peter Cherna! :-)
    A small bug popped up in the rewriting of the string gadget edit hook
      (Kickstart 2.0 version of ReqTools): keyboard shortcuts were no
      longer possible from integer gadgets.  Fixed.
    Added extra message to install script.  Must still be translated for all
      languages except english and dutch.
    Fixed bug in 'reqtools.i'.  Missing rtfi_IntuiMsgFunc, rtfo_IntuiMsgFunc
      and rtsc_IntuiMsgFunc caused several offsets to be wrong.  Thanks to
      Dirk Vangestel for reporting this.
    Fixed bug in SAS/C and Manx C glue code.  Stubs for rtReqHandler() and
      rtReqHandlerA() didn't save the A6 register.
    Included assembly version of demo source (converted by Dirk Vangestel).
    Most glue code has been archived with LhA (not everyone needs all the
      glue code, just de-archive what you need).
    Fixed enforcer hit in ReqTools preference editor, version 2.1a included.
    Version 1.1b of RTPatch included.<P>

[1.3] - 38.1042 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Fixed bug in 'clib/reqtools_protos.h' include file: rtFontRequest() and
      rtScreenModeRequest() had wrong prototypes causing the ReqHandler
      feature to fail to work (without casting).  Thanks to Ebbe Holleris
      Petersen for reporting this problem.
    Fixed small problem in rtEZRequest() requester: if body text was too
      large to fit on the screen and was clipped you could not click on the
      requester's buttons.
    Fixed problem with leading '/' in paths entered in file string gadget.
    Fixed enforcer hits when typing in font requester size gadget.
    Fixed problem with first Shift Down in a file requester with less
      entries than are possibly visible selecting a non-existant entry.
    Fixed problem with typing a single '/' in the path gadget.  This caused
      the file requester to jump to the parent, but the path gadget was
      incorrectly cleared.
    Bug fix: palette requester didn't correctly restore the correct colors
      when it was canceled on an AGA machine with colors from a 24 bit
      palette.  Thanks to Felix Braun for reporting this.  Full AGA support
      will be something for the next release.
    Fixed bug in backfill code.  Didn't always clear window background
      properly on screens with more than 2 bitplanes.  Thanks to David Nouls
      for reporting this.
    Stack checking code in Kickstart 2.0 version of the library completely
      rewritten.  Now uses exec.library StackSwap() to swap the stack.
    Glue code for SAS/C enhanced.  Code hunks are now named 'text' instead
      of 'code', allowing real small code linking.  Glue code now supports
      the autoinitialization and autotermination feature of SAS/C 6.0.  If
      you define ReqToolsBase as external and link with reqtools.lib or
      reqtoolsnb.lib, reqtools.library will be automatically opened.
      Thanks to Brian Ipsen for the suggestion.
    Fixed small bug with rtSetWaitPointer() in HighSpeed Pascal interface.
    Portugese catalogs and install text for library and preference editor
      included.  Translated by Pedro Aguiar.
    Added 'Español' and 'Português' check boxes to languages in install
      script.
    German strings in install script updated by Steffen Salzmann.
    Swedish catalog for library adjusted a bit.
    GCC interface to the library included.  Written by Marc Duponcheel.
    Release 1.2b of RexxReqTools included.<P>

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.1f (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1095 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Screenmode requester now knows about EURO72, EURO36, SUPER72, DBLNTSC
      and DBLPAL monitors.
    rtGetVScreenSize() now uses VideoControl() if possible to get the
      visible screen size.
    File requester, font requester and screenmode requester now ignore
      all key presses before the requester is completely set up.  This
      should just about eliminate the problem of a gadget getting pressed
      because the user typed too quickly.
    File requester will use the device name of a volume if it's name is
      not unique (multiple floppies called 'Empty' for example).
    On Kickstart 3.0 or higher the file, font and screenmode requesters will
      use memory pools.
    Palette requester is now fully AGA compatible.  It uses the DisplayInfo
      database to find out the palette range of the screen it is opened on.
      It supports 256 colors out of a pallete of 16,8 million and should
      support even beyond that (not tested since there currently is nothing
      that goes beyond that :-).
    Bug fix: using the close gadget of the palette requester returned 0
      instead of -1 for cancel.
    Bug fix: rtGetLong() requester completely misplaced the min/max display
      when RTGL_TextFmt was used.
    Bug fix: fixed enforcer hits in file requester when FREQF_SELECTDIRS
      was used and a directory was double-clicked.
    Bug fix: font style handling of rtFontRequest() was almost completely
      broken.  Should work ok now.
    Bug fix: min/max display in rtGetLong() requester would become garbled
      during window-refreshing when the RT_ReqHandler feature was used.
    Bug fix: clearing the font name gadget in the rtFontRequest() requester
      and pressing Return caused the requester to return TRUE although
      the 'Cancel' gadget was visibly selected.  The requester now properly
      returns FALSE.
    Fixed some minor errors in include files and autodoc.
    Some updated catalogs included.
    French install text included, translated by Benoit Mortier.
    Release 1.2c of RexxReqTools included.
    Version 1.2 of RTPatch included.<P>

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.2 (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1194 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE: All changes listed below are for the Kickstart 2.0 and higher
          version of the library (unless stated otherwise).  Development of
          the 1.3 compatible version of ReqTools has more or less stopped.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    File, font and screenmode are now able to use proportional fonts, making
      them truly font-sensitive.  Palette requester will accept and use a
      proportional font on Kickstart 3.0 or higher only.  Note: this
      required a small catalog change, so be sure to update your catalogs.
    Added cool LED indicator left of the drawer gadget in the file requester.
      People who dislike this can turn this feature off in the ReqTools 2.2
      preference editor.
    File requester will now make sure 'freq-&gt;Dir' and 'filename' are
      up-to-date when a callback hook is called (RTFI_FilterFunc and
      RT_IntuiMsgFunc).  If you want to rely on this please check for
      this _exact_ release of ReqTools (or higher of course).
    File requester will show file sizes in localized form now.
    Screenmode requester now handles color depths greater than 8192 colors
      correctly (will use 16K, 32K, 16M,... for high color values).
      Previously the window borders could get overwritten, oops :-)
    Removed hardcoded monitor names from screenmode requester code and made
      screenmode requester construct the name for an unnamed mode from the
      monitor name and dimensions.
    Bug fix: when the SCREQF_GUIMODES flag is used the screenmode requester
      will no longer show modes that haven't got the DIPF_IS_WB flag set.
      This fixes the problem of truecolor Picasso II modes showing up.
    Added a temporary workaround for a SAS/C bug (6.50 and earlier) creating
      incorrect code for taglist switches.  Programs with a missing TAG_END
      in one of their taglists will no longer crash (but are still buggy ;-)
    Changed rtLockWindow() and rtUnlockWindow() nesting code.  Should work
      much better now and allow for infinite nesting.
    Improved calculation of spacing value in rtGetVScreenSize(), will now
      properly return a spacing of 4 for A2024 monitor for example.
    Release 1.2e of RexxReqTools included.
    Version 2.2 of ReqTools preference editor included.
    Version 1.3 of RTPatch included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.2a (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1210 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Bug fix: on Kickstart 3.0 (V39) the palette requester's slider values
      were sometimes incorrectly displayed (palette requester will now only
      use GTJ_RIGHT on V40 or higher).
    Bug fix: if no locale.library was found (Workbench 2.04) the file and
      font requesters would display a 'D' instead of the file/font size.
    Bug fix: rtSpread() now handles the case where the total size of all
      objects is larger than the total available size correctly (objects will
      overlap in this case of course).
    Quirk fix: file requester will no longer overlap the button gadgets when
      they get too wide for the screen (german locale and lores screen for
      example).  It will scale the buttons in size to make them fit.
    Screenmode requester will no longer fail silently if the current mode
      is invalid.  It now simply picks the first mode id from the current
      list of modes.
    Changed display mode filtering code slightly to fix the problem with
      Picasso II monitor 2.14 (or higher) modes not showing up in the
      screenmode requester.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.2b (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1248 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Bug fix: screenmode requester had some selection problems on certain
      graphic cards (Spectrum, Merlin,...).  Should be fixed now.
    Directory requester will no longer hide the files in directories, but
      will show them ghosted now.  Note that directories will always be
      shown first in the directory requester, regardless of the ReqTools
      prefs setting.
    File requester now has directory completion as well as filename
      completion.  Pressing Alt up/down arrow will select the directory
      that most closely matches the contents of the filename string gadget.
    The file requester now also has volume and assign completion.  Using
      up/down arrow will select the closest matching volume.  Use the Alt
      qualifier to select the closest matching assign.
    The volume list will now first show the volume name, followed by the
      device name.
    New switch in the ReqTools preference editor to force the use of the
      system default font instead of the screen font in the file, volume,
      font, screenmode and palette requesters.
    Fixed enforcer hits in font and screenmode requesters when an intuition
      callback function (RT_IntuiMsgFunc tag) was used.
    Improved method of filtering DOS devices that are shown in the file and
      volume requesters.
    Palette requester: pressing either Alt key with the keyboard shortcut
      for red, green or blue will adjust the color value in steps of 8.
    Fixed SAS/C glue code to be compatible again with the autoinitialization
      and autotermination feature of SAS/C 6.50 and higher.
    Added SAS/C 6.x 'tagcall' pragmas to 'include/pragmas/reqtools.h'.
    Included new glue code for GCC.  Written by Gunther Nikl.
    Version 2.2b of ReqTools preference editor included.<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.2c (Library version 38.390
[1.3] - 38.1266 [2.0])<P>
<PRE>
    Since using VideoControl() to get the visible display clip only seems
      to work when the screen in question is the frontmost screen the
      rtGetVScreenSize() function now falls back to using QueryOverscan()
      for screens that are in the back (thanks to Dietmar Eilert for
      reporting this).
    Changed method of filtering DOS devices that are shown in the file and
      volume requesters again.
    Window size and gadget layout is now calculated in a sysihack compatible
      way.
    Bug fix: screenmode requester should no longer &quot;lose&quot; characters in the
      color slider values on Kickstarts below V40 (3.1).
    Bug fix: fixed enforcer hits that occured when the screenmode requester
      came up with an empty list (all modes filtered out e.g.).
    Minor bug fix: backfill pattern in EZRequesters now uses BACKGROUNDPEN
      instead of pen 0.
    Polish catalogs for library and preference editor included.  Translated
      by Juan Carlos Marcin Orlowski.<P>

***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.3 (Library version 38.1292)<P>
<PRE>
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    NOTE: Update work made by Magnus Holmgren. See start of this file for
          more information.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------<P>

    Release 1.3 of RexxReqTools included.
    Recompiled using DICE 3.01. This was forced by the fact that I don't
      have SAS/C (yet, at lest). As a result, the library now is a couple
      of KBs larger.
    Bug fix: screenmode requester now works better when showing a depth
      gadget for HAM screens. Most notably, the requester will not crash
      under certain circumstances, and will also handle HAM modes with a
      depth of 8 (earlier, only depth 6 was supported). The HAM support was
      a kind of hack, which was incomplete. Its still a hack, but it is
      better now. ;)
    In the file requester, when displaying the volumes list, RMB acts like
      pressing the Get gadget. I.e., you can go back to the original list
      by a simple RMB click. The &quot;Volumes&quot; gadget also acts like Get, if
      pressed while the volume list is displayed.
    The resizable requesters now uses &quot;OS 3 zooming&quot;. I.e., the requester
      doesn't move (unless needed) when zoomed.
    Added zoom gadget for the palette requester. When zoomed, the
      requester resizes to &quot;titlebar&quot; size; again, using OS 3 zooming if
      possible.
    Updated the Swedish translation a little.
    In rtEZRequest, function keys can now be used to select the first ten
      gadgets, if enabled in the prefs editor.
    Added the 'Use function keys' option to the prefs program. Currently
      this is the only way to enable this function. In the future there
      will probably be a new tag/flag for this as well.
    Increased the stack some requester functions allocates, if needed.
      Should solve the crashing requesters with some programs when e.g.
      CyberGraphX is installed.
    Added missing tags to ReqTools.h (RTGL_CenterText and RTGS_CenterText).
    Fixed the prefs editor so that all gadgets are updated when new
      settings are loaded.
    Rewrote the DICE-C glue. Now includes autoopen code.
    New distribution layout. There are still two different archives, but
      the contents are different little:
      reqtools&lt;ver&gt;.lha is replaced with reqtools&lt;ver&gt;dev.lha, and contains
      only the developer files (glue, examples, includes and autodocs). The
      user archive (reqtools&lt;ver&gt;usr.lha) haven't changed.
    The filerequester (and the font- and screenmode requester as well) will
      now look better when the screen they open on have &quot;strange&quot; dri-pens.
    Support for OS 1.3 completely dropped. The 1.3 version of
      reqtools.library is no longer included.
    Made a minor change in the ASL patch in RTPatch, so that it returns
      errors more correctly (avoids annoying error requesters after having
      cancelled certain file requesters). I hope the reassemble didn't
      break anything. I haven't tested it much. ;)<P>
</PRE>
***************************************************************************** RELEASE 2.4 (Library version 38.1296)<P>
<PRE>
    As you may have noticed, a slightly different version numbering scheme
      have been adopted. I simply removed the letter extensions. ;)
    Fixed a problem in RTPatch, introduced in the re-assembly in 2.3. It
      would (often, but not always) print way too much text.
    Made some fixes to the installation script. I had forgot to change it.
      ;)
    Hopefully fixed the startup crash in the preferences editor.
    Included glue for Maxon Pascal, written by Falk Zuehlsdorff.
    rtEZRequestTags() was missing in new DICE glue.
    Fixed bug in password requester (used by powerpacker.library). DICE bug
      if you ask me. ;)
    French, Italian and Polish catalogs updated.<P>
