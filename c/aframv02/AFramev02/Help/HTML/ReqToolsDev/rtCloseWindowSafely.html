  NAME  rtCloseWindowSafely() [V38]<P>

    rtCloseWindowSafely (window);<P>

    void rtCloseWindowSafely (struct Window *);
                              A0<P>

  DESCRIPTION
    Closes a window which shares its IDCMP port with another window.  All the
    pending messages (concerning this window) on the port will be removed and
    the window will be closed.<P>

    Do not use this function to close windows which have an IDCMP port set up
    by Intuition.  If you do the port will be left in memory!<P>

    If you intend to open a lot of windows all sharing the same IDCMP port it
    is easiest if you create a port yourself and open all windows with
    newwin.IDCMPFlags set to 0 (this tells Intuition to NOT set up an IDCMP
    port).  After opening the window set the win-&gt;UserPort to your message
    port and call ModifyIDCMP() to set your IDCMP flags.<P>

    When you then receive messages from intuition check the imsg-&gt;IDCMPWindow
    field to find out what window they came from and act upon them.<P>

    When closing your windows call rtCloseWindowSafely() for all of them and
    delete your message port.  Easy peasy :-)<P>

    NOTE: Only call rtCloseWindowSafely() for windows with a shared IDCMP
          port.  Do *NOT* call it for windows with an IDCMP port created
          by Intuition!<P>

  INPUTS
    window - pointer to the window to be closed.<P>

  RESULT
    none<P>

  NOTE
    This function is for the advanced ReqTools user.<P>

  BUGS
    none known<P>
