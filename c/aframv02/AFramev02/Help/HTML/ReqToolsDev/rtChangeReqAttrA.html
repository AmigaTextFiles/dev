  NAME  rtChangeReqAttrA()<P>

    [long =] rtChangeReqAttrA (req, taglist);<P>

    [LONG] rtChangeReqAttrA (APTR, struct TagItem *);
                      A1    A0<P>

    [long =] rtChangeReqAttr (req, tag1,...);<P>

    [LONG] rtChangeReqAttr (APTR, Tag,...);<P>

  DESCRIPTION
    Change requester attributes with supplied taglist.  This is the only
    correct way to change the attributes listed below.<P>

    The return code from rtChangeReqAttrA() should be ignored unless stated
    otherwise.<P>

    Don't pass the tags listed below to the requester itself (unless
    documented otherwise).  They will not be recognized.<P>

  INPUTS
    req     - pointer to requester.
    taglist - pointer to array of tags.<P>

  TAGS
    for the file requester:
        RTFI_Dir         - (char *)
                           Name of new directory to position file requester
                           in. The requester's buffer will be deallocated.
        RTFI_MatchPat    - (char *)
                           New pattern string to match files on.
        RTFI_AddEntry    - (BPTR)
                           THIS *MUST* BE THE LAST TAG (just before TAG_END)!
                           Tagdata must hold a lock on a file or directory
                           you want to add to the file requester's buffer.
                           The lock should have been obtained using Lock(),
                           and you must unlock this lock yourself.
                           It is your responsibility to make sure the file
                           or directory is indeed in the directory the file
                           requester is in.
                           If the entry is already in the file requester's
                           buffer it will simply be updated.
                           It is harmless to use this tag if the requester's
                           buffer is not initialized. rtChangeReqAttr() will
                           return a boolean to indicate success or failure
                           (out of memory).
        RTFI_RemoveEntry - (char *)
                           Name of file or directory you want to remove from
                           the file requester's buffer.
                           It is your responsibility to make sure the file
                           or directory is indeed in the directory the file
                           requester is in.
                           It is harmless use this tag if the requester's
                           buffer is not initialized.
    for the font requester:
        RTFO_FontName    - (char *) 
                           Set the name of the currently selected font.
        RTFO_FontHeight  - (UWORD)
                           Set the fontsize of the currently selected font.
        RTFO_FontStyle   - (UBYTE)
                           Set the style of the current font.
        RTFO_FontFlags   - (UBYTE)
                           Set the flags of the current font.
    for the screenmode requester [V38]:
        RTSC_ModeFromScreen - (struct Screen *)
                              Screen to get mode attributes from.
                              NOTE: You must make sure the mode this screen
                                    is in will be accepted by the screen
                                    mode requester.  Otherwise it will auto-
                                    matically cancel.  For example, you use
                                    RTDI_ModeFromScreen on a HAM screen and
                                    you haven't set the SCREQF_NONSTDMODES
                                    flag.
                              Note that you must use this tag _before_ the
                              four tags below because this tag will set the
                              width, height, depth and autoscroll.
        RTSC_DisplayID      - (ULONG)
                              Set 32-bit mode id of selected mode.  The width
                              and height will be set to the default (visible)
                              width and height, and the depth will be set to
                              maximum.  Also read note above.  Note that you
                              must use this tag _before_ the three tags below
                              because this tag will set the width, height and
                              depth to default values.
        RTSC_DisplayWidth   - (UWORD)
                              Set width of display.  Must come after
                              RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.
        RTSC_DisplayHeight  - (UWORD)
                              Set height of display.  Must come after
                              RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.
        RTSC_DisplayDepth   - (UWORD)
                              Set depth of display.  Must come after
                              RTSC_DisplayID or RTSC_ModeFromScreen tags.
        RTSC_AutoScroll     - (BOOL)
                              Boolean state of autoscroll checkbox.
                              Must come after RTSC_ModeFromScreen tag.
        RTSC_OverscanType   - (ULONG)
                              Set type of overscan.  Set to 0 for regular
                              size, otherwise use OSCAN_... constants.
