The Future<P>
<PRE>
   This release is only a minor update, so I've tried to keep things as they were. I don't intend to make any major</PRE>
work to the current sources (maybe some minor updates and bug fixes), as my intention is to make a (more or less)
complete rewrite of ReqTools. I have the famous TODO file <A href=Contacting the author.html>Nico</A> maintained, and I'll try to add any useful
suggestions found therein. There are also some other nice features planned, like e.g. an API (so that the
application - or external &quot;modules&quot; - can extent ReqTools). Exact details have not yet been worked out.<P>
<PRE>
   If you have a suggestion you don't think is in the TODO file, feel free to tell me about it.
