Using reqtools.library<P>
<PRE>
   If you are a C programmer all you need to do is include the correct header ('libraries/reqtool.h') and open</PRE>
reqtools.library. After that you can use the functions in the library as if they were C functions. If your program
quits it must of course close the library again. See 'demo.c' for an example.<P>
<PRE>
   Glue code for several compilers/languages is included with ReqTools 2.4. Look in the Glue directory of the</PRE>
ReqTools distribution to see if glue code exists for your compiler and/or programming language.  If it doesn't and
you write your own please send it to me and I'll include it in the next release of ReqTools.<PRE>
   Note that the source for the Manx C libraries is the same as for the <A href=SAS C.html>SAS/C</A> libraries.  See the README.Manx file</PRE>
in the archive 'Glue/Sas-C/LibSource.lha'.<PRE>
   Manx C users may have to edit '<A href=<libraries/reqtools.h>.html>libraries/reqtools.h</A>' and change the library (GfxBase, IntuitionBase, etc.) fields</PRE>
to rt_GfxBase, rt_IntuitionBase etc. Seems there is a bug in some versions of the Manx C compiler that has problems
otherwise.  Let's hope this gets fixed soon :-)<P>
<PRE>
   Functions allowing a variable number of arguments can't be called using pragmas (in-line library calls, no glue</PRE>
code required).  So if you use these you must always link with LIB:reqtools.lib or LIB:reqtoolsnb.lib (for SAS-C, or
with the specific libraries for your compiler/language).<P>
<PRE>
   Assembly programmers should also include the correct files and open reqtools.library.  To call a function they</PRE>
must load A6 with the library base, put the arguments in the appropriate registers and jump to the library vector
offset of the function they want to call.<P>
<PRE>
   Remember to open the library with a specific version number if you wish to use features only found in that</PRE>
version (for example: screen mode requester).<P>
<PRE>
   All library functions are explained in the autodoc file 'reqtools.doc'.<P>

                                                       Enjoy.
