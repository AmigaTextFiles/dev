  NAME  rtSetReqPosition()<P>

    rtSetReqPosition (reqpos, newwindow, screen, window);<P>

    void rtSetReqPosition
               (ULONG, struct NewWindow *, struct Screen *, struct Window *);
                D0     A0                  A1               A2<P>

  DESCRIPTION
    Sets newwindow-&gt;LeftEdge and newwindow-&gt;TopEdge according to reqpos.<P>

    Except for the left- and topedge 'newwindow' must already be completely
    initialized.<P>

    The newwindow-&gt;LeftEdge and newwindow-&gt;TopEdge already in the NewWindow
    structure will be used as offsets to the requested position.  If you'd
    like a window at position (25,18) from the top left of the screen you
    would fill newwindow-&gt;LeftEdge with 25, newwindow-&gt;TopEdge with 18 and
    call rtSetReqPosition() with reqpos equal to REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR.<P>

    Don't forget to make sure newwindow-&gt;LeftEdge and newwindow-&gt;TopEdge
    are 0 if you don't want to offset your window.<P>

    In case of REQPOS_POINTER you can use them to point to your window's
    hotspot, where the pointer should point.  If you call rtSetReqPosition()
    with the left- and topedge equal to 0 you'd get a window appearing with
    its top- and leftedge equal to the current pointer position.<P>

    Note that the screen pointer may _NOT_ be NULL.  If you have your own
    window open you can supply yourwindow-&gt;WScreen to this function.<P>

    The window pointer is only required if reqpos is REQPOS_CENTERWIN or
    REQPOS_TOPLEFTWIN.  Even in this case you may call rtSetReqPosition()
    with a NULL window pointer.  The positions will simply fall back to
    REQPOS_CENTERSCR and REQPOS_TOPLEFTSCR respectively.<P>

  INPUTS
    reqpos    - one of the REQPOS_... constants usable with RT_ReqPos.
    newwindow - pointer to your (already initialized) NewWindow structure.
    screen    - pointer to screen the requester will appear on.
    window    - pointer to parent window or NULL.<P>

  RESULT
    none<P>

  NOTE
    This function is for the advanced ReqTools user.<P>

  BUGS
