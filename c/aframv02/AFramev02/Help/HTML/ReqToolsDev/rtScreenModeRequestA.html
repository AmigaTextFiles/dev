  DESCRIPTION<P>

    *IMPORTANT* THIS REQUESTER IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM KICKSTART 2.0 ONWARDS!
                The 1.3 version of ReqTools also contains the screenmode
                requester, but unless you are running 2.0 or higher it will
                not come up.  So what you essentially have to do is NOT
                call rtScreenModeRequestA() if your program is running on
                a machine with Kickstart 1.2/1.3.  You can safely call
                rtScreenModeRequestA() if you are running on a 2.0 machine,
                even if the user has installed the 1.3 version of ReqTools.<P>

    Get a screen mode from the user.<P>

    The user will be able to pick a screen mode by name, enter the size and
    the number of colors (bitplane depth).<P>

    rtScreenModeRequestA() will call the appropriate 2.0 functions to get all
    the mode's information.  If no name has been assigned to the mode one
    will be constructed automatically.<P>

  INPUTS
    screenmodereq - pointer to a struct rtScreenModeRequester allocated with
                    <A href=rtAllocRequestA.html>rtAllocRequestA()</A>.
    title         - pointer to requester window title (null terminated).
    taglist       - pointer to a TagItem array.<P>

    RT_IntuiMsgFunc    - (struct Hook *) [V38]
                         The requester will call this hook for each IDCMP
                         message it gets that doesn't belong to its window.
                         Only applies if you used the RT_ShareIDCMP tag to
                         share the IDCMP port with the parent window.
                         Parameters are as follows:
                           A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                           A2 - (struct rtScreenModeRequester *) your req
                           A1 - (struct IntuiMessage *) the message
                         After you have finished examining the message and
                         your hook returns, ReqTools will reply the message.
                         So do not reply the message yourself!
    RT_Underscore      - (char) [V38]
                         Indicates the symbol that precedes the character in
                         a gadget's label to be underscored.  This will also
                         define the keyboard shortcut for this gadget.
                         Currently only needed for RTSC_OkText.  Usually set
                         to '_'.
    RT_DefaultFont     - (struct TextFont *)
                         This tag allows you to specify the font to be used
                         in the requester when the screen font is
                         proportional.  Default is GfxBase-&gt;DefaultFont.
                         This tag is obsolete in ReqTools 2.2 and higher.
    RT_TextAttr        - [V38] see <A href=rtFileRequestA.html>rtFileRequestA()</A>
    RTSC_Flags         - (ULONG)
                         Several flags:
                           SCREQF_OVERSCANGAD   - Add an overscan cycle
                                                  gadget to the requester.
                                                  After the requester returns
                                                  you may read the overscan
                                                  type in 'rq-&gt;OverscanType'
                                                  If this is 0 no overscan is
                                                  selected (Regular Size), if
                                                  non-zero it holds one of
                                                  the OSCAN_... values
                                                  defined in the include file
                                                  'intuition/screens.[h|i]'.
                           SCREQF_AUTOSCROLLGAD - Add an autoscroll checkbox
                                                  gadget to the requester.
                                                  After the requester returns
                                                  read 'smreq-&gt;AutoScroll' to
                                                  see if the user prefers
                                                  autoscroll to be on or off.
                           SCREQF_SIZEGADS      - Add width and height
                                                  gadgets to the requester.
                                                  If you do not add these
                                                  gadgets the width and
                                                  height returned will be the
                                                  default width and height
                                                  for the selected overscan
                                                  type.
                           SCREQF_DEPTHGAD      - Add a depth slider gadget
                                                  to the requester.  If you
                                                  do not add a depth gadget,
                                                  the depth returned will be
                                                  the maximum depth this mode
                                                  can be opened in.
                           SCREQF_NONSTDMODES   - Include all modes. Unless
                                                  this flag is set
                                                  rtScreenModeRequestA()
                                                  will exclude nonstandard
                                                  modes.  Nonstandard modes
                                                  are presently HAM and EHB
                                                  (ExtraHalfBrite). So unless
                                                  you are picking a mode to
                                                  do some rendering in leave
                                                  this flag unset.  Without
                                                  this flag set the mode
                                                  returned will be a normal
                                                  bitplaned mode.
                           SCREQF_GUIMODES      - Set this flag if you are
                                                  getting a screen mode to
                                                  open a user interface
                                                  screen in.  The modes
                                                  shown will be standard
                                                  modes with a high enough
                                                  resolution (minumum 640
                                                  pixels).  If this flag is
                                                  set the SCREQF_NONSTDMODES
                                                  flag is ignored.
    RTSC_Height        - (ULONG)
                         Suggested height of screenmode requester window.
    RTSC_OkText        - (char *)
                         Replacement text for &quot;Ok&quot; gadget, max 6 chars long.
    RTSC_MinWidth      - (UWORD)
                         The minimum display width allowed.
    RTSC_MaxWidth      - (UWORD)
                         The maximum display width allowed.
    RTSC_MinHeight     - (UWORD)
                         The minimum display height allowed.
    RTSC_MaxHeight     - (UWORD)
                         The maximum display height allowed.
    RTSC_MinDepth      - (UWORD)
                         The minimum display depth allowed.  Modes with a
                         minimum display depth lower than this value will not
                         be included in the list.
    RTSC_MaxDepth      - (UWORD)
                         The maximum display depth allowed.
    RTSC_PropertyFlags - (ULONG)
                         A mode must have these property flags to be
                         included.  Only bits set in RTSC_PropertyMask are
                         considered.
    RTSC_PropertyMask  - (ULONG)
                         Mask to apply to RTSC_PropertyFlags to determine
                         which bits to consider.  See use of 'newsignals' and
                         'signalmask' in exec.library/SetSignal().  Default
                         is to consider all bits in RTSC_PropertyFlags as
                         significant.
    RTSC_FilterFunc    - (struct Hook *)
                         Call this hook for each display mode id in the
                         system's list.
                         Parameters are as follows:
                           A0 - (struct Hook *) your hook
                           A2 - (struct rtScreenModeRequester *) your req
                           A1 - (ULONG) 32-bit extended mode id
                         If your hook returns TRUE the mode will be accepted.
                         If it returns FALSE the mode will be skipped and
                         will not appear in the requester.<P>

  RESULT
    ret - FALSE if the requester was canceled or TRUE if the user selected a
          screen mode (check 'smreq-&gt;DisplayID' for the 32-bit extended
          display mode, 'smreq-&gt;DisplayWidth' and 'smreq-&gt;DisplayHeight' for
          the display size, 'smreq-&gt;DisplayDepth' for the screen's depth).<P>

  NOTE
    Automatically adjusts the requester to the screen font.<P>

    If the requester got too big for the screen because of a very large font,
    the topaz.font will be used.<P>

    rtScreenModeRequest() checks the <A href=pr_WindowPtr.html>pr_WindowPtr</A> of your process to find the
    screen to put the requester on.<P>

  BUGS
    none known<P>
