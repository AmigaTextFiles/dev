Commercial usage is allowed if the following conditions are met:<P>

Freely Distibutable Products<P>
<PRE>
  All of the files copyrighted by the authors must remain unmodified.  None of these files may be distributed on its</PRE>
own, the entire package must be distributed as one whole.  'demo.cpp' is full public domain and can be used in any
way you like.<P>
<PRE>
  There is one exception to the above.  If you plan to release a freely distributable program (either public domain,</PRE>
freeware or shareware), you may include 'libs/aframe.library', the installation scripts (with icon), the
documentation (with icons) with your distribution.<P>

If you include AFrame with a crippled shareware program I'd like to ask you to send us a full working version.<P>
