copying costs. AFrame is distributed as non-crippled shareware, it is fully functional.

Commercial Distribution

Commercial usage is allowed if the following conditions are met:

    a) You state in your documentation that your program uses aframe.library
       and that AFrame is Copyright (c) Jeff Worth and Deryk Robosson.

    b) You send us a copy of your finished product(s) using aframe.library.

  If these conditions are met you are allowed to include the Kickstart 2.0 or higher version of aframe.library and

  There is one exception to the above.  If you plan to release a freely distributable program (either public domain,
freeware or shareware), you may include 'libs/aframe.library', the installation scripts (with icon), the
documentation (with icons) with your distribution.

If you include AFrame with a crippled shareware program I'd like to ask you to send us a full working version.
