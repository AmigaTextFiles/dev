If you are using Aztec-C I would just tell you to look in the
bin drawer for an executable called "lb"  it is the librarian.
But since I don't know what system you are using,  
I can't give more specific advice than what I have.... 

This setup may be applicable to other environments too
so I will elaborate incase it can be usefull...

Compile the source as usual with:   
usage:     *cc  path:sourcefile.c*

That generates the  .o   file,  then use the librarian. 

usage:    * lb  path:libname.lib   -v  -a+   path:objectfile.o*

That will add that particular object module to the library.
Be carefull what order you put them in, incase one function calls
another one in the same library...

The lowest level functions, go in last.

Oh, sorry, I thought the original poster was trying to change the taskname 
of one started with a system() command.

To give a task a name just use amiga.lib/CreateTask() or for a DOS Process 
use the NP_Name tag.

I am using the featureless and manual-less HiSoft C++ so I have no "lb" 
tool.  Although it does generate #?.o files (woopee) so I'll look on Aminet 
and see if there is some tool that'll do it.

My particular LB  is designed for my linker & I believe it is
also compatible with the lattice compiler system linker,
so if you want to try it, I can send you (privately) my LB & 
a sample script & options doc for you to try & see if your 
particular linker likes it... ??

Try this Code:

The System() function accepts a command line argument.  You get exactly the 
same as you would typing it in a shell window.

So the general concensus is that it`s ok to task=FindTask(NULL) then
strcpy(task->tc_Node.ln_Name,"newname"); as long as newname is shorter than
the old name. Or should I just use

const char newName[]="newname"; 
char *oldName=task->tc_Node.ln_Name;
task->tc_Node.ln_Name=newName;
...
...
task->tc_Node.ln_Name=oldName;

Is any of this legal or is it all a horrid hack?

Create task will not do as I need DOS.
LoadSegList and CreateNewProc is probably the solution. Bit of convolution
though.
I`ve opted for the nasty hack ATM. I`ll probly try the above soon.

It's the only way to change task name in AmigaOS... Authors forgot about

No, *definately not,*  the old one may even be NULL... 

*  pr_Task->tc_Node.ln_Name*
is a  (char *)  pointer to a name string.....   
It is *NOT* the address of the name string.

Do not use  strcpy() ,  just change the pointer,
but make sure you restore it before exit().

I hadn`t thought of that. I did check the length with strlen() to make sure
the new name would fit and exited otherwise but strlen() would guru on a NULL
presumably.

Yes. I`ll change it.

Well, basically they would do extactly the same thing( those hacks) So what
is the point of these functions other than to simplify  things to the user.

This is correct. The reason for drawing into the buffer instead of direct to
the screen is to prevent flicker. Bitmaps can be held in fast-ram, but there
will be a very noticeable slowdown.

But surely fast ram is better because the CPU can access this a *lot* faster?

Yes, but when using the gfxboards native memory, the on-board
blitter can directly access the buffer, and blitting is almost
instantaneous. This is not the case when rendering in fast-ram.

The problem with the CyberGraphX software of today is that it
doesn't allow for bitmaps in video memory that doesn't need to
be locked in place, and when locking them, you need to be fast
on updates. Using the MMU (through mmu.library preferably),
the video-memory could be made completely virtual for the user.
If the bitmap is swapped into fast-ram, this is made transparent
to the user, and thanks to access-flags in the mmu-tables,
refreshes would be quite easy to process.

Only problem with this approach is that the computer needs an
MMU, but we can't have an "everybody wins" solution.

(I have never used Picasso96, so I can't say anything about it)

atof() is part of the standard C library, just include stdlib.h and
there shouldn't be any problems. If StormC lacks atof(), get a new
compiler. :)

atof should take an ascii string and return a double (faux ami :)
Dunna stormC, but if you don't have atof, you might use sscanf like that:

double my_atof( char *s )
{
 double res=0.0;
  
 sscanf( s, "%lf", &res );
 return res;
}

or eventually check if you've got a strtod function..

Hope it helps.

 Phil.

yes, but if you must dump your 640*480 buffer in the video memory all the time it could be far more
faster to directly do all your work in the vram
ie: Napalm is very very slow

 You need to allocate memory for your FileInfoBlock. Right now your code
will trash memory.

BTW, this can be done with AllocDosObject() - e.g.

  file_info = AllocDosObject(DOS_FIB,NULL);

This will also ensure that the memory is aligned correctly.

Alternatively, I know that DICE (and I presume SAS/C does too) supports
the __aligned attribute, which you could use instead - e.g.

  __aligned struct FileInfoBlock file_info;  // note, this isn't a pointer

And use ExamineFH(fh,&file_info).

Subject: @{b}ExamineFH() Problems@{ub}

Hello

I am currently writing a routine to read a file (currently fixed to
s:shell-startup just for testing purposes) and get its size so that I can
allocate a buffer to hold this text in.

Now, I understand you have to use ExamineFH() from the dos.library; and
indeed it works - except that when i click on to my program's window or
anywhere else for that matter - the computer completely freezes up requiring
a reboot.

I understand that the FileInfoBlock structure has to be longword aligned and
I think this is where my problem lies; however - i don't know how to do
this, as using say: file_info=1L<<file_info does not work in SAS/C 6.57 :) 
It probably wouldn't work anyway since i'm not totally 'au fait' with bit
shifting and such like.

I have *attached* the code segment.

It is becoming very aggrevating because I have to know the file's size so
that the correct amount of memory is allocated.

Thanks in advance.

All the best,

Nick.

It sure is the problem,  at the moment the FileInfoBlock pointer is
not initialized to point to the storage area.
(Which you havn't allocated anyway)

PS:   Remember, all dos structures require longword alignment.

-snip-

Here is a macro I employ to use temporary stack storage
for these sort of  situations & longword align it..


Note:  allocation MUST be at least 4 bytes bigger than you need.
          because alignment rounds up to next longword.


#define LALIGN(x)     ((x+3L)&0xFFFFFFFCL)


AUTO UBYTE fbuffer[  sizeof(struct FileInfoBlock) + 4L ];
STRUCT FileInfoBlock *fib;

   fib = LALIGN ( fbuffer );

   Examine(lock, fib);

Here is a macro I use for aligning structures on long words.. 
should work with any decent compiler. 
Notice that it wastes 3 octets for each object it allocates on the stack.

#define DCLEVNEVN( T, N ) char blk##N[3+sizeof(T)]; \
  T *N = (T *)((((unsigned long)(blk##N+3)/4)*4));
  
  
You use it in the declaration part of the block this way:

in place of 
struct FileInfoBlock *fib;
do
DCLEVNEVN( struct FileInfoBlock , fib );  


Hope it helps.

 Phil.

Hi Nick,

ok, lets see, you did:

struct FileInfoBlock *file_info;

so you define a pointer to a FileInfoBlock, but currently
it's pointing nowhere, so you need to allocate the memory:

file_info = (struct FileInfoBlock *) 
AllocMem(sizeof(struct FileInfoBlock),MEMF_CLEAR);
if (file_info) {...} // you MUST check for success here!

This will reserve the required longword aligned memory, which is
initiated by ExamineFH (and don't forget to Free() it afterwards).

If you just need the size of the file you also can do it another way.
As you already opened the file, just Seek() to the end to get the position
of the last byte, which also represents the size of the file. Looks like
this:

Seek(fh, 0, OFFSET_END)  // move to end of file
file_size=Seek(fh, 0, OFFSET_BEGINNING); 

returns the Position, where the Filecursor was before Seek was called. 
So this would store the position of the line above and move the Filecursor 
back to the beginning of the file. Seek() returns -1 in case of error 

Seek() is part of dos.h, and AllocMem() is part of exec.h, so don't forget 
to include those.

As I said, AllocDosObject(DOS_FIB,NULL) should really be used instead of
AllocMem() in this case.

Hello,

My problem is this - I want to convert a picture file into a blittable tile
object. The most obvious way seems to be to use datatypes, but I'm having
some problems. The following code

    bm->object = NewDTObject(filename,
                                    DTA_SourceType, DTST_FILE,
                                    TAG_DONE,                0);
    if (bm->object == NULL) { free(bm); return(NULL); }

    GetDTAttrs(bm->object,
                PDTA_BitMap, &bm->bitmap,
                DTA_NominalHoriz,    &bm->w,
                DTA_NominalVert,    &bm->h,
                TAG_DONE);

Does not give me a bitmap pointer, only NULL. Width and height are set
correctly. Presumably I am using it wrongly, can anyone set me right?

Another thing, the function DrawDTObject appears in the 3.5 autodocs, but
nowhere in the includes, is there a fix for this?

OK, ignore me, I found out why it was happening.

The problem was I was making id have values such as normal numbers, 
such as 1, 2, etc, and it has to be a value made up from 4 letters, 
using the MAKE_ID macro. Its not made clear this *must* be the case
in 
the RKRM's (or at least, thats my excuse :).

Hmm, one of those appropriate taglines I think.

   Don't do this :-)  Although it looks a nice idea, try it on a 750mb CD

   The above is what I use, works like a charm.  I use AllocVec rather than
AllocDosObject, don't ask me why :-)

   Don't do this :-)  Although it looks a nice idea, try it on a 750mb CD
image file :-)

This looks just the ticket, thanks. Which reminds me of a thought I had -
perhaps we could get a web-based "source despository" together, which
contains example sources like these? I know there are mailing list archives,
but I think this might be a bit more useful.

From: Nick Lamburn <oruk_amigan@btinternet.com>

Subject: @{b}TextEditor MUI Class Problem@{ub}

Hello

I decided to take a look at the TextEditor MCC for MUI today, and firstly i
wanted to compile the example file.  I'm using SAS/C 6.58 and have all MUI
includes installed properly.  (Since other MUI apps have compiled fine) 
However I get errors such as incorrect usage of reserved names like __a1 -
these are obviously CPU registers.  

I cannot figure out how to solve this and i was wondering if anyone could
'fix' it so it will compile with SAS/C 6.5.

I've attached the code here.  You might decry laziness but this is outside
my knowledge and i'm stumped! :)

BTW: Thanks to all those who helped with the FileinfoBlock problem, it now
works a treat, thank you all :)

All the best,

Nick.

As EGroups support file-areas for mailing-lists, this shouldn't be

Seek()  has always been the "pseudo official"  way to find just 
the file size,  ever since whenever....
All it does is move the cursor pointer,  nothing else... 

If you have a drive full of 750Mb  files, then you deserve it.    (:/

But if you ONLY want the file size,  it certainly has very low code overhead.
*AND*...    it is perfectly safe & needs no memory allocations.

However, If you need more information than the file size,
or intend Seek()ing  the crap out of an entrire directory of files,
or have a drive full of 750Mb  files,
then most certainly use Examine()....

For the:   "/check_my_size_while_I_have_it_open/"    situation,
Seek()  wins hands down....

   I guess, off the to of my head I can't think what the return type of<<
is, if there is one, but I think it would be done as?

rettype myprintclass :: operator << ( const char* &rhs ) const
{
    out( rhs );
}

rettype myprintclass :: operator << ( const int &rhs ) const
{
    out( rhs );
}

   Is that what you mean?  All you need to do is override the << operator
for all the different types you want.

Kind regards...

Yeah.. you have 2 options; you can either use istream and ostream as base 
classes and take advantage of their ready-made processing methods like 
get(), putback(), etc.  But since most compilers implement their streams 
very differently this might be quite difficult.  If you really want to do it 
this way, try looking in fstream.h for a helping hand - this contains 
ifstream and ofstream which are themselves sub-classes of istream and 
ostream.

The other option is to do write a new class which could look something like 
this:

class TelnetStream
{
public:
   Telnet();
   Telnet(char*); // create an object and connect straight away
   ~Telnet();
   open(char*);
   get(char&);   // like its istream equiv
   getline(char*)  // "      "
   put(char&);   // like its ostream equiv
   putline(char*); // "   "
private:
// private stuff
};


You will have to write all the socket I/O stuff and the code to do with the 
telnet protocol yourself, but that isn't too hard, and most often you don't 
need much of the fancy telnet codes anyway (there are 8 or 9 RFC's on 
various telnet extensions), I wrote a telnet-talker server which happily 
just sends plain text.  In the private section you would probably have a 
socket descriptor.  If you wanted it to be really polished then you could 
overload getline() to ">>" and putline() to "<<".

Please throw away that code! It's crappy and contains at least two bugs,
plus is written especially for StormC, it was my third C-source,

the TextEditor.mcc class (during it's development), which have made it

Attached example opens a window with a texteditor object and a button.

If you press the button, the texteditor will be cleared.

If you exit, and have changed the text, it'll be written to stdout.

I don't think it gets much simpler than that...

A little challenge: add a HTMLview-object and setup a notify between the
editor and this, then you actually have a quite neat HTML-editor, made
in less than 80 lines of code ;-)

Thanks heaps Allan,  that is the sort of thing I/we need,
to get going with.
Unfortunately these days,  with OO,  everyone assumes that 
everybody has an existing knowledge base & writes as such.

Not quite, operators have implicit return types, so you cannot declare
or define them with any return-type (not even void).

Now this is a *brilliant* idea.  I'm sure loads of people on this list
have some sort of 'pet' routine they'd like to pledge.

It could turn into a sort of Amiga-specific LEDA!

Depending on how many bits of source are contributed, it'll need careful
organisation though

Hi Allan,  thanks again for the example, however, I am having
the devils own time trying to get it to compile.

After spending the entire day getting setup properly by
downloading all the MUI developer archives to resolve 
the missing include files, & finding the aztec  mui.lib version
and converting the appropriate  include:protos/  to the
right syntax  to keep everything happy,

I finally managed to get it to compile & assemble without errors.

However,  linking is another story,   I cannot resolve the 
symbols:  DoMethod()   &   MUI_MakeObject()

I have looked in all the FD files for the  prototypes & checked
what lib sources I have to find the stub code,  I cannot
find those.   I have found other variants like:  DoGadgetMethod()
but I cant find:   DoMethod()  &  MUI_MakeObject().

Could you or anyone else supply the stub routines or
prototype info for these calls please.....

DoMethod() call is in the amigalib.  For StormC at least you just
include the clib/amigalib.h or something like that name (this is just
off the top of my head).

This will probably work:

ULONG DoMethod (Object *obj, ULONG methodID, ...)
{
   return DoMethodA(obj, (Msg)&methodID);
}

Object *MUI_MakeObject (ULONG objType, ULONG firstParam, ...)
{
   return MUI_MakeObjectA(objType, &firstParam);
}

Though the latter should be done by the compiler, by using "#pragma
tagcall" in the appropriate pragma file. And the former is a function
of amiga.lib, it's prototyped in "clib/alib_protos.h".

OOps,  I made an error in my previous mail,
I said:   "protos"  but I meant  "pragmas"  .....

In amigalib.h  the template is there,  here it is:

  ULONG DoMethodA( Object *obj, Msg message );
  ULONG DoMethod( Object *obj, unsigned long MethodID, ... );

but I need the *stub* routine or *pragma* definition to compile it,
as an example, like this call in gadtools for GT_BeginRefresh()..

  #pragma amicall(GadToolsBase, 0x5a, GT_BeginRefresh(a0))

There is no pragma file in /pragmas or any FD file for amiga.lib  
in my collection,   do you have one by chance ?

All that is my clib/alib.protos  is:
 
  ULONG DoMethodA( Object *obj, Msg message );
  ULONG DoMethod( Object *obj, ULONG methodID, ... );

Those are not pragmas as far as I understand,
they are function prototypes/declarations/templates....

I need the actual  pragma or the stub routine for the function,  
like this example:    #pragma amicall(AslBase, 0x3c, AslRequest(a0,a1))
or better still, 
the ASM stub that I can add to my linker library:   amiga.lib.


Any suggestions ??

I'm sorry, but I don't really understand exactly what you mean
when you say they are stored as macros...
Is the # pragma  definition what you call a macro ??

What I need is the stub code for the rom call DoMethod()  
in  whatever library it is in....  (intuition ??) 
and  MUI_MakeObject() as it appears not to be in  mui.lib.

The only way I know of resolving these linker symbol is to
provide a stub to link to the object code,  although in the
last week or so, I understand  (mostly)  that the compiler
can automatically generate the ROM entry point by using 
a  # pragma  definition of the ROM jump instead of 
having the stub in a linkable library..  (Just read about them)

I am using the Aztec 5.2 compiler &  the  "amiga.lib"  
on the dev cd's are not compatible anymore,  
so I have always had to build my own after about WB1.3 days.

To do this, I need the stub code,  which I can simply make from
the FD files supplied on the CD,  
but this function is not in any of them.

As this is the very first time I have ever done any of this OO stuff
I have not  needed a stub for these functions,  
so that is why they are unresolved.

For GCC these calls are stored as macros [1] in the appropriate proto file.
They're generated form the fd/clib files by fd2inline.

[1] this method is less than ideal and can cause problems, especially with
MUI.  I got around this by sticking MUI_MakeObject() in a .lib and
commenting out the sections in inline/muimaster.h.

I was talking about GCC (I didn't know what compiler you used).  AFAIK GCC
doesn't use #pragmas.

DoMethod() and DoMethodA() are both in amiga.lib.

Aztec..Never used it, sorry.  Doesn't MUI come with Aztec support?

In my 'pragmas/muimaster_pragmas.h' it mentions SAS & Aztec only.

Actually I think the problem isn't OO related rather Tag related.
Functions that end in 'A' usually take their parameters as a TagList.  For
example in MUI it's common to build the entire GUI with 1 call and 100s of
parameters.

DoMethod() is not a rom call. It's simply shorthand notation for
CallHook(OCLASS(obj)->cl_Dispatcher, obj, msg).

> in  whatever library it is in....  (intuition ??) 
> and  MUI_MakeObject() as it appears not to be in  mui.lib.

MUI_MakeObjectA() is in muimaster.library, but MUI_MakeObject() is the
variable-length argument variant, which is normally just generated by
the compiler.

This is similar to OpenWindowTagList(), which takes a pointer to a
Window structure and a *pointer* to a taglist, where OpenWindowTags()
receives the taglist on the stack.

Look in your intuition-pragma-file, here you'll find something like
this:

#pragma amicall(IntuitionBase, 0x25e, OpenWindowTagList(a0,a1))
#pragma tagcall(IntuitionBase, 0x25e, OpenWindowTags(a0,a1))

As you can see, the first indicates a library call, the second indicates
to the compiler, that the second argument should be a pointer to
something "build on the stack".

The code I posted (for DoMethod() and MUI_MakeObject()) should function
as stubs, so simply add these two functions to your source, and your
program should compile!  It's not ideal, because they rely on
parameters being passed on the stack (which they are) and as said, your
compiler should be able to do it, but I don't know Aztec...  I don't
understand why you don't just change compiler, because during startup
you don't want to struggle with problems caused by an outdated compiler
-- when you master C, AmigaOS, OOP etc. then you can go back and fight
these problems... ;-)

Var-args functions have nothing to do with OO.

I found the varargs stub in the archive,   mui/Dlib/MakeObj.c  file.
This resolved the first symbol ok...

Object *MUI_MakeObject(LONG type, ...)
{
    return(MUI_MakeObjectA(type, (ULONG *)(((ULONG)&type)+4)));
}

My compiler will build the varargs version just fine,  it is totally 
ansi complient & handles all the new stuff ok,  it just needs the info,
the  # pragma  entry,  or this code shown above,  
but I must be missing something from the MUI archive, 
because I can only find this in an  "inline"  file  from it.

Object *MUI_MakeObjectA( LONG type, ULONG *params)
{
  BASE_EXT_DECL
  register Object* res __asm("d0");
  register struct Library* a6 __asm("a6") = BASE_NAME;
  register LONG d0 __asm("d0")=type;
  register ULONG* a0 __asm("a0")=params;

  __asm volatile ("
  jsr a6@(-0x78)"
  : "=r" (res)
  : "r" (a6), "r" (d0), "r" (a0)
  : "d0", "d1", "a0", "a1" );
  return res;
}

It's some sort of wierd inline half asm code that didn't get included 
as a header file or a # pragma....

I managed to figure it out & built this out of it:

#asm
    xref    _MUIMasterBase
    public    _MUI_MakeObjectA
_MUI_MakeObjectA:
    MOVE.L    _MUIMasterBase,a6
    MOVE.L    4(sp),d0
    LEA    8(sp),a0
    JSR    -$78(A6)
    RTS
#endasm

That fixed the missing reference...    
However, I would be interested in finding out exactly where 
your compiler gets to know about MUIMakeObjectA()
because it is not in the mui.lib I have, or in any header files
that were included.

My mui.lib = 2304 bytes,  in the archive  "mui38dev.lha"
at path:    MUI/developer/C/Manx/mui.lib

There is really nothing much to know,  
it's just like lattice-C compiler.

Because if I change compiler at the same time I am trying new 
stuff, I get into the situation of not knowing where the fault is,
and have no way of resolving problems.

As it is now,  the files I have would not compile anyway, 
because I am obviously missing something, 
but I don't know exactly what.  (header file / pragma ?)
However,  with the missing bits, I CAN make my own 
stubs & things to get around the problem,
because I know quite well how mine works..

I seriously have to disagree with you here,   the biggest
problems so far have been attempts at changing compilers.

1)   I bought the dev cd-3.5 to try  StormC-v3,
      however, they WONT supply docs with it & I couldn't even
      get a "simple"  calculator program to compile without getting
      error messages that require a user manual to resolve.

2)  I downloaded the  "Dice"  compiler,  after spending 
     days getting it set up,  it wouldn't compile programs without them
     randomly crashing or causing bad references in the exe,
     it was no longer supported & doesn't handle pragmas either,
     so that was a fizzer....

3)  I downloaded a million archives for gcc,   
     eventually, I managed to figure out a quarter of what I have,
     but everything I try to compile keeps telling me I have
     some error with   ....ix...... ,  I still havn't had a spare year
     to wade through that pile.....

4)  I was going to buy Hisoft-C,  but several people have told me that
     it doesn't support  some things I need in it & is generally flakey to use.
     So that stoped that happening...

5)  I obtained v6.5 of SAS-C  as well as having user manuals, last week.
     I have "installed"  everything, but have not read the books yet.
     When I have some time, I will give it a good going over.
     As far as I can see, for now, it looks like the best chance I
     have to get a newer usable compiler..  

     Even though it is only 2 years older than my Aztec 5.2...



So, if you have any suggestions, I would really like to hear them....

Subject: @{b}More mui questions.@{ub}

Hi All, Especially Allan,

I`ve compiled Allan`s example source and after rereading the mui developers
guide I`m fairly happy with it all except this line:


         DoMethod(button, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Selected, FALSE, texteditor, 3,
MUIM_Set, MUIA_TextEditor_Contents, "");

Now I understand that it is instructing the object button to tell the object
texteditor to set it`s contents to "" whenever button is clicked but I don`t
get the syntax at all.

In my attempts to understand I tried to add an HTMLtext object and link it to
texteditor as Allan sugested but although adding the object was no problem
link the two was.

Any pointers?

   I know that, that's why I said 'I can't remember off the top of my head
the return type' and so just put the return type as rettype to represent
that it wasn't void.

   Sorry if confusion was caused.

   MUIM_Notify:

    method

   MUIA_Selected

    attribute type

   FALSE

    attribute value

   texteditor

    object to act on

   MUIA_TextEditor_Contents

   My explanation might be slightly out, but this should make more sense
yes?

Yeah, I'm happy to put some time into this.

Someone mentioned file areas on egroups - would this be sufficient, or would
we be better of putting up a full web-page somewhere else?  What does
everyone think?

In the meantime, if anyone has any helpful routines to contribute, you could

Using notification on an abject allows a method to be called when a certain
attribute is equal to a value.

In this case. The contents of the editor is set to "" when the MUIA_Selected
attribute is equal to FALSE.

A basic notify statement can be split up into to parts, the object and
attribute
you want to keep track on, and the destination object you want to do
something to
when the first part becomes TRUE.

the number 3 in the statemnt says to the compiler how many arguments come
after.
In this case it is MUIM_Set, MUIA_TextEditor_Contents, "" (i.e 3 arguments)

Guys, I hate to say it but my 3rd (and final) Amiga has just died on me.
I've now got 2Mb memory and half my hardware won't work. I'm going to have
to get a machine that's more useful for my real work (which probably means
an NT machine) :(

I'll take all my source-code and send it to Aminet and to any Source
Repository that gets set up.

I'll stay subscribed to the list for the near future though, otherwise
I won't know where to send the source to :$

Regards,

	Rod

Right I more or less get it now.

Can someone give me a few more example of this so I can really understand it?
All I need is more examples of this type of line. A good one would be the one
Allan suggested linking TextEditor to HTMLtext so it displays whatever HTML
is typed in the texteditor.

The autodoc for DoMethod() must be the most inadequate piece of documentation
I`ve ever read.

»

A web site would be much nicer, give you more control and allow people
outside of the amiga-c list to browse too.  eGroups.com IMO isn't
always the most realiable service and if they somehow lost all the
example files i'd get pissed off.  If you have a full website, with a
local copy, then its much safer!


» In the meantime, if anyone has any helpful routines to contribute,

A nice working collection of web links on the site/page would be good
too.  I did start this idea myself when I first created the amiga-c
list here, but then had no time to spend on it.  Good luck with it
Alastair!

From: Nick Lamburn <oruk_amigan@btinternet.com>
Date: 07-20-00 16:38:19
Subject: @{b}BOOPSI freeze ups@{ub}

Hello

Recently I have been really getting into the BOOPSI system; as it's just
waht I need, to be able to program my own gadget classes etc.  I have
successfully compiled BOOPSI code which uses the basic gadget classes like
'propgclass' and 'strgclass' for example.  I have also had success with
third party classes like 'TextField' class.

However the point of learning BOOPSI for me was to write my own gadgets. 
Problems of course have abounded and made most sttempts utterly useless.

Firstly:

I have attached (hopefully i can't get done for this :)) some example BOOPSI
code from the RKM: Libraries example source code: rkmbutclass.c.  The
compiled example on the ADCD 1.2 crashes when you click on the custom gadget
unless you resize the window first; then it is fine.  By crash i mean the
system freezes, no mouse movement etc. requring a Ctrl-LAmiga and RAmiga.

When I compile it with SAS/C 6.58, there a re a few errors; which i
corrected, and i compile it.  As usual it looks just the same as the pre
compiled one, and it still freezes when you click on the gadget to resize
it.  If however you try to resize the window; when you release the selection
button to confirm the new size, it freezes up like clicking on the custom
gadget.  Annoying.

I have tested this on:

 A1200T/040-25MHz&PPC/Wbench 3.0 and KStart 3.1 (haven't had time to install
 3.1 disks).  I have tried to disable caches, and to no avail, same things.

 Amiga 3000, 030/25MHz/882-25MHz, SuperKickstart 2.04 and Amiga Workbench
 2.1

The same behaviour is replicated on both machines.

Secondly:

In attempt to write my own class, inheriting from the gadgetclass, i set to
work.  Today i finished it, it's just a simple button type gadget since it's
an easy type to make. (even though buttongclass already exists :))  I get
the same behaviour really as the actual Commodore RKM Libs 2.04 example. 
Except on the A1200T is freezes up when the windows opened when the gadget
refresh routine is called, and on the A3000 the gadget is drawn, but
resizing or clicking on the window/gadget results in a crash.  (It does go
to a guru - no freezing)

I put debug output statements in and have not had much luck with getting it
to show me what's wrong.

Please help me, and correct where I am going wrong, and why it is crashing
because this is becoming really awful, if it was just my code crashing I
could accept that, but when Commodore's examples fail on two machines, one a
unexpanded A3000 (give or take the bridgeboard, isa card and extra ram,
bigger hard disk and that) with the 2.04 ROM (well softkicked from
superkick) - it is intensely irritating!! :-(

Please someone help before I give up!! 

Note that my source code is v. similar to the rkmbut whatever file from
Commodore since I didn't want to push myself too far to start with! :))

(I hope you don't mind the attachment being 8K)

All the best,

Subject: @{b}AmigaGuide DT help@{ub}

Hello,

I'm making another attempt at learning datatype usage and have
gotten a little farther this time.  I am trying to use the amigaguide
datatype.  I have two problems to start with.   If I open the window
smaller than the size of the guide file and then resize the window,
the display is not refreshed.  No matter what I do, the size of the
guide file is always drawn to fit the intial window size.  So if I 
open the window with width = 200 and resize with the sizing gadget
to 400, the guide file is still cut off at 200.

Here's what I am doing:

  open the libraries and window.

  open the guide with the following:
    dto = NewDTObject ((APTR) guidename, DTA_NodeName, nodename,
        GA_Left,    win->BorderLeft,
        GA_Top,     win->BorderTop,
        GA_Width,   win->Width - win->BorderLeft - win->BorderRight,
        GA_Height,  win->Height - win->BorderTop - win->BorderBottom,
         ICA_TARGET, ICTARGET_IDCMP,
         TAG_DONE);
   AddDTObject (win, NULL, dto, -1);
   RefreshDTObjects (dto, win, NULL, NULL);
 
And second, how do I change the node being shown.  I found the following
will allow me to display the contents or index of the file, but what about
a specific node?  If I close everything down and re-issue the above
commands it works but that doesn't seem like the proper way to do it?

        struct dtTrigger dtt;
        dtt.MethodID     = DTM_TRIGGER;
        dtt.dtt_GInfo    = NULL;
        dtt.dtt_Function = STM_CONTENTS,          // or STM_INDEX;
        dtt.dtt_Data     = NULL;

Keep in mind that all of the above may not even be the correct way to

GADGETCLASS should be "frbuttongclass", e.g.:

 gad = (struct Gadget *) NewObject(NULL, **"frbuttongclass"*,*
                                      GA_Left, win->BorderLeft + 5,
                                      GA_Top, win->BorderTop + 5,
                                      GA_Width, 64,
                                      GA_Height, 64,
                                      GA_Border, &border,

ehhh... I forgot to tell you how I did workaround for this bug... It's simple:
I created temporary bitmap and rastport with layer and layerinfo (it could be
done either in OM_NEW and GM_RENDER - you should check if size of visible area
 of gadget was changed - be _very_ careful while calculating size, you must
support right/bottom relative tags/flags as well, especjally when you're
writing gadgets that will be placed in SYS:Classes/Gadgets/ as I did), and
gadget renders graphics to this rastport, then bitmap is blitted  to
msg->gpr_RPort. It needs more memory but it looks better (you don't see how
lines appears on screen ;).

Gabriele Svelto,

Just to expand and explain what Nick has said - the boopsi class "GADGETCLASS" does not have its own imagery, so your code created it, but did not have anything to draw.  There is a subclass "frbuttongclass" which uses one of the image class objects automatically.  You can create your own image boopsi objects and attach them to GADGETCLASS objects with one of the tags, so they can appear any way you like.  I think there is an example in the RKMs of how to attach the system arrow image objects (such as those in workbench windows) to gadgets.

You MUST use this option not sometimes yes, sometimes no!!! dispatcher

I'll send you my own compiled version so you will know is this bug is fault of
the program or not correct compilation... On my computer C= example works
fine, but texted freeze my computer (you CANNOT use puts() or any other
similar function in dispatcher in parts that is called from intuition - after
#define puts(string)  gadget works fine)...

Having all requesters opened in the top-left looks rather stupid.

DoMethod just invokes a method on an object. A method can take a
variable number of arguments, but you have to learn about this on a pr.
method basis.  The MUIM_Notify method is documented in the autodoc
mentioned above.

Have you tried the Miami SDK?  AFAIK they're both compattable.

I remember I had lots of trouble with GCC (they seem to be SAS orientated).

Dammit... MUI_MakeObjectA() is in the muimaster.library, and the
compiler knows by having seen the proper 'pragma'-definition, thus
inserts something like "move.l MUIMasterBase(a4), a6; jsr
_LVOMUI_MakeObjectA(a6)".  MUI_MakeObject() on the other hand is the
variable argument variation, where thee compiler needs to build the
argument list on the stack, and pass a pointer to this to the former
function. Most compilers can do this on-the-fly (again by seeing proper
pragma-stuff), but if it can't, you need either a link library (which
declare a stub function) or you simply declare the stub function
yourself, as I did in my second reply...

Your compiler lacks the ability to generate stubs on the fly, so you
would be able to compile with another compiler.

Personally I wouldn't take someone elses source and compile it with my
favourite compiler, cause it often leads to tons of errors, and it's
quite tedious to spend your time fixing these.  Instead write something
yourself, line by line -- it's fine with copy'n'paste, but take only
small portions at a time, that'll ensure that each time you get a
compiler error, you should only get one, and you should know exactly
which line has caused the problem...

Well, rtpatch does it`s job, that`s not the problem, reqtools is.

And apart from this - I can`t tell my users to use rtpatch
to avoid ugly requester-layout with my program...

get() is a shortcut for GetAttr() in the intuition. It is used to
get a variable. Take a look to mui.h

CW>       And, what is the "Method"  it is doing  ??

DoMethod() is like a calling function with more flexiblity, but
technically is totally different.

Every class can handle some methods, for example there are in the
MUI_Window.doc listed all public methods that are implemented by
the window class itself. For example there is MUIM_Window_ToFront
and you can use it to bring you MUI window to front:

DoMethod(winobj,MUIM_Window_ToFront)

You can't really see what DoMethod() does there. But if you create
your own custom class using the window class as the super class you
can overload the MUIM_Window_ToFront method and add your own
features. (It is quite simple.)

----

Ok, let's suppose we have a text object. In the mui.h there is
a complete class tree and looking on it you can see the area class
is the super class of the text class. Therefore you can perform
area methods (and attributes) on your text object. Every unknown
method (or a tag value) is passed to its superclass.

This makes it possible you can use *every single tag or method* on
your object if the class or *any* of its super class knows about it.

For example, you can set the background for every child of the area
class BUT (!!) it is possible that some class derived from the area
class overrides your tag or method. This is class dependant.

Certainly you can't mix features of totally different classes.
I.e. you can use features of the notify class on both window and
area objects since they have same parents. But you can't use area
methods on the window object (this is quite obvious).

Oh, by the way... this is not always obvious, but some methods
can be used only in the custom class code. This includes MUIM_Hide,
MUI_Show, MUIM_Draw and many more. Never ever call custom class
methods yourself. These must be overloaded instead, but it is
another issue...

---

More about MUI... To create a MUI application you need at least
three objects: application object, window object and group objet.
Window objects are attached to the app object, when the group
object is attached to the window object. This group object must
contain all GUI elements for the window (buttons etc.). To control
the layout you can use subgroups and connect everything to the
one main group.

Allan's example contains only one window:

            MUIA_Application_Window, win = WindowObject,

Two next lines contains some attributes for this window, and then:

                WindowContents,            VGroup,
                        Child, texteditor = TextEditorObject, End,
                        Child, button = SimpleButton("Clear"),

                    End, /* VGroup */

This creates a vertical group and two childs on it: the text editor
gadget and a standard button.

Allan used some shortcuts for readability:

---- mui.h ----
#define VGroup          MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Group

#define Child         MUIA_Group_Child
#define WindowContents    MUIA_Window_RootObject

#define SimpleButton(label) MUI_MakeObject(MUIO_Button,label)
---- mui.h ----

Setting up notify statements isn't obvious for beginners and IMO
cut'n'paste is the shortest way. Just try something with the code,
add new buttons, change VGroup to HGroup, try adding a new window
or something. When I started MUI programming I was very confused
but got the idea quickly just trying something own... It is easy!

Could you tell me exactly what includes you are including

and what  .lib 's   you are linking to it if any ?,
you said that you didn't link ANY libs, but how

IIRC, the AmiTCP includes don't work with Storm, but the Miami ones
do, and provide the same functionality, ie protos etc. for bsdsocket

Hi,

OO is a funny thing - it can take *ages* to get it - then suddenly the
lights come on, and your coding style is never the same again!

The problems in understanding MUI / BOOPSI stem largely from the
difficulty of implementing OO in a language which doesn't lend itself to
inheritance.  (Calling functions "methods", and invoking them "sending
messages" doesn't help either!)

> I thank you for your assumtion-less  descriptions

Looks like our web-page will have to include tutorials as well as source.

Which reminds me - I'm happy to put this page together, but so far
there's not much in the way of source to put on it - so:

If anyone has any routines, short programs or explanations of
poorly-documented parts of the Amiga's OS (or 3rd-party stuff like MUI),
which they think would be useful to others, *send them to me*!

All the best,

I didn`t meant to use anything else than OS functions but this
is no excuse for bad layout.

And when it comes for OS functions - why doesn`t have ASL lib neither
a string-requester nor a color-requester?

I have a couple of programs that I would like to revamp
with this stuff,  however, most users around here have wb3.1 not 3.5
so I can't use Reaction,  several use MUI for other apps
so that shouldn't be a problem,  but several others don't...

What I think I should do is use native BOOPSI classes,
that way it will work anywhere, as well as being portable to the
new Amiga using BOOPS,  which I guess will be very similar
to BOOPSI on the classic,, (just assuming)

So I would be interested in getting some basic examples of
BOOPSI class windows & gadgets thereon, if anybody is
willing to supply demo's or can tell me where they can be found.

   Nope, all I know is that it works like a dream for me as a user :-)

   It's the way the OS works, EasyRequestArgs() bungs the requester in to
top left corner.  I suspect there is a reason for this and the one i'm
thinking about is the fact that the Amiga's GUI is active from startup, you
don't need to load it unlike some OS's and so it is perfectly possible to
get a requester appearing while only a DOS shell is open on startup with a
very small screen etc, it might be that at that point the relevant
libraries that enable you to get screen info aren't available, so the safest
place to open the requester is at 0,0.

> And when it comes for OS functions - why doesn`t have ASL lib neither

   Never needed these, but I thought ASL had a font requester.  What does
the font preference program use?

   Color has always been done manually though hasn't it, again look at
palette preference program.

I think the terminology comes from SmallTalk, where objects actually
received a message.
I'm quite sure the C++ standard defines 'methods' as member functions
and 'attributes' as member data. But the unlogical terms are shorter,
thus most used ;-)

Well, you could try getting a pointer to the public screen,
looking at the size of the screen, opening your own custom requester

I know ;) The bigger your screen gets, the more stupid it looks too.

Yeah, there are a couple of programs on Aminet which you can use
to replace it... I can't remember the names off the top of my head.
(I've tried a few, but always went back to RTPatch :)

The ReAction BOOPSI objects used to be called "ClassAct".  The binaries were freely distributable, but the authors charged something for the developers kit - the opposite way around to MUI.  You could include the old ClassAct version with your program (I think the pre-bundle AWeb did this), although I do not know how much they have changed in 3.5.  It doesn't seem to be on Aminet though.  I can dig around if you are interested.

I would prefer to use whatever came with WB3.1 as I would rather
distribute programs that don't require "extras"  

As I understand it, basic BOOPSI classes were in ROM (Intuition)
and would only require a "standard"  3.1 install....

As I still don't know WHAT classes there are in Intuition, I will
assume they are not too flashy,  but I should look into it to see
exactly what is supplied,  if anyone already knows what "built in"
classes there are, I would be interested in the info...

So you know what gadgets classes are built in, they are: :)

 - Prop gadget (slider/scroller)
 - Buttton with no frame
 - Button with frame
 - String/Integer Gadget
 - Group Class (makes composite gadgets)

You can extend any of these and make your own new gadget if you so wish; and
if it works - which as yet it doesn't for me ;)

Also Commdore did release an official tabs, and calendar gadget, it's on the
Dev CD 1.2, and therfore i guess 2.1 as well.  

Remember, this is not just 3.1, but also as low as Kickstart 37.175 - 2.04. 
I don't believe v36.0 OS (2.0x) has the OOP BOOPSI functionality in it,
though i'll try on my A3000 tonight :)

I think there is a way, what you need to use is BuildEasyRequest.. 
and this returns a pointer to the window which you can move via 
MoveWindow to where you want. But with this you must listen to the 
idcmp port since you have complete control of the requester. You can 
also add support for hotkeys(v40 supports this).

Is PROGDIR: set up on its own when a program is launched?  Because it 
doesn't seem to work!  Open() just returns NULL.

PROGDIR:  is an automatic local assignment for the program that
is running, it is only accessible from inside that program
and is a valid assignment to the current dir where the 
executable resides, even if it is "Left Out" on the desktop.

There's a MUI list here at eGroups (named MUI) -- questions like this
are best served when sent there, but have a look in the archive first,
cause I have previously posted an example of multi-column lists to
MUI@eGroups.Com -- in fact I think the eventhandler example I uploaded
to the filearea contains a multicolumn list...

The hook definition that use the list to display the column

static LONG __asm DisplayLV_compteData (register __a2 char **,
                                        register __a1 t_entete_compte *);

static struct Hook DisplayAccountHook = { { NULL, NULL },
                                          (APTR) DisplayLV_compteData,
                                          NULL,
                                          NULL };

The set saying the list format, here 3 column definition each between comma
MIW=25 is for minimum witdh 25% P=\33c for center (look MUI_List.doc in
Autodoc of Developper MUI archive for MUIA_List_Format and
MUIA_List_DisplayHook for more information)
set (WI_compte->LV_compte, MUIA_List_Format, "BAR MIW=25 P=\33c,BAR MIW=25
P=\33c,P=\33r MIW=50");

Active the Hook
set (WI_compte->LV_compte, MUIA_List_DisplayHook, &DisplayAccountHook);

If you want tilte for each column
set (WI_compte->LV_compte, MUIA_List_Title, TRUE);
look for MUIA_List_Title for more detail on displaying tilte.

And finaly the hook that display tilte and data
static LONG __asm DisplayLV_compteData(register __a2 char **Array,
                                        register __a1 t_entete_compte
*Account)
{
    static char buf1[200],buf2[200],buf3[200];
    if (Account)
    {
      Node_compte *Account1 = FindAccount (Account->Key);
      *Array++ = Account->num_compte;
      *Array++  = Account->libelle;
      sprintf(buf1,"\33r%ld",Account1->Data->ListSize);
      *Array =buf1;
    }
    else
    {
      sprintf(buf1,"\33b\33c%s\33n",GetMBString(MSG_STR_numero_compte));
      sprintf(buf2,"\33b\33c%s\33n",GetMBString(MSG_STR_intitule));
     
sprintf(buf3,"\33b\33c%s\33n",GetMBString(MSG_STR_nombre_record_compte));
      
      *Array++ = buf1;
      *Array++ = buf2;
      *Array   = buf3;
    }
    return 0;
} 

it could be enough.

   Just bung PROGDIR: infront of any filename :-)

   It's OS2+ only I think.

   You'll know if it's working or not as if you don't have a high enough
revision of the OS you'll get a 'insert volume PROGDIR: in any drive'
requester :-)

   If it's still not working, check things like write access to the drive
etc...

Kind regards...

PMFJI, but I have wondered about this myself.  I know what it's purpose is
but whenever I use it, it is treated as a literal.  So if I do something
like
sprintf ( filename,  "PROGDIR:%s",  "filename");   and then
puts (filename);

I get PROGDIR:filename  displayed where I should be something like 
sys:filename.

What am I missing?

sprintf has nothing to do with dos.library thus will not extract the
proper name.
For that you'll have to do something like Lock("ProgDir:", ...);
NameFromLock(...);

Note that dos.library/GetProgramDir() gives the same result :)

Here is simple example:

        MUIA_Listview_List , list = ListObject,
            InputListFrame,
            MUIA_List_Format,  "P=\33r\33b BAR,BAR,BAR,BAR, BAR,",

It's 6 column list. First column is bolded and right justified,

Hello Hodari. I was in the same situation a year ago. I suggest you get a 
good book on ansi C. "The C Programming Language" By Kernighan and Ritchie 
is the most complete, yet woefully complicated for a beginner to 
programming.

I learnt the most from "C for Dummies" vol I & II. This skirts around some 
major issues, but it is mostly ansi compliant, without leaning on the 
DOS/Windows side of things too much.

When I was comfortable with ANSI C, I bought the Amiga Developer CD_Rom v1.2 
for £15 from epic. This is now an irreplaceable CD in my collection.

Good Luck, and I am willing to answer any questions you might have, I wish I 
had someone to ask a year ago :P

If I'm not mistaken, it is only set up for programs launched from workbench, not command line.  I could well be very, very wrong here, so please let me know if your experience is any different.

I think it works with CLI programs also.  There are certain cases when it is
not valid, but I forget when...

Running 'dir progir:' from the CLI would tell!  (I'm using an Amiga at the
moment :)

Ahh, this may be where I am getting lost.  Are you saying that 
PROGDIR can only be accessed by calls that belong to the dos.library?  
I was looking for examples of its use a year or two ago and found it in 
the source code for the program Term.  Several times the author 
uses something like
  strcpy (Path->Config->HelpFile,  "PROGDIR:Term.guide");
How does this work?

   Nothing, that's what you are meant to have!!!  AmigaOS will automatically
know that any calls to PROGDIR:filename really means <programs
path>:filename.

   e.g.

   void main()
   {
      long handle = NULL;

      if( handle = Open( 'PROGDIR:testfile.txt', MODE_NEWFILE ) )
      {
         Close( handle );
         handle = NULL;
      }
   }

   If you run this, you find an empty file called testfile.txt in which ever
directory the program ran from.  Of course this might vary for CLI launched
programs as the OS might use the current directory rather than the
directory the program resides in, I can't remember.

   But it definitely works from WB, I know I use it all the time :-)

Kind regards...

Alex

Subject: @{b}BOOPSI again & again@{ub}

 Hello coders,
I'm trying to write a private BOOPSI class and got a lot of problems. First of all I read the RKM section on creating a BOOPSI class and I've looked at RKMModel.c example file but whithout any result. First of all RKMModel.c is a little bit obscure sometimes. For example in the initRKModMClass() a Class *cl variable is declared and the value returned from MakeClass() is assigned to it whithout any castings. I searched the autodocs for MakeClass and found that it returned an IClass *. I searched the includes but couldn't find anywhere a struct Class { etc... }. Obscure indeed... I didn't understand too how I could from within the dispatcher get data from the Gadget structure of an object, how do I do that? Thanx in advance,

 Gabriele

It would not be a bad idea to have a compiler specific menu,
maybe a tree arrangement,  where each gui system has a

There are no exceptions, 
PROGDIR:   is always pointing to the  *PRO*gram *DIR*ectory,
you can CD  to anywhere you like,  but PROGDIR:
will still point to the directory where the program is....

This simply copies the static string (containing "ProgDir:") to
Path->Config->HelpFile.  THere's no need for you to ever extract the
real name of the program dir, as "ProgDir:" will work...

No book will make you a C programmer on amiga.

Well It's a real pity cause you need that kind of stuff
to be able to develop on your amiga. You can purchase
developers cd online anyway. The latest one contains 
the main rom kernel manuals in html and amigaguide format
and explain almost anything you want to know. 

Anyway you might want to have a look to ace on aminet (Amiga C Encyclopedia)
that is filled with courses and example programs on amiga programming.
The sad stuff is this information doesn't cover 2.x and 3.x systems, but
it's a start if you've nothing more. 
Many programs have been opensourced recently and these might help you to learn
too. Check on aminet the archives containing src...

And there is the mailing list of course.

Be brave and good luck :)

Looks good to me also (I couldn't access the site earlier though..).  I'll try
to dig up some stuff to contribute also.

Is this going to be exclusively C code?  Also, is RHA the best server to host
the site? (yep, I use 'em also :().

But 99% of MUI code is the same for all compilers.  It's only the hook &
custom class stuff that's going to change (unless clever #defines are used).

OK.  Thanks to those who have sent me sources for the site.

I shan't expand the tree to include new categories until I've got sources to
put in those categories.  Demo effects / algorithms would be great, and
input is another area which causes confusions.

I wrote some input routines a while ago for dealing with RAWKEY events,
(building a table of key-states, so the program can distinguish between
"currently down" and "pressed since last check") and I was really proud
of them until I found out that Win95 uses *exactly* the same technique :-0

Anyway, I'll try and get the site updated over the weekend.

Surely a my_compiler.h file can be made up to deal with compiler specfic
stuff (in most cases)  I'm sure I've seen something like that for sas/gcc.

Also, some datatype based sources may be available from
http://www.amigaworld.com/support/dta/index_f.html

(dunno, haven't look read hard - just saw it the other day..)

Could someone please tell me exactly how is
someone supposed to write install scripts.

I have no idea what bizare language they use there,
but it is extremely unpleasant to read...

Is there some sort of "Builder"   tool that you can 
use to create them...

I am getting sick of using old batch files...

   I think it is loosly based on LISP, the same language used for that game
called Abuse.  I didn't find the installer language too bad, but I have
never done anything majorly complex in it.

Hi

Can someone suggest me a working debugger to be used with gcc ?
Basically I need something that allows me to examine the heap, step
a program and put breakpoints (conditional would be nice too but :)

Gdb doesn't seem to work here (or did I miss something ?)

Thx in advance.

I think there's a guide to writing and the commands used for the Amiga
installer on the devcd.  I don't have my CD here at the moment.  If
you can't find it i can send you my guide direct?  It helps me....

I've got a bit of a problem with one of my current

Maybe the program in question doesn't have any Workbench startup code?

I'm thinking now that each item should have a "Type" tag, which will be one
of: C Code, C++ Code, Tutorial or Web link.

This is the *List's* site, not mine, so if you'd like to see something else

Your concern is shared - I'm not at all confident about RHA's competence
either.  Then again, the more charitable side of my nature says that
they're still just firefighting, and things *will* get better ;-)

A friend of mine does web-hosting, so maybe I'll be able to sweet-talk him
into giving me a few meg for this site.  Then again, the company who provide
the space aren't exactly the pinaccle of competence either - anyone got any
suggestions?

To put startup code in a Program depends on the compiler.

if you are using dice do this:

in your main entry change it to 

VOID main(VOID)


then in your programat the end do this

int wbmain()
{
       main();
}


That will put startup code in your program

I don't know AmigaE EasyGUI, but apart from REBOL/view then MUI is
probably the fastest way to slam together a complex GUI in
seconds/minutes... :-)

intuition/classusr.h is also an interesting include for BOOPSI class

You receive an object and a class pointer in your dispatcher, these can
be used to get the instance data of the object by using the
INST_DATA(cl, obj)-macro.

Gadget data belonging to your superclass should normally be accessed by
invoking Get- & SetAttrs() on your own object, but if you want to be

Ok, I've finally got it Allan.  I got hung up on thinking the string should
have contained the actual location name and was therefore not working.
Thanks for the help.

So to be 'clean' I have to Set/GetAttrs() on the object pointer? Since I am deriving from gadgetclass do I have to use SetGadgetAttrs() instead of SetAttrs()? BTW, when I redefine a method for my subclass I have always to call DoSuperMethod() before my own code or my subclass can stick with my code whithout executing the code of the previous classes? Thanx in advance

If you're after a minimum-effort font-sensistive gadtools solution, then you
could do worse than to have a look at the sourcecode of my FreeWheel
commodity in aminet/util/mouse.

I've not played with easygui much but if I remember correctly the principle
is similar to MUI.

I've done this and included the WBStartup stuff in my
program. It runs fine by clicking the icon from
Workbench, but it crashes sometimes when you try to
run it from the WBStartup drawer.

Kind regards,

Francis.

I don't know about MUI or REBOL, but I've been using GadToolsBox
which I downloaded from Aminet a long time ago - it has its flaws
but it will let you throw a Gadtools GUI together in no time.

Okay, here are some questions that you could ask
yourself at this stage:

o- What other programs are running from WBStartup?
o- What resources is my program using? What are these
   other programs using?
o- Does altering the STARTPRI help?
o- Is any prog supposed to be doing anything with gfx?
o- What does Enforcer say about all of this?
o- Does the program work with a cut-down
   startup-sequence and an otherwise empty WBStartup?

I hope this helps!

@NODE "Mail_177" " Why doesn't this code work? "
From: Donald W Millican <DonaldWM@stonelawdrive.freeserve.co.uk>
Date: 07-31-00 21:43:24
Subject: @{b}Why doesn't this code work?@{ub}

About two and a half years ago I decided to write a small database to
test my programming skills. I based it on coursework done in Borland
Turbo C on the PC at college. I decided to appraoch the project as
though it were a professional contract and drew up specifications and
peformed unbelievebly extensive testing. I implemented the code in a
modular fashion, writing and testing each function individually and
with all of the others. To finish the program I performed a full
program test - that's when it crashed.

I assumed (and still do assume based on my own debugging) that the
crash happens when the program runs and attempts to load its data
file. When the program was in its early stages, I created seperate
create-file and read-file programs which were then incorporated into
the main program as save and load functions respectively with no
changes whatsoever. These original programs have always worked
perfectly.

When PupilDbase is run under OS3.0 it will freeze and cause a system
reset during or after initial loading. Curiously, all three programs
work fine under OS3.5 with not the slightest problem.

If you're still awake after all that then you'll be glad to know that
I've got to the point - I can't figure out why the main file crashes.

I've supplied all the code and executables in my file attachment.
Could some of you test the program and see if you know why it crashes
(sorry, the code is uncommented but should be fairly obvious to
understand). Don't forget to change the paths for loading and saving
the data file to wherever you are running the program from.

Any help appreciated.

Thanks,
Donald
