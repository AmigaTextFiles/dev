CHUNKY GRAPHICS LIBRARY
Version 2.27 (17-Dec-98)
Public Release 1

Welcome to the wonderful world of 8-bit chunky!

So, you want a standardised method of reading, writing and displaying chunky
data in your Amiga application?  Not too hot on the idea of using RTGMaster
or "rolling your own" methods?  Don't care for system hacks?  In that case,
you've downloaded the right thing!

This link library for your C compiler (not a shared lib yet until I get my
copy of StormC)  will handle everything to do with <=256 colour chunky
pictures.  Features:

* Transparent support for AGA/CGFX
* High-level and low-level commands available
* Draw from one chunky buffer to another
* Uses RastPort's instead of BitMap's
* Simple transparacy option
* Read and write chunky data files to and from disk (supports compression
  as well)
* Text support (draw Amiga bitmap fonts onto chunky buffers)
* Features most of the basic graphics.library calls but works with chunky
  buffers
* All written in ANSI C (although AGA c2p/p2c stuff isn't)
* All sources included
* It's freeware!

That list got your motor running?  Thought so...

Please read the usage.txt and license.txt files in the archive for further
information.

THIS IS NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED!  If you are learning C or unsure what
chunky is (why? :) do not download this!
