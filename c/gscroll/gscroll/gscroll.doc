Introduction
------------

I've written this program as I got a CD with many colour fonts and IFF Fonts
on it and thought one some so calles "Intros" which are mostly written in
Assembler and not very system friendly.

This program uses only system functions (for scrolling, blitting and remapping.)
In the current form, remapping is only done under OS3.x and higher.
The program should also work on OS2.x but I could not test this.

One example font is included and also an example usage with topaz/11. This
only works, if you have installed the Font Datatype (can be found on aminet).

I cannot make clear statements on the speed of the program. On my A4000/040
it is quite a smooth scrolling. At least it should not flicker somehow.
Also the speed much depends on the size of the font. While topaz/11 is so fast
that you cannot read it, with the font14 color font it is acceptable.

Installation & Requirements
---------------------------

For full functionality, you should have OS3.x installed. If you want to use
normal fonts you also need to have installed the Font Datatype which is
(C) 1995 Michael Letowski.

Of course you need an Amiga. Probably it is good to have at least an 68020.
(No panic, the program is not compiled with an 68020+ option ;-)

OS3.x is also needed for remapping of the colors of a font. I've planned
to add this to OS2.x somewhen, too, if I know what to do with the program 
itself. The program fully relies on datatypes picture class(es).

If you use OS2.x, you also must have iff.library installed which can be
found on aminet (iff_library_23_2, util/libs).

Installation is done as follows:

Copy the main executable to a directory in your path. It only runs from CLI.

If you want to use the included Font14, copy the gscroll.font14 to firstly
ENVARC:gscroll and secondly ENV:gscroll.

Copy this doc in you favourite Doc drawer, for example HELP:English.

Usage
-----

GScroll. Copyright (C) 1995 by Reinhard Katzmann. All Rights Reserved.
Usage: gscroll IFFFONT/A,TEXTFILE/A,W=WIDTH/K,H=HEIGHT/K,D=DEPTH/K,N=NUMCROW/K,R=ROWS/K,C=CHARS

IFFFONT/A: Required Argument. This must be an IFF picture (or an picture which
can be produced by using datatypes picture class(es). So you can use f.e. the
Font Datatype for using "normal" or color fonts.

TEXTFILE/A: Required Argument. This is the text which should be scrolled. It
can have several lines (newline characters are replaced by blank characters).

W=WIDTH/K: Optional. The Width of the font (defaults to 32). This includes 
spacing between the font characters (Important if you count the pixels with
the help of a paint program).

H=Height/K Optional. Height of the font (defaults to 32).

D=Depth/K: The Depth of the Font (defaults to 3). A "normal" font has 1
depth, i.e. two colors). Warning: The Font Datatype seems to have some
problems with Color Fonts who have Depth>3 (at least with my CD).

N=NUMROW/K: Optional. Number of Font Charakters in a row. (defaults to 10).

R=ROWS/K: Optional. Number of Rows of Font Charakters (Defaults to 6).

C=CHARS: Array of Charakters which must have the same sequence as in the font.
(look at gscroll.font14 and FONT14 itself for an example usage.)


Bugs/Known Bugs
---------------

Resizing: If you resize the program, the current displayed scroll line diss-
appears. I was too lazy to write a proper restore function for that.

OS2.x: Remapping does not work. You can add it by changing every pixel using
ReadPixel/WritePixel. This is not too fast though. You should also skip the
first four colours which are used for the standard Window/Menu look.

Speed: I've found no way how to slow down the scrolling a bit optionally. The
Delay() function slows the scrolling much too much down. Any Ideas welcome!

If you have found a serious Bug, let me know about it or repair it yourself ;)
but send me a copy of your work.

Ideas/Future Improvements
-------------------------

As I stated in the introduction I've written this program mainly to test if it
is possible, to write a system friendly scroll routine. Now I need some ideas
of you what could be done with the scroll function. Some ideas from me:

- Create a BOOPSI (for me BGUI Boopsi) Class to be able to have a Scroller
  Info Gadget. Critical problem: Multitasking with other gadgets (slows down
  or even stops the scroller for some time if not properly implemented).

- Improve Speed and add some fancy features like sinus scrolling (any ideas ?)
  (and solve the delay problem by the way :-)

- A GUI which lets you choose all necessary parameters (Width, Height, Depth,
  Picture etc.) and lets the scroller optionally run on an own/public screen.

Send me your ideas and/or comments to GScroll (EMAIL prefered) and I will see
what I can make out of this program. FIrst and Foremost programming hints are
very welcome (for Adress see Author address section below).
