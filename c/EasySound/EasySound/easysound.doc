   NAME
       GetClockSpeed -- Determine the clock speed for PAL / NTSC

   SYNOPSIS
       clock = GetClockSpeed()

       LONG GetClockSpeed( void )

   FUNCTION
       This function returns the clockspeed for e.g samples depending
       on the system you use (NTSC or PAL).

   NAME
       LoadIff -- Load an external sample in the chip memory

   SYNOPSIS
       info = LoadIff(filename)

       struct SoundInfo *LoadIff(STRPTR)

   FUNCTION
       Loads an external 8svx sample in chip memory and returns a pointer
       to the SoundInfo structure or NULL if the whole thing failed.

   INPUTS
       filename    - Name of the file, eventually with path.

   NAME
       PlayIff -- Play an IFF sample

   SYNOPSIS
       success = PlayIff(info, vol, chan, prio, drate, times, start,
                         time, wait)
       BOOL PlayIff
           (struct SoundInfo *, UWORD, UBYTE, BYTE, WORD, UWORD, ULONG,
            ULONG, BOOL)

   FUNCTION
       Plays an IFF sample. The sample has to be converted to an include
       file with the aid of the external program 'iff2src'. The resulting 
       sound data has to be placed in chip memory using e.g. the __chip 
       keyword.

   INPUTS
       info        - A (struct SoundInfo *) pointer to the structure.
       vol         - The volume of the sound (between 0 and 64).
       chan        - The channel on which the sample will be played, can
                     be either left or right ;-) . You may use the magic
                     cookies L0, L1, R0, R1.
       prio        - State a priority for the sample. (may be something
                     between -127 and 128.
       drate       - The sample rate is already stored in the SoundInfo
                     structure. If you don't want to change the rate,
                     leave this value 0.
       times       - How many times do you want this sound to be played.
                     If you set this value to 0 the sound will be played
                     nonstop. (You may stop it with StopIff)
       start       - Where do you want to start the sample, leave this
                     value to 0 if you want to start at the beginning.
       time        - How long do you want to play this sound, leave this
                     value to 0 if you want to play the whole sample.
       wait        - If you set this value to TRUE your program will wait
                     until the Sample is played. If it's set to FALSE your
                     program will continue to run while the sample is
                     played.

   RESULT
       success     - Returns TRUE if the sound was played with success,
                     otherwise the function will return FALSE.

   EXAMPLE
       PlayIff(&splat_data,64,L0,-35,0,1,0,0,0);

   NAME
       RemoveIff -- Remove a previous loaded Sound.

   SYNOPSIS
       RemoveIff(info)

       void RemoveIff (struct SoundInfo *)

   FUNCTION
       Will flush a loaded sample and free the memory.

   INPUTS
       info        - Pointer to the SoundInfo structure

   NAME
       StopIff -- Stop an IFF sample

   SYNOPSIS
       StopIff(chan)

       void StopIff (UBYTE)

   FUNCTION
       Will stop the sound on the specified audio channel. It'll close the
       the devices and ports and free the allocated memory. If you call 
       this function without any sound being played it'll simply return.

   INPUTS
       chan        - The channel that should be stopped. You may use the
                     magic cookies L0,L1,R0,R1 for this task.
