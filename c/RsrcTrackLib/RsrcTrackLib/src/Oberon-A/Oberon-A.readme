Here is an Oberon module for Oberon-A 1.6.

Note that the functions rt_SetCustomF0(), rt_SetCustomF1(), rt_SetCustomF2() do
not work with Oberon-A.  An Oberon-A program seems no to put the same thing on
the stack as a c program.
But the function rt_SetCustomF0() can be replaced by Kernel.SetCleanup().
