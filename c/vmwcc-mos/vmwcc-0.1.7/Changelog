3 December 2003
+ Hand in project.  Works on trivial cases, does not pass any of the
  benchmarks.  Dissapointing.
  
6 December 2003
+ Remove alpha coff backend
+ Split the source up and re-write large chunks of provided code.

13 December 2003
+ Actually have code generating again
+ Start getting ppc backend to work
+ Added WriteLong and WriteLine code
+ Simple while loops work
+ version 0.0.1

15 December 2003
+ readlong implemented
+ 7 of the samples now work
+ version 0.0.2

17 December 2003
+ Fix segfault when making phi functions that had as an argument another phi
  function.

26 December 2003
+ Fix bug in reg allocation where two different vars could be assigned to same
  register in different paths of an if/then/else statement.

7 January 2004
+ Got BSS working.  With loads stores.  Arrays now work.

24 January 2004
+ Finally got prime.c working!
  Wasn't restoring vars->current to the old state in an else statement.
  Blah that was a pain to figure out.

25 January 2004
+ Stuck on register allocation problem, only to find I was overflowing
  the 32bit flag size.  So modifying to auto-expand the flag array.

27 January 2004
+ Procedures with no arguments working.

28 January 2004
+ Procedures with arguments working, though crudely done.

31 January 2004
+ Rearranged things in prep for reg-spilling.
+ Ran through valgrind and caught a bunch of errors.

11 February 2004
+ After being stuck a while figured out a bug on propogating out while headers
  in reg_alloc.
+ Other minor fixes and cleanups in reg-alloc.

22 May 2004
+ Long break during classes
+ Kernel 2.6 doesn't seem to preseve regs 5-8 across syscall.  Fix read_long

5 June 2004
+ Fix (in a hackish way) scoping rules.  Caused mem.c not to work.
+ Fix write/read of a global value.
+ Fix so that you can pass a global variable as a parameter
+ Fix PPC backed for the proper limits of constant loading
  (li is signed not unsigned)
+ Fix bug with passing a constant as a parameter
+ Fix bug with unary operation on a global
+ Fix structure handling in ppc_backend
+ Fix mod power of 2 -> andi conversion in ppc_backend

6 June 2004
+ Fix bug in finding the then path of phi-functions from if-joins
  if there's a nested while.  (nested.c now works).
+ Fix problem accessing an array of structs (a spurious load was injected,
  causing segfaults when run).  bm4.c now runs.
+ Made error messages give context.

7 June 2004
+ Fix bug when subtracting a var from a const.  (qsort.c now works)
+ Fix bug when negating a global (bm7.c now works)

9 June 2004
+ Fix a bug when comparing const to var (rather than var to const)
  now heapsort.c works.
+ Fix problem where phi functions not properly resolved on if/then case
  if there's an empty block.
+ Make the error printing ignore tabs to line up the arrow.

10 June 2004
+ Fix bug doing ReadLong() to a global [array or struct]
+ Can now pass arbitrary number of parameters.

12 June 2004
+ Fix offset calculation so that we can have more than 32k of data in BSS.
  (bm1.c now runs)
+ Fix problem when comparing two constants (let the backend handle it
  not the ir_generator).  (bm5.c now runs)
+ Fix problem when loading from a nested struct.  (struct.c now works)
+ Fix so FP relative (stack) variables work.
+ Fix bss offset code (assembler was doing odd things?)
 (mem.c now works)
+ Fix so that register spilling works.
+ Fix bug when doing a unary - on a global.

13 June 2004
+ Made command line parsing similar to that of gcc's
+ Cleaned up the code a bit
+ We were putting params on stack in reverse order but reading
  them back in forward order.  Fixed.  (bm8.c works now)
+ Fix bug where unary minus on an instruction result was being dropped.
+ Fix deep problem with the CSGBracket/CSGField/CSGIndex code.
  (bm6.c now works).  Boy if that wasn't a pain to track down.
+ Fix a horrible memory-leak caused by above fix.

14 June 2004
+ Add most of the C tokens to the scanner, even though we don't
  support many of them yet.
+ Re-write parts of scanner.c to remove all known Burtscher code.
+ Add support for "int".  Treated as a long.
+ Add support for char constants in single quotes.
  eg 'x'.  Support escape chars including octal.
+ Add support for declaring a function as non-void.
+ Add provisional support for the "return" keyword.
+ Add support for functions returning values.

16 June 2004
+ Add support for "for" statements by just treating them as complicated
  while statements.
+ Fixed so nested for loops work.
+ Allow assignments in declarations, at least for integers.
+ Add support for "!" and "~" operators.

17 June 2004
+ Add support for "<<" and ">>" operators.
+ Add bare-bones function prototype support.
+ Add bare-bones "link against libc" support.

17 July 2004
+ Partial support of "sizeof()" builtin
+ Partial support of ++/--
+ Minimal support for char arrays
+ Added support for autosizing char arrays
  ( ie,   char string[]="Hello";  )
+ Fix a bug with for loops containing only function calls.
