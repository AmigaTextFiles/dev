The sad, the losers, the ones that won't run.

bm0.c  -- gets caught in endless loop register allocating.
          Even if did compile, doesn't work properly
	  on 32 bit machine only 64

	  (embarassingly, I wrote this one.  The non "kill-time"
	   code works fine, though the sine wave doesn't work
	   well on 32 bits)

bm9.c  -- Segfaults.  Not sure why.

          Also makes 64-bit assumptions.
