ppc:
  add. sub.  which do an add _and_ update flags.
  So can merge  "add ra,rb,rc / cmpe rc 0" into one instruction

  load/store can have a 16-bit immediate in addition to a reg

  loads immediately followed by moves -> just loads

  only put link register on stack if we have leaf nodes


  for hand-coded assembly, stack adjustments use stwu 1,-32(1) rather than
add/store?  [no wait, mandated by arch]

  only allocate spill registers if in proc we know we use > 22 or whatever.


  merge li X/stw 0()  into stw X()
  

  ori x,x,0  is a nop
