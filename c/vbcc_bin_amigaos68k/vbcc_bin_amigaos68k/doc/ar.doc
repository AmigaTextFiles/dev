INTRODUCTION

    ar is a portable tool to handle file-archives, which are mostly
    used for linker libraries with the ".a" suffix.

    The functionality and options supported are designed to be more
    or less the same as with usual Unix-ar implementations. This ar
    version supports BSD-style and GNU-style archive formats.


LEGAL

    ar is public domain.


USAGE

    ar is called as:

        ar Command[Options] [PosFileName] ArchiveName FileName [MoreFiles...]

    Commands may be the following:

        d - Delete files from the archive.

        m - Move file to the end of the archive or insert at a specific
            position. When using the options 'a', 'b' or 'i' you have to
            add a PosFileName from the archive for relative positioning.

        p - Print files from the archive to standard output.

        q - Quick append files to the archive, without further checks.

        r - Replace files from the archive with new files, or append
            them when not already present. Similar to the m-command
            you may specifiy a relative position with PosFileName.

        t - Show the archive's table of contents with all file
            names and attributes.

        x - Extract files from the archive. With option 'D' the path
            in the PosFileName position is used as destination
            directory for the extraction.

    Supported options / modifiers:

        a - Insert/replace after the given file name (commands m, r).

        b - Insert/replace before the given file name (commands m, r).

        c - Create the archive without warning, when it doesn't exist
            (commands q, r).

        i - Insert/replace before the given file name (same as 'b').

        o - Preserve the original dates on extraction (command x).

        u - Only update files in the archive which are older (command r).

        v - Be verbose during the operation (all commands).

        B - Select BSD archive format (commands d, m, q, r).

        D - Specify destination directory for extraction (command x).

        S - Do not generate symbol table (commands d, m, q, r).

        T - Truncate file names to 15 characters, so no BSD or GNU
            long-name extensions are needed (all commands).

    One or more file names may be specified. Also wildcards are allowed.


BUGS

    Only few commands are already implemented: q, t, x.
