vbrowse by Volker Barthelmann

INTRODUCTION

    vbrowse is used as a message browser for vbcc. In conjunction with
    vsend, tovbr and showerr it can display messages of vbcc in a window
    with a listview gadget, start an editor and place the cursor on
    the source line that caused the error/warning or give a more detailed
    explanation of the error.
    With a configurable editor it should be possible to create a kind
    of simple integrated development environment.

    vbrowse needs gadtools.library V39 or higher.


LEGAL

    vbrowse, vsend, tovbr and showerr are public domain.


USAGE

    When run vbrowse opens a window with a listview gadget and creates
    a public message port. It will display all strings sent to it (by
    vsend usually) in the listview.
    If you double-click on a line that looks like a vbcc message it
    will invoke a configurable command.

    In error messages vbcc quotes one line of the file where the problem
    was encountered and displays one line that explains the error and
    contains filename and line number.

    If you double-click on the quoted line one command will be invoked
    with the filename and the line number as arguments. This command
    should load the file into an editor and place the cursor on the
    correct line.
    It can be configured by specifying 'editor string' at the
    command line where 'string' is the command to be executed. %d
    will be replaced by the line number and %s by the filename. But
    note that %d MUST be first, e.g.

        run vbrowse editor "rx my_arexx_script %d %s" or
        run vbrowse editor "ged line %d %s"

    is ok, but

        run vbrowse editor "ged %s line %d"

    is wrong.

    If you double-click on the line containing error number etc. another
    command will be invoked with the error number as argument. This command
    should display a more detailed description of the error.

    This command can be specified by the 'error string' option, where
    %d in string will be replaced by the error number.

    The program showerr is provided and should be ok for this.

    Also vbrowse accepts the keywords 'top', 'left', 'width' and 'height'
    to specify the window position and size.

    A complete invocation of vbrowse may look like this:

    run vbrowse editor "rx my_arexx_script %d %s" error "showerr %d"
                top 400 left 0 width 600 height 200

    (Some '>nil:'s may be a good idea, too.)


VSEND

    The program vsend is used to send some text (usually the error messages
    of vbcc) to vbrowse. It simply reads from stdin and sends the text
    without modifications to vbrowse, e.g.

        vsend <text_file_to_vbrowse

    If you have a pipe command installed you can e.g. type something like

        vc test.c | vsend

    to send the output of vc to vbrowse.


TOVBR

    tovbr is a very small programm that simply executes its command line
    and sends the result to vsend, i.e.

        tovbr my_command my_parameters

    is equivalent to

        my_command my_parameters | vsend

    So after e.g 'alias vc tovbr vc' you can use vc as before, but the
    output will be sent to vbrowse.


SHOWERR

    This is a very small program that takes an error number as argument
    and displays the corresponding page in the VBCCMessages.guide using
    amigaguide.library.
    It can be used with vbrowse.
