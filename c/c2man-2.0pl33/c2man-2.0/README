				c2man, Version 2

This is c2man, a program for generating Unix style manual pages in nroff/troff
-man, TeXinfo, LaTeX or HTML format directly from ordinary comments embedded in
C source code. It should run on virtually any Unix-like system, OS/2, VMS or
MSDOS.

You will need lex or flex, plus yacc or bison, and a C compiler (traditional
K&R 1 or ISO/ANSI will do) to build the program. You'll also need a text
formatter to format its output.

This version of c2man is copyright, but may be freely redistributed and modified
so long as:

1. The names of all contributing authors remain on the documentation,
2. All derivative works are clearly documented as such,
3. All derivative works remain freely redistributable under the same conditions.

As such, there is no warranty.

c2man owes a huge debt to the public domain program cproto, by Chin Huang, from
which much of the code is derived.

The manual page includes some automatically generated examples, which will be
missing if you try to read it before doing a make.  Running make will generate
the complete manual page, which you can then copy around freely.

c2man does not currently support C++, but if you think this would be worth
while, look in the file C++autodoc for information on how I envisage C++
support could be added, and get ready to volunteer.

By popular demand, there are a few trivial examples of different comment
styles in the eg directory.  I'm open to submissions from users too.


There is a mailing list for c2man users; it is very low volume and has a very
low noise content.  This is the preferred place to ask questions about the
program and discuss modifications and additions with the author and other
users.  You are encouraged to join by sending mail with no Subject: line to
<listserv@research.canon.oz.au> containing:

	SUBSCRIBE c2man Your name

Where `Your name' should be replaced with your real name.
Messages for distribution to everyone on the list should be sent to:
<c2man@research.canon.oz.au>.


The time I have available for c2man support is rather limited, but if it lacks
any features you require, feel free to Email me (preferably to the mailing list
address above) asking about it.  Unless you request otherwise, I will probably
cc: to the list replies to any questions that I get mailed, to save me
answering them again for other people.  I encourage you to go ahead and make
any changes you like and send me the diffs for inclusion in the next patch, but
it's a good idea to ask first in case someone already has the feature you want
in the works.  In order for me to integrate your changes, they need to be
reasonably "clean", and you'll need to update manual page as appropriate.

Please try to remember to include the c2man version number in any bug reports.
You can find it by running: c2man -V /dev/null

If you'd like to be notified automatically about new releases and patches,
answer yes to the Configure question about sending mail to the author.


Special thanks for their direct and indirect contributions to c2man go to:
    Larry Wall, Raphael Manfredi and Harlan Stenn for writing various bits of
    metaconfig, which generated the Configure script.

    Darrel Hankerson for the OS/2 and MSDOS ports.
    Rick Flower for the VMS port.

    Richard Kooijman for the LaTeX backend, and for fixing the TeXinfo backend.
    Diab Jerius too, for more work on the TeXinfo backend.
    Frank P.J. Ooms for the HTML backend.

    Vern Paxson for his suggestions on how to handle comment lexing better.

Thanks to the following people for suggestions & bug fixes is long overdue:
    Peter (P.) Barszczewski, Carlo Tarantola, Dennis Allison,
    Philip Yzarn de Louraille, Jerry Lieberthal, Mats Ohrman, Stefan Zimmermann,
    Dolf Grunbauer, Lele Gaifax, Carl R. Crawford, Jhon Honce, Chris Borchert,
    Jerry E. Dunmire, Marty Leisner, Dan Forrest, Ken Weinert, Ken Poppleton.

(Hmmm.  This is beginning to sound like an Academy Awards night...)


See the file INSTALL for Unix installation instructions.
OS/2 and MSDOS users should see the README.pc file in the pc directory.
VMS users should see the README.1st in the VMS directory.
