MoreReq V1.0
© 1994 Ketil Hunn
-----------------

MoreReq came about when I worked on project which needed to display lots of
data in a single requester.  The system EasyRequest() would get too wide or
tall when I tried to fit all data inside the requester (and large
EasyRequest()'s tend to be slow as well).  The solution was to open a
smaller window and let the user scroll through the data.

MoreReq opens a window with one listview and from zero to unlimited number
of buttons below the listview.  The user may select an item from the list and
perform various actions on that item (by pressing one of the buttons below).
The requester will return the number of the gadget pressed or 0 if the
requester was cancelled.  The user may also doubleclick directly on the items
in the listview to select an item.

MoreReq features many tags which can be used to customize the requester.
One very important tag is MRLV_DropDown which makes the requesters look
like a MS-Windows dropdown menu.  Other tags worth mentioning are tags to
centre the requester horizontally and vertically on screen, height and
width can be given in percent of the screen's dimensions, tag to put the
parent window to sleep etc etc.

MoreReq also features an extension to gadtools.library's CreateGadgetA which
allows easy creation of a pop up gadget.

MoreReq is very easy to use as its functions are similar to those found in
asl.library (mrAllocRequest, mrRequest, mrFreeRequest etc).

All functions are well documented in the MoreReq.autodoc and a small example
program with source is also included to show how the functions are used.

MoreReq is not placed in the public domain but copyrighted (c) 1994 to
Ketil Hunn.  You may include the library in your PD or SH program as long
as you state that MoreReq is copyrighted to Ketil Hunn and that you let
me know that you're using my library.  Commercial programmers must get
my permission first.

Hope you have as much use for this library as I've had.

Have fun...

Things to do in the future:
- MRLV_FloatText tag for passing floating text
- Notify the caller when the requester receives a HELP keypress
- Raw key SHIFT + CURSORUP/CURSORDOWN equals PAGEUP/PAGEDOWN
