Header-Creator V1.0 (Developement tool for C programming)
=========================================================


Description
-----------

Header-Creator is a tool for developing C programmes. It
is supposed to help commentating source codes, by inserting
a programme head as well as function heads.

Thus it is possible to keep concentration on developing the
actual programme code. The Header-Creator adds standard
heads to a source code which is able to be compiled. Those
heads already include the author's name and the date. Now
you just have to insert further information into the heads.

The original source file remains as a backup.


Installation
------------

Just copy the file 'hc' to your drawer c or any other drawer
you would like it to be.


Usage
-----

Open a shell and type the command 'hc' followed by the name
of the source file.


Example:

Ram:> hc test.c

In your current directory there will be created the file test.c
containing the heads and the source code. The original file
remains as test.c.bak .


Copyright
---------

Header-Creator V1.0 is FREEWARE. It may be used without any
restrictions. You are also allowed to spread the programme if
you spread the whole archive including following files:

I just ask users to drop me a mail so that I come to know how

and new ideas are very welcome.
