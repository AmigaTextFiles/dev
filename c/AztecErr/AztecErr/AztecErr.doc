History:

    Version 0.90  First binary version. Previous versions are rexx scripts.

    Version 0.95  Added ARexx Support Routins.

    Version 1.00  Better design. First general release.

    Version 1.10  Removed some enforcer hits.

    Version 1.25  Font independent window and gadgets. Second general
                  release.



General Description:


    AztecErr is a programmer-tool.
    It supports the quickfix-option of the Manx Aztec C Compiler system
    version 5.xx. It has a full gadtools user interface.

    AztecErr is a OS 2.xx only tool. It doesn`t run under Kickstart 1.3.

    AztecErr [AE] reads the AztecC.Err file and displays the contained
    errors on its window.
    On this window there are several gadgets. By pressing the gadgets you
    may simply scroll through the error list to the next, previous, first
    or last error. Alternatively you can press a key for each gadget.

    AztecErr has full env support. It sets up two variables with the line
    and column number of the current displayed error. You can examine these
    variables and i.e. call your editor to jump to the given position.
    (see  below).

    If you have RexxHost.Library, AE will try to open an AREXX-Port. So you
    may send rexx messages to AE with the same meaning than the Gadgets.


System Requirements:

    You need at minimum OS 2.xx. Version 36L  may  have  some  problems
    too, because some functions had not been implemented  in  this beta
    version.

    AztecErr is mainly interrested if you have installed the Manx AztecC
    system version 5.xx.

    To use AE automatically you should set the env variable  CCEDIT  via
    MSet (support program of Manx) to AztecErr. Also  you  must  compile
    with  option -qf for QuickFix.

    If you want to use AE in another  way,  you  can  use  a  batchfile.

    No Requirements but recommendments:
    ===================================

    If you are using an editor which  has  an  ARexx port  or  supports
    ARexx  or the best, your editor has also the  ability   of   macro-
    definitions  (i.e.  DMe,  Ced,  TTX  etc...), so  you  can  use  AE
    automatically.
    E.g.
    if you create an ARexx script,  which  examines  the  env  variables
    'AztecErrLastLine' and 'AztevErrLastColumn', you will be able to jump
    directly to the place in your text where the error has been occured.
    If you call this script after compiling, you can easily examine all
    errors and recompile it again, after correcting the last error.

    An example Script for DMe and TTX is included.

    Warning: You  can  use  this  abilities  of  AE  only  if  you  have
             the RexxHost.Library and loads it in memory, like explained
             above.


Legal Stuff:


        This  program  and  all files come with it, also the docfiles, are
        released as FREEWARE.

        this means:

            everybody may use AztecErr,

            everybody may copy AztecErr, if:

                1. You copy all included files, see list at the end of the
                   doc file.
                2. No changes are made,  this  means  the  program and all
                   included files must stay in the original form.
                   Exception: you  may  archieve  it; but in this case you
                              must also archieve the whole package.
                3. If  you  recompile  it, you have to include a notice to
                   the original author. If you also want to (re)distribute
                   in any new form you have to send me a copy.
                4. You may not sell AztecErr.
                   Execption: you`re  allowed  to  take  a  small copy fee
                              which should not extend 5US$.
                5. If you want to include AztecErr
                   or one of the  included files as a part of a commercial
                   package,  you  must  have  written  permission  of  the
                   author (address see below).


        I take no warranty or garanty for the function of this program.
        The whole risk of using AztecErr stays only by the user.


Installation:

    The best is to copy AztecErr in the same directory in which are  cc,
    as and ln located.
    But it must be in the current AmigaDOS searchpath

Commandline:

    AE supports currently only three commandline parameters which are all
    optional:

    TopEdge/N   This is the topedge where the window should appear.
                Default is 0.

    PortName=P  This is the name of the ARexx port AE will open.
                Default is AZTEC_ERROR_PORT.

    Screen=S/K  If you want AztecErr  to  appear  on  another  than  the
                wbench screen you may specify here the name  of  another
                PublicScreen. Notice: The name is case dependent.

Usage:

    AE  supports the  quickfix-option  of  the  Manx  Aztec  C  Compiler
    version 5.xx. By compilisation if an error occures, cc will call the
    program which is the content of the env variable CCEDIT.
    If you set CCEDIT to  AztecErr  [options]  ,  so  AztecErr  will  be
    started.  AztecErr  reads  the  file  'AztecC.Err'  of  the  current
    directory and opens a window.
    If you quits AztecErr, the compiler starts again.
    If you quits AztecErr by using the Break  Gadget  ,  AztecErr  exits
    with return code 5 (WARN), which can  be  examined in batch files or
    scripts etc.

    In the second line are a lot of gadgets which initially displays the
    first error from the AztecC.Err file.

    Gadget list From left to right:

    Below Err:          This is the currently displayed error.
    Below Sum:          This is the total number of errors.
    Below Kind:         This is the kind of the error, either ERROR or
                        WARNING
    Below SourceFile:   This is the name of the source file in which the
                        errors has been detected.
    Ln:                 The line number of the error.
    Col:                The column number of the error.
    EC:                 The code of the error.

    Below               This is the description of the error

    Next Line:

    First         [f]   Activating this gadget or pressing 'f', AE displays
                        the first error.
    Previous      [p]   AE displayes the previous error.
    Next          [n]   AE displayes the next available error. If there are
                        no more errors the following text will be displayed
                        ----- No More Errors ------.
                        Activating next gadget again, closes the window and
                        leaves the program.
    Last          [l]   AE displays the last error.
    Quit          [q]   AE quits.
    Break         [b]   AE quits with return code 5 (WARN).

    You can type also the following keys:

    [i]                 Is the same than clicking the zip gadget of the
                        window. AE will be iconified.
                        WARNING: all functions are  still  available also
                        in this state. By pressing 'i' again, the window
                        will resizes to the old size and position.

ARexx Commands:

    This commands are equivalent to the gadgets above.

    FIRST
    PREVIOUS
    NEXT
    LAST
    BREAK

    QUIT
    CANCEL        CANCEL is a synonym for QUIT and is only supported for
    EXIT          compatibility with other rexx commands and libraries.


Technical:

    AE uses mainly OS 2.xx only functions.
    AE uses DOS-, Intuition- and GadTools.Library

    Because of the codesize there are no extra error- and  break-handling
    routines supported.

    So its yours, to take  care  that  AE  don`t  try  to  read  a wrong
    AztecC.Err file with a wrong format. If this happens AE may crash.
    Also you should not try to quit AE whith a ^C, because there is no ^C
    support. Maybe the window  stays  still  open  and  the  program has
    been terminated.

    If you don`t have RexxHost.Library , so AE is also fully functionable,
    but of course with the restriction that there is no ARexx port   and
    the env variables AztecErrLastLine and AztecErrLastColumn  will  not
    be set.

    You can call AE also with the command  'rxsend'  of  the  Csh-Shell.
    You doesn`t need an editor which owns an AREXX-Port, its also ok  to
    have an editor which is able to start DOS-commands ( MEmacs etc.  ).
    But its a little more tricky.

Last:

    I hope many people will use AE to program faster and easier and with
    a less amount of errors.

    If you find any bug of AE, please let me know.


    have fun ..
