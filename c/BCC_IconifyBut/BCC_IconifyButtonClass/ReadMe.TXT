What is this?
-------------

This  is  an  example  how  to use BCC to program BOOPSI classes.  BCC is a
development  tool for MUI and BOOPSI classes.  BCC allows to use C++ syntax
for implementing, creating, handling and disposing BOOPSI classes.  However
there was no example available showing how to implement a BOOPSI class with
BCC.

So  I figured out everything myself.  I transcribed a simple BOOPSI example
from  Aminet to BCC syntax.  The BCC author was very helpful and fixed some
nasty bugs that made using BCC sometimes quite painful.

If you are used to C++ syntax (for example when programming object oriented
GUIs with QT), you will surely like BCC a lot.

BCC  3.5  now  seems  to  be  quite  stable.   I can truly recommend it for
simplifying and speeding up your BOOPSI development.

PlayMF_VU.lha  on  Aminet.   It  uses  BCC  generated  BOOPSI  classes  for
visualizing  MIDI  music.   A  simple  MIDI  Player is included, but a MIDI
synthesizer is required.

If  you require a good tutorial about BOOPSI and the system classes, have a
look  at  the  BOOPSI Information Resource Center (BOOPSI IRC) at.  However
Tim uses the plain old C syntax.
