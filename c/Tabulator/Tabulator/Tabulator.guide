@{b}Introduction@{ub}



Tabulator is program that will scan a C source code file and adjust all
the tabs to your specified value.  It will also adjust any "improper" code.
Comments may also be removed if desired.


Since no 2 programmers write code in the same manner, this program is
needed if you wish to easily port others persons code.  If they use a tab of 8
spaces and you only use 4, it can be a major pain to manually reset each line's
tab settings, not to mention very time consuming and mind numbing.  Tabulator
makes easy work of this job for you.


Any code you adjust is assumed to be correct in the sense that each open
bracket, '{', has a matching close bracket, '}', that each line command is
terminated correctly, all comments are set correctly, etc.


Multiple files may be processed so entire programming projects can easily
be adjusted with minimal effort.



Example:


    do {

        Get;

        Print;

    } while(!Terminated);


    for(x=1; x<100; x++)

    Printf(x);


    for(x=1; x<100; x++)

    {

        Printf(x);

        Printf(y);

    }


    if (a==1) b=2;

    else b=3;


    if (x==2)

        y=3;

    else

        y=4;


    if (x==4)

    {

        z=4;

        a=2;

    }

    else

    {

        z=5;

        a=3;

    }


    if (x==4) y=0;

    else if (x==5) y=1;

    else y=2;



Tabulator Output:


    do

    {

        Get;

        Print;

    } while(!Terminated);


    for(x=1; x<100; x++)

        Printf(x);


    for(x=1; x<100; x++)

    {

        Printf(x);

        Printf(y);

    }


    if (a==1)

        b=2;

    else

        b=3;


    if (x==2)

        y=3;

    else

        y=4;


    if (x==4)

    {

        z=4;

        a=2;

    }

    else

    {

        z=5;

        a=3;

    }


    if (x==4)

        y=0;

    else if (x==5)

        y=1;

    else

        y=2;

@{b}EXTENSION/K@{ub}

Extension to append to newly created source file.

default: .tab
Will override the saved preferences.

@{b}GadTools@{ub}



Thanks to Olaf `Olsen' Barthel, author of gtlayout.library.  It is by far
the best user interface package.  Also thanks for all his programming help.


The user interface is totally font and screen mode sensitive.  All
gadgets and the window will automatically adjust to match your preferences.


The latest features are utilized to get the most from the operating
system and to make the program the best of it's kind.

@NODE LocaleSupport "Locale Support"

@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Locale Support@{ub}



This is program is totally localized to allow support for foreign
languages.  A catalog may not be available for your language at this time,
but one will hopefully be available soon.


If you are willing to translate the strings to another language, please let
me know.  If you do offer, a perfect translation of all strings will be
expected.  It is all or nothing.  I will also be seeking your assistance for
future versions that have new strings.

@NODE OperationNotes "Operation Notes"
@TOC Main
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Operation Notes@{ub}



Press the Help key for AmigaGuide help.


It can be started in WBStartup and iconified so it is always available.


Tabulator assumes that any source it processes is already correct, or it
could cause the output to be totally incorrect.


If using Remove Comments, the first comment of the file will not be
removed.  This is to allow for a header message.


@{b}Every CASE must have a matching BREAK; for proper operation!@{ub}


    switch(EasyRequest(...))

    {

        case 1: goto Top;

        case 2: goto Middle;

        case 0: goto Bottom;

    }


The above will not work properly.


    switch(EasyRequest(...))

    {

        case 1: goto Top;

                break;


        case 2: goto Middle;

                break;


        case 0: goto Bottom;

                break;

    }


The above will.

@{b}Hints And Tips@{ub}



To just remove comments from a file, set the tab size to the same size as
the source.  This will also just fix "improper" coding styles.


@ENDNODE


@NODE Incompatibilities "Incompatibilities"
@TOC Main
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Incompatibilities@{ub}



As of this version, Tabulator will make all switch()/case calls in this
manner:


    switch(Gadget)

    {

        case MAIN_OK:

            Printf("OK");

            break;


        case MAIN_QUIT:

            Printf("Quit");

            break;


        default:

            break;

    }


Hopefully a future revision will allow for:


    case MAIN_OK:       Printf("OK");

                        break;


    case MAIN_QUIT:     Printf("Quit");

                        break;


    default:            break;


This is my preferred style, so I will be working on it.

I try to make sure all new additions or changes work correctly before
releasing a new version, but, something might get by.  If you encounter a
bug or a problem with hardware or other programs, please let me know.  Do
not assume it will be fixed in the next version because if no one tells me,
I may not find it.


Please be very specific about what the bug does, when it does it, how
you found it, and how I can re-create it to test it.  Also let me know what
your system consists of: Kickstart version, hard-drives, memory expansion,
accelerator card, chip set (original, ECS, AGA), etc.


If you find a program that is not compatible with this program, please
send it to me on a disk or via electronic mail.



Thanks to Christopher A. Gaul for beta testing and several ideas for this program.

@{b}System Requirements@{ub}



This program requires at least version V39 of the operating system
software.  This is to take advantage of the new commands and new tags.  It
is now easy enough to update your system so it should not pose a problem.


This program requires less than 512K of RAM, therefore it should
operate on all systems.


To use the full potential, a harddrive and 4 or more megs or RAM are
recommended but not required.


The user interface can be quite large at times.  I strongly suggest you use
a screen size of 800x600 or larger.  If use a smaller size, the interface may
not be able to created.

@{b}About Swiss Army Knife Utilities@{ub}



The Swiss Army Knife Utilities is an every growing collection of programs
written by Mark Ritter.  All of these programs were written for a few basic
reasons: to make programming more automated, to replace poorly written
programs, or to fill a void where a program did not exist.


These programs are mostly meant to be replacement programs for poorly written,
or out dated programs.  Every needed feature has been incorporated to make the
programs powerful, yet very simple to use.


All of the utilities have been built around the gtlayout.library user interface
library.  MUI is an excellent package, but it is too CPU intensive and is not
based on the standard GadTools gadgets.  It all comes down to a matter of
preference.


The Swiss Army Knife Utilities have been written in well planned modular code.
All the programs have the same interface layout, the same AmigaGuide layout,
and the same operation.  If you know how one program works, then you know how
all of the programs work.  This modular code also makes for quick and easy
updates for every program.


Some of the global features:

    · They are all Commodities.

    · When iconified, it does so with an AppIcon and an AppMenu.

    · Drag-n-drop on AppIcon.

    · Extended select with AppIcon and AppMenu.

    · Drag-n-drop into window.

    · Extended select supported at startup.

    · Press Help for on-line AmigaGuide support.

    · Universal command line arguments.

    · Asl file requesters remember last path and file.

    · Fully localized and font sensitive.

    · Supports screennotify.library.

    · Most string gadgets have history.


Most of the programs have small interfaces, but a few are quite large.  All
of the programs are best used on an 800x600 screen; some will not fit on a
smaller screen.  800x600 is the standard, so the programs have been written for
this screen size.
