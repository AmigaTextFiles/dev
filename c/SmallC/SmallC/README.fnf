This material was submitted to me on disk directly by Willi Kusche, who
did the Amiga port, for inclusion in the library.  I presume this means
that it is acceptable to distribute this material for the normal small fee
to cover media, duplication, and handling charges (see the "no fee"
comment in "1stRead.MeE").  Thanks Willi!
