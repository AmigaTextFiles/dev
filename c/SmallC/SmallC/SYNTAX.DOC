       The compiler supports the following:

         1.  Data type declarations:

               char            8-bits
               int             32-bits
               extern char     external 8-bits
               extern int      external 32-bits

               A pointer to either of these types is declared by placing an
               asterisk "*" before the pointer name.  A pointer is a 32-bit
               stack offset.

         2.  Arrays must be single dimension (vector) structures of type
             char or int.

         3.  Expressions:
               unary operators:
                 "-"     minus
                 "*"     indirection
                 "&"     address of scalar
                 "++"    increment, either prefix or postfix
                 "--"    decrement, either prefix or postfix

               binary operators:
                 "+"     addition
                 "-"     subtraction
                 "*"     multiplication
                 "/"     division
                 "%"     mod, i.e. remainder from division
                 "|"     inclusive or
                 "^"     exclusive or
                 "&"     logical and
                 "=="    test for equality
                 "!="    test for inequality
                 "<"     test for less than
                 "<="    test for less or equal
                 ">"     test for greater than
                 ">="    test for greater or equal
                 "<<"    arithmetic shift left
                 ">>"    arithmetic shift right
                 "="     assignment

               primaries:
                 array[expression]
                 function(arg1,...,argn)
                 constants:
                   decimal number
                   quoted string ("sample")
                   primed string ('a' or '10')
                 local variable (or pointer)
                 global (static) variable (or pointer)

         4.  Program control:
               if(expression) statement;
               if(expression) statement;
                   else statement;
               while (expression) statement;
               break;
               continue;
               return;
               return expression;
               ; (null statement)
               compound statement:
               {statement1; statement2;...;statementn;}

         5.  Pointers
               local and static pointers can contain the
               address of "char" or "int" data items.

         6.  Compiler commands:
               #define name string
                 (preprocessor will replace name by string
                  throughout the program text)
               #include filename
                 (Input is suspended from the input filename and
                  text is read from the file named in the include
                  statement.  When end-of-file is detected, input
                  is resumed from the input filename.  A separate
                  output file is not created for the #include file
                  Its output is directed to the currently open
                  output file.)
               #asm
               #endasm

         7.  Miscellaneous notes:

               Expression evaluation maintains the same hierarchy as
               standard C.

               Function calls are defined as any primary followed by
               an open parenthesis.  Legal forms include:
                 variable();
                 array[expression]();
                 constant();
                 function() ();

               NOTE:  the various function call forms are not supported
                      in standard C.

               Pointer arithmetic takes into account the data type the
               pointer was declared for (e.g. ptr++ will increment by 4
               if declared "int *ptr;").

               Pointers are compared as unsigned 32-bit values.

               The generated code is reentrant.  Since local variables are
               allocated on the stack, each new invocation of a function
               generates a new copy of local variables.

       The compiler does not support:

         1.  Structures and unions

         2.  Multi-dimensional arrays

         3.  Floating point data

         4.  Long integers

         5.  Functions that return anything but "int" values

         6.  Unary operators:
               "!"
               "~"
               "sizeof"
               casts

         7.  The operators:
               "&&"
               "||"
               "?:"
               ","

         8.  Assignment operators:
               +=
               -=
               *=
               /=
               %=
               >>=
               <<=
               &=
               ^=
               |=
