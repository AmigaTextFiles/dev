[moderators note:  These were actually sent to me by Rich Salz (moderator
of comp.sources.unix) who got them from Mike.  This was in response to
a call from Rich for portable directory libraries for all machines...
   thanx Mike!]

Here's what I did. This is built to reflect the 4BSD manual pages, not
the SysV/dpANS manual pages.

I now know how to get the telldir/seekdir pair to work correctly with
multiple tell()s, but don't have much motivation to do so. If someone
out there does it, or is interested in doing it, I'd be interested in
the results or willing to help.

Final note: as with many micros, there's more than one C compiler.
This was written for the Lattice compiler, and uses features known
not to exist in other Amiga compilers. Fixing it should be trivial.

Oh, yeah - sorry for the delay in getting these two you.
