stdio/fhopen                                            stdio/fhopen

   NAME
        fhopen - associate a file pointer with an already open AmigaDOS
                 file handle

   SYNOPSIS
        #include <dos/dos.h>
        #include <stdio.h>

        FILE *fp = fhopen(fh, modes);
        BPTR fh;
        char *modes;

   FUNCTION
        fhopen associates an already open AmigaDOS file handle with a
        file pointer.  Note that fclose()ing the file pointer will also
        Close() the file handle - use fhclose() if you want to free the
        file pointer but still use the file handle.

        Refer to the fopen manual page for a description of available
        modes.  Note that when you use fhopen the file will not be
        truncated.

        The mode string should be similar to the access mode that was
        used to open the file handle:
            MODE_READWRITE      "w+" or "r+"
            MODE_OLDFILE        "r"
            MODE_NEWFILE        "w" or "a"
        Using an append mode will cause a Seek() to the end of file.

   NOTE
        refer to the file_pointer manual page for general information

   INPUTS
        BPTR fh;        BCPL pointer to a file handle
        char *modes;    modes string, such as "r+".

   RESULTS
        FILE *fp;       new file pointer or NULL if an error occured

stdio/fhclose                                           stdio/fhclose

   NAME
        fhclose - close file pointer from fhopen() without closing
                  AmigaDOS file handle

   SYNOPSIS
        #include <dos/dos.h>
        #include <stdio.h>

        int error = fhclose(fp);
        FILE *fp;

   FUNCTION
        fhclose flushes any data remaining in the file pointer's output
        buffer and then frees the file pointer, but without closing the
        file handle.  The file pointer is no longer valid, but the
        file handle is.

        fclose returns any error condition that occured while flushing
        the buffered data to the file.  The file pointer is still free'd
        even if an error occurs.

   NOTE
        refer to the file_pointer manual page for general information

   INPUTS
        FILE *fp;       file pointer from fhopen()

   RESULTS
        int error;      error number, or 0 if none
