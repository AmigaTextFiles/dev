StormGCC doesn't handle the long long's with the *printf commands very well (not!).
For example if you wanna do %llu or %lld, these things are just not possible by default.

This library should be set as the @{b}first@{ub} library in the library list !!!
It comes in 2 flavours. One for 68k and one for WOS. For easy usage, put them in your stormc:lib drawer.

@{b}xprintf@{ub} is a @{u}direct@{uu} (safe) replacement set for the following commands:

fprintf
printf
snprintf
sprintf
vfprintf
vprintf
vsnprintf
vsprintf
