/* $VER 1.0, ©1995 Stefan Berendes. Unlock GUI of Golded.Dice. */

/*

 Useful if some script failed, leaving the editor in a deadlock situation
 (GUI locked). DO NEVER CALL THIS MACRO UNLESS YOU HAVE TO DO SO. It is
 dangerous. If you unlock the GUI while some other ARexx script is
 controlling GoldED, the system might break.
