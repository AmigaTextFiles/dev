GoldED quickstarter V 2.4+ by Stefan Berendes in Sep 1995
Original source © 1995 by Dietmar Eilert.

This is a modified version of the quickstarter included with the GoldED
package. Replace this with the version installed by GoldEd's installer
script (Ed or GEd).

This version provides an optional FORCE/S commandline switch. If this
is specified, the program tries to find an ARexx port of the name
specified by the A=AREXX/K keyword and, if this port isn't found,
starts a new instance of GoldED with the specified config.

As of yet, GoldED does not support multiple configs. So I run different
GoldED's for general editing, programming and EMail. This can easily be
achieved by starting GoldED directly (Golded:Golded), but this will lack
the advantages of the quickstarter. So I modified the quickstarter
(luckily the source was included).
