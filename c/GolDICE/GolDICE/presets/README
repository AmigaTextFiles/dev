These presets for GoldED 3 (.1.2) are part of my personal DICE-GoldED
installation. They provide the most important DICE control on the
function keys and a lot of other useful scripts, all accessible via menu,
the most important via shortcuts.

Function key mapping:

F1  compile current text (call dcc with dccopts and addfiles)   dcc.ged
F2  dmake - run dmakefile in directory of current text          * dmake.ged
F3  jump to next error                                          DICE_ErrorNext.ged
F4  show current error                                          DICE_ErrorCurr.ged
F5  run program with the same dir and basename as current text  runexe.ged

F6  update prototype (cursor must be on function definition)
F7  insert case-statement                                       * case.ged
F8  - not used yet -
F9  revision                                                    * rev.ged
F10 mark next higher { ... } block                              * block


S F1  set DCCOPTS enviroment variable (DCC options)             setdccopts.ged
S F2  set ADDFILES (files to DCC besides current text)          setfiles.ged
S F3  jump to prev error                                        DICE_ErrorPrev.ged
S F4  jump to first error                                       DICE_ErrorFirst.ged
S F5  clear errorlist                                           DICE_ErrorClear.ged

S F6  insert new C function                                     func.ged
S F7  insert switch statement                                   * switch.ged
S F8  - not used yet -
S F9  new C header, generates search points for func, proto...  MakeCHeader.ged
S F10 fold marked block                                         * fold.ged

* the marked scripts are part of the original GoldED distribution.

The menu presets include all the scripts shown above, and also some useful
settings (IMHO layout control is very useless to a programmer). If you don't like
my settings, you can link only "Macros C" and "Macros other"  to your menu
settings. The macro menu can be found in DICE_MacrosUS.men and DICE_MacrosD.men.
Please note that "Macros/Macros other/Execute line" uses the same shortcut
<Amiga>-= as the command "Layout/Paragraphe block". You have to change either.

There exists no decription of the menu shortcuts yet. Sorry.
