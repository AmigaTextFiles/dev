   @{Bold "CProfilerPPC"} was originally a program listing from @{B}Dr. Dobb's Software 
   Journal@{UB}, August 1988, pages 82-94.  This implementation no longer
   performs in the same way as the original code.  It does print a
   document that shows how functions are called from the designated
   target function, a Module statistics page, a function index & an 
   un-used function index (if any).  

   @{Bold "CProfilerPPC"} now has a complete GUI that eliminates the need for any 
   invocation from the CLI.  There are @{" ToolTypes " LINK "TTypes"} in the Icon
   that take care of all necessary arguments that the program has to have
   in order to run.

   Creating a Profile from your source files is mostly a two-step process:
      1. Enter the filenames of all of your program's source code files in the
         @{BOld "Source Files:"} ListView Gadget.

      2. Select program output options & Click on @{" Make Profile! " LINK "CProfiler"}.
   
   This is why the GUI is divided visually into two parts.
    	 
   @{High "WARNING:"}  You must supply an accurate list of files in the @{Bold "Source Files:"}
             List View gadget, or the program will @{Bold "NOT"} produce correct
             output & might choke!
  
   @{High "NOTE:"}  Don't believe the Unused Function list without checking your
          sources.  @{Bold "CProfilerPPC"} is @{Bold "NOT"} smart enough to find references to 
          function pointers (& sometimes, nested function calls either).  In fact,
	  @{" I'm " LINK "Author"} thinking about removing this feature, since it's more inaccurate than not.

   @{High "NOTE:"}  Just because a function is marked with @{B}(LIBRARY)@{UB} does not
          necessarily mean that the function is a library function.  It simply
	  means that the function is @{B}NOT@{UB} in any of the source code files you supplied
	  to the program.  Some of these functions might be in a link library,
	  for instance.
	           
   @{" Program Limits   " LINK "Limitations"} - How low can you go?

   @{" Build Functions! " LINK "BuildFuncs"} - Function Table generator.

   @{" Load FileList!   " LINK "LoadFileList"} - List File Requester.
   
   @{" Make Profile!    " LINK "CProfiler"} - Profiler generator.
   
   @{" Check Gadgets    " LINK "CheckGadgets"} - Program option (& one mandatory!) selection Gadgets.

   @{Bold "CProfiler"} is not very smart about conditional compilation, example: @{FG SHINE}

      #ifdef DEBUG
      int somefunction( void )
      {
         ...
      }
      #else
      int somefunction( void )
      {
         ...
      }
      #endif @{FG TEXT}

   will cause @{Bold "CProfiler"} to conclude that @{Bold "somefunction()"} is defined twice,
   even though in reality only one definition will be used by your compiler!  Your
   listing should still be generated, but some statistics might be wrong.
          
   One of the reasons that @{Bold "CProfiler"} is so large is that there are some
   large Hard-Coded structure arrays in it.  These limits are:

   Maximum number of Modules:      @{High 1000}
   Maximum number of Functions:    @{High 8000}

   If you need anything larger than these, you must be working on a 
   Government project & I'd better see some cash from you!
      
   Maximum Filename size:          @{High 512}

   Maximum Function Nesting Depth: @{High 100}
   
   ToolType strings also include Path information as well as the filename,
   so be careful!
   
   Maximum length of ToolType ScannerName    = 512
   Maximum length of ToolType TargetFunction = 128
   Maximum length of ToolType OutputSuffix   = 32
   Maximum length of ToolType TempFileName   = 512
   Maximum length of ToolType ListFileName   = 512
   Maximum length of ToolType DefaultOutput  = 512
   Maximum length of ToolType HelpViewer     = 128

   @{High "WARNING:"}  Exceeding any of the ToolType storage space is guaranteed to
             cause smoke to come out of your Amiga!

   @{High "HELPVIEWER"}     = MultiView       (Default)

   @{Bold "NOTE:"}  There should be @{Bold "NO"} spaces around the '=' if you must edit these
          using IconEdit or some such program.
          
   The following ToolTypes will be over-ridden by the Gadgets in the GUI:

   First, the mandatory option: @{FG TEXT}

      You must select either the @{Bold "target function"} or the @{Bold "statistics only"}
   option.  If you select the @{Bold "target function"} option, the @{Bold "Function:"} String Gadget
   will be cleared & enabled so that you can type in the entry point function name of your
   program (usually @{Bold "main()"}).  If you select the @{Bold "statistics only"} option,
   there will not be nearly as much output from the program.

   The following options control the size of resultant pages of the output listing from the 
   program:
   
   @{High "page length"}  - Enables the Length Integer Gadget (Default length is 66 lines)
   @{High "page width"}   - Enables the Width  Integer Gadget (Default width  is 80 ASCII characters).
   @{High "right margin"} - Enables the Right  Integer Gadget (Default spacing is 5 spaces).
   @{High "left margin"}  - Enables the Left   Integer Gadget (Default spacing is 5 spaces).

   After these options are set to your liking, Click on @{" Make Profile! " LINK "CProfiler"} to
   generate the output.

  CProfiler was written using @{B}SAS-C V6.58@{UB}.
  CProfilerPPC was written using @{B}gcc V2.95+@{UB}.

  The GUI was put together with GadToolsBox V37.300 (14.3.93) (C)
  1991-1993 by Jaba Development.  I wish that there was an easy way to pay
  for this godsend of a program (Thanx guys!).
