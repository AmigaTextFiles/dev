Versionize is a simple tool that automatically updates the build number
and/or the date and time of compilation of a project.
Versionize is mainly targeted at the C developer.

Versionize is open source so you can use and distribute the code
and the executables in any form you like. If you like, I will be
happy to include modifications on the code back on the original
source so others may benefit from them.

Versionize should compile correctly with any C compiler on any platform.
Executables for AmigaOS (68k) and Windows are also included in the package.
They were tested on AmigaOS 3.x and WindowsXP but should work just everywhere.
