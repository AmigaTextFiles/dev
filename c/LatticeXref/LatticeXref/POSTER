This is a cross reference of all symbols referenced in the Lattice 3.10
header files, excluding stuff between NARGS defs (cross referencer didn't
like function prototypes...).

Printing the header files with appropriate line numbers is left as an
exercise for the reader...

This is part 1 of 3, edit and concatenate for best results.

Note that the '*' in front of a line number indicates the definition line,
as opposed to merely a reference.
