@NODE WHAT

                              What is AGL?


This library is a subset of the @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} graphics language.  @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} was
developed by Silicon Graphics Inc @{"SGI(TM)" link TM}.  The Amiga version presented
here is not produced, supported, or endorsed by @{"SGI(TM)" link TM}.  @{"SGI(TM)" link TM}'s unoffical
release of their API allows me to release my Amiga version to the
general public.

This software was produced using @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} user manuals and experience on
@{"SGI(TM)" link TM} systems.  No source was obtained or used from the original @{"SGI(TM)" link TM}
source.  The goal of this library is total upwards compatibility to a
compliant platform.

The user should obtain documents which explain the use of @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM}.
There are no lessons, tutorials, or texts included in this release.
I recommend the "Graphics Library Programming Guide" distributed by @{"SGI(TM)" link TM}.

@NODE DISCLAIMER
                              DISCLAIMER

This version of @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} is non-compliant and unlicensed.  It bears no
guarantee of fitness for any particular purpose.  The user assumes all
responibilty for any actions or damage resulting from its use.  Many
significant parts of the real @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} specification have not been
included in this release.

This library provides an introduction to the @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} graphics language
and is not intended for serious or commercial use.  Serious parties should
seek to purchase a compliant licensed version of @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} or @{"OpenGL(TM)" link TM} on
an acceptable platform.

If you truly can not afford the fee, you still register without it by adding
the following line to your registration: "I can afford all this computer
equipment, but I can't afford to support the work of fellow programmers".
If you have written a public domain or shareware program that I am using
(Vim, Csh, KingCON, HWGRCS, Enforcer, CPUblit, fASTERbliT, MagicMenus,
MagicWB, Toolmanager, VMM), state this and we can just call it even.

@NODE NEED

                    What hardware and software is required?

The library's source can be compiled for any Amiga.  I believe I followed all
the "rules" and avoided any tempting tricks.  The given library was compiled
for 68030 with coprocessor under SAS(TM) 6.51.  Check "scopts" to see how it
was compiled so that your code will match.

I use a 25Mhz Amiga 3000.  I would recommend this as a minumum configuration.
The performance is poor on a stock Amiga 500.

I now use a @{"GVP Spectrum(TM)" link TM}.  Version 1.04 promotes easily and allows
for 8-bit color indexes.

The compile scripts use csh (Csh 5.37 by Urban D Mueller/Andreas M Kirchwitz).

The middle mouse button is fully supported.  If you don't have a middle mouse
button, it is very unlikely that you will receive a MIDDLEMOUSE event.

                       What should the archive contain?

The following files, at least, should be included in this archive.  I may have
submitted the precompiled library separately or not at all.  Except for the
font, all these directories/files should be placed in a directory assigned
to "usr:".


The library:

  libs/
    gl.lib

My font:

  fonts/
    JXEN/7
    JXEN.font


The required headers:

  include/
    gl.h
    device.h


Some utilities:

  bin/
    basename     (executable; replaces csh's incorrect builtin version)
    prototype    (executable; my auto-prototyper)


The source:

  src/basename
    basename.c

  src/prototype
    prototype.c

  src/agl
    prototypes.h (will be generated automatically by 'prototype')

    agl.guide    (you're reading it)

    keymap.h
    agl.h

    border.c     (Motif(TM) style borders)
    color.c      (colormap calls)
    clip.c       (scrmask clipping using Regions)
    matrix.c     (transforms)
    poly.c       (primary drawing)
    que.c        (event handling)
    rgb.c        (auto-dithering for RGBmode())
    text.c       (text drawing)
    window.c     (window handling)

    mice.c       (test to read second mouse, not really used)
    sprite.c     (test to draw second mouse, not really used)

    makefile
    Compile
    sas.makefile

    RCS/         (revision control)


Sample code:

  src/gltest
    gltest.c


"usr:bin" should be added to your path.  Note that this not enough to
override csh's builtin incorrect "basename" which has to be aliased.
The Compile script for AGL does this alias to make sure.

You should also copy the font into your fonts: or AGL will use your default
system font.  The JXEN font is a reduced version of XEN from MagicWB by
Martin Huttenloher.  I believe JXEN 7 to be the smallest readable
fixed-space font.  I use it for my shells.

@NODE DIFFER


        How else does AGL differ from real @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} on an @{"SGI(TM)" link TM}?


1.  A single solitary optional Amiga-specific function is included to
configure the screen:

      long AGLconfig(short screenx,short screeny,short bitplanes)
        returns nonzero if successful

If used, this call must be made before any GL call or it will have no effect
and just return 0.  It specifies the size and depth of the screen.  AGL will
automatically use hi-res laced if either dimension exceeds a specific level.
The actual screen created may be different than what the user requested.  The
function getgdesc() should be used to get the actual values for the screen.

2.  If there are multiple windows in the application, window-independent
double-buffering is simulated using a blit copy from a backbuffer.
If there is only one window, true double buffering (of the screen) is used.

3.  Interactive window placement is not supported and all programs are run in
the foreground.  A warning is issued if foreground() doesn't precede the first
window opening.

4.  Intuition uses a structure "Device".  Therefore, the @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} typedef
of "Device" is intentionally removed.  You should use "long" instead to refer
to @{"IrisGL(TM)" link TM} devices.

5.  AGL is run on a separate screen that is created automatically on your first
winopen().  It is closed automatically when you winclose() your last window.

6.  Intuition does not have a window auto-kill and cleanup like on an @{"SGI(TM)" link TM}.
A sudden break (like CTRL-C) may leave the windows and memory in use.  Your
program should issue a qdevice(WINQUIT) to que the close gadget and close all
your windows when it is done.  AGL automatically shuts down when the final
window is closed.  As an added precaution, AGL uses the ANSI atexit() function
to shut down automatically during an exit(), hopefully.  However, you should
not rely on this as it is not clean programming practice.

7.  You should use AutoPoint and ClickToFront to act more like the @{"SGI(TM)" link TM}.
There will be a slight difference from the @{"SGI(TM)" link TM} in that a window will
retain focus even after the mouse is moved out and until another window is
selected.  This should only be a problem in that the middle and right buttons
may report outside the window.

8.  AGL has its own built-in window borders that should look and act similarly
to Motif(TM) as one would have under IRIX(TM) 4.0.X and beyond, including the
Maximize button.  However, the upper left menu button does not produce a menu,
but immediately enters WINQUIT onto the que.  The Minimize button does nothing
at this time.

9.  MagicMenus by Martin Korndorfer is highly recommended.  This would
actually be relevant if I were to add pop-up menus.

10.  Intuition can sometimes send double Refresh's resulting in double
REDRAW's.  If you read through the entire queue at once, you can eliminate
redundancy by only redrawing once.

11. I cannot directly poll the mouse buttons for getvaluator().  Instead,
I update a value on every message from intuition.  (Intuition messages all
give the current mouse button state)  The noticable difference is that when
a no AGL window is focused,  the AGL program gets no messages and, therefore,
the mouse button state is not updated.  The key states are done similarly,
except that they are only updated on key events.

12. I've made no effort to implement the obsolete MSINGLE matrix mode even
though it's the default.  The user should always call mmode(MVIEWING) or
mmode(MPROJECTION) before doing matrix operations.  AGL will just use
MVIEWING when in MSINGLE mode, but this may not (should not) be the case when
ported to another platform.  MTEXTURE mode is not supported.

13. winconstraints() is only implemented to allow the current window to be
resizeable.  I could add the full functionality in the future.
