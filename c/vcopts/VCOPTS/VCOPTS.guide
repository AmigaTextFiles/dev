@node Introduction "VCOPTS Introduction"

I was fed up with manually editing my vc.config files or VMakefiles, so
I started writing a preferences editor .. VCOPTS was born.

@endnode

@node Requirements "Requirements"
Requirements

VCOPTS requires bgui.library v41, formerly by Jan van den Baard, now by
Ian J. Einman (74271.2766@compuserve.com or ie@az.com), and
intuition.library v39.

VCOPTS also requires vbcc v0.5. (pub/aminet/dev/vbcc.lha)

The full user and dev packages of the beta release of bgui.library v41
are available from Ian's web page at http://www.az.com/~ie/bgui/

The beta release of bgui.library is included in the libs directory --
two versions are included; bgui.library and bgui.library_e. The latter
is an enhanced version for 68020+ and OS 3.x.

@endnode

@node Installation "Installation"
Installation

Copy VCOPTS to vbcc:bin, and bgui.library to libs:

If you want to use bgui.library_e, copy it to libs: then rename it as
bgui.lbrary.
@endnode

@node Usage "Usage"

When run, VCOPTS opens up a window with five pages.

    @{" Project          " link Project}
    @{" Code             " link Code}
    @{" Link             " link Link}
    @{" Misc             " link Misc}
    @{" Switches         " link Switches}

@endnode

@node Project "Project Page"

The Project Page has four buttons:

Save
Save options to vc.config in the current directory

Save As Default
Save options to ENV:vc.config and ENVARC:vc.config

About
Bring up a requester giving a short description, version number and the
date VCOPTS was last compiled.

Cancel
Quit VCOPTS without saving to a vc.config file.

@node Code "Code Page"

CPU   : Select target processor type: 68000, 68020, 68040, 68060.

Math  : Select target math library to be linked.

  NoMath : no math library linked.
  IEEE   : mieee.lib is linked.
  FPU    : math library linked is dependant on processor type.
              68000 - No fpu available, mieee.lib
              68020 - m881.lib
              68040 - m040.lib
              68060 - m040.lib

Code  : Select between large and small code to access external functions.

  Large Code : Use absolute 32 bit addresses
  Small Code : Use 16 bit offsets.

Data  : Select between large and small data to access static data.

  Large Data : Use absolute 32 bit addresses
  Small Data : Use 16 bit offsets.

Opt   : Select level of optimisation.

  Default  : Use default (non-specified) optimisation.
  None     : No optimisation at all.
  Opt 1    : Level 1
  Opt 2    : Level 2
  Opt 3    : Level 3

  See vbcc://doc/vbcc.doc for further details on optimisation.
@endnode

@node Link "Link Page"

Name    : Name of destination executable.

Output  : Select between producing an executable or object files.

  Executable : Compile and link.
  Objects    : Compile only.

Startup : Select startup code.

  startup.o  : Link full startup code (vlib:startup.o)
  minstart.o : Link minimal startup code (vlib:minstart.o)

Compile : Tell vbcc whether to compile code or not.

Assemble : Tell vbcc whether to assemble code or not.
@endnode

@node Misc "Misc Page"

System    : use ixemul.library or normal amigados libraries.

  No ixemul.library  :
    Standard startup code is used (startup.o or minstart.o)
    vc.lib and amiga.lib are linked (vcs.lib and amigas.lib for Small Data).
    vcpp/dcpp uses vinclude: as it's include file search path.

  ixemul.library  :
    Startup code is crt0.o (bcrt0.o when Small Data is selected)
    ixemul.lib is linked (ixemuls.lib for Small Data)
    No math libraties are linked.
    vcpp/dcpp uses ixinclude: as it's include file search path.

Messages  : Type of messages during compilation

    Quiet   : Only error/warning messages are printed during compilation.
    Verbose : Copyright messages, error/warning messages and command
              executed are printed during compilation.

Pre-processor : Choice of C pro-processor

    vcpp    : standard vbcc pre-processor
    dcpp    : use dcpp from the DICE C compiler. Not very useful since 
              dcpp outputs lines such as

              #1 file.c 1

              but vbcc is expecting

              #line 1 file.c

Assembler : Choice of assembler

    PhxAss  : Use Frank Willie's PhxAss (supplied with vbcc)
    GNU as  : Use the GNU as assembler
    pasm    : Use the forthcoming PowerPC assembler

Compiler     : Choice of compiler

    68k     : Use Motorola 680x0 compiler (vbcca68k)
    i386    : Use Intel i386 compiler
    PPC     : Use the forthcoming Motorola PowerPC compiler (StormC will
              _not_ be the only PPC compiler :-)
@endnode

@node Switches "Switches Page"

C++ Comments    : Allow // type comments in source code

No tmpname()    : Tell vc to not use the tmpnam() function to name
                  temporary files. file.c will be named file.i, file.asm
                  instead of vc_<num>.i and vc_<num>.asm.

FP Associative  : Treat floating point operations as associative.

No Alias Opt    : See vbcc://doc/vbcc.doc

ISO/ANSI        : Switch to ISO/ANSI mode.

Strip Path      : Strip the path of filename in error messages.
