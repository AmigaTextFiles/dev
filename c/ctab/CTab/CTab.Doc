CTab is ShareWare and freely distributable.
That means, CTab may be freely distributed, copied, pushed in FTP-servers
and included on some PD/FD-series (like Fish, TBAG, Tornado, etc.),
as long as no profit is made for the distributor.
The program, the source-code and the (sub-) routines remain copyright by
the author (Alexander Rawass).

If you use CTab regularly (and you will, of course) then you'll have to
send DM 5 (Deutschmark, if you live in EEC) or US$ 5 (if you live in the
rest of the world) to the above address.
You will then become a registered user and will receive the latest versions
of CTab per disk.

Using CTab without being registered is both illegal and immoral!



What is CTab for?
-----------------

CTab is an utility to format C-Source-Codes, to give them a neater
appearance and to make them more easily to read and comprehend.

It insert (depending on the number of open '{' brackets) the needed number
of tabs in the text, thus making the program more structured and easy to
read.

CTab is very useful if you have written your program and then changed it a
little bit, maybe by including some more 'if','while' or 'for'-cases in the
text.


Usage of CTab
-------------

Usage :	CTab <filename> [SPC n]

	<filename> is the name of the C-source-code to format
	the formatted file is written to <filename>.ct

If you call CTab with the 'SPC n' option, CTab inserts n spaces into the
text instead of one single tab (so 'SPC 8' would give your source-code the
same appearance as without the 'SPC'-option.


Compilation & Konfiguration :
-----------------------------

CTab should work on every Amiga with Kickstart V1.2 or higher.

CTab was developed on an Amiga 500 with Kick 1.2 and 1Mb RAM.
It was compiled using Manx Aztec C V5.0a.

Compiler	: cc ctab -bs -qv -mdons -so
Linker		: ln ctab -lc


Example :
---------

VOID main(){
int i;
for(i=0;i<80;i++){
printf("CTAB\n");
if(i==40){ printf("Halbzeit\n"); }
}
Exit(NULL);
}


will become :


VOID main(){
	int i;
	for(i=0;i<80;i++){
		printf("CTAB\n");
		if(i==40){
			printf("Halbzeit\n");
		}
	}
	Exit(NULL);
}


Distribution
------------

CTab is freely distributable ShareWare.

You can copy it as you want, as long as you make no profit from copying.
That means, a disk with CTab on it should not cost more than ca. 3 DM,
which is about US$ 3.

It would be great if CTab would be included on some FD-series, like
Fish, TBAG, Franz, AUGE, Tornado, etc.

Spread CTab as you can, push it in every FTP-server and in every net
you can find, put it in your local mailbox and be happy with it.

But, of course, you may only distribute the COMPLETE CTab.
CTab consists of the following files :

	CTab		- the program
	CTab.Doc	- this documentation
	CTab.ReadMe	- a short readme file
	CTab.Vertrieb	- for german eyes only
	CTab.c		- the source code

If any of the files are missing, CTab may no longer be distributed!

German distributors, read CTab.Vertrieb!
