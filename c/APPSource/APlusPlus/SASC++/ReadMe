Some comments about compiling the A++ Library with the SAS C++ compiler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A++ requests tow logical devices to be declared, "apphome:" and "appinclude:".
"appinclude:" always describes the "apphome:includes" directory while
"apphome:" itself is directed to the "APlusPlus" root directory.
Just start "Assign_A++" to make these assignments.

I recently used SAS C++ V6.51 (great work!).
The SCoptions represented in the scoptions file have shown to produce
a running A++ Library with best optimization.
WARNING: The Peephole Optimizer causes only SignalResponder class not to 
work properly! The SCoptions have set the Peephole Optimized off, but
you can change that. Only be careful NOT to compile "SignalResponder.cxx"
with that option on!

You will need a fast Amiga with at least 6MB.

SMake makefiles have been supplied for both the A++ link library and the
test programs. Just click on the Build icon.

Announcements:
As soon as making a shared library from C++ code becomes easier with SAS®/C++
the A++ Library will become a shared library! Up to now I don't have the time
to rewrite every C++ method with __asm keywords.
There is also a bug in SLink that is already known to SAS which prevents
linking a shared library with those long names which occur with C++.
Probably there will be several shared libraries: one for Intuition, one for
DOS, one for AREXX, one for ...

   Have fun,
