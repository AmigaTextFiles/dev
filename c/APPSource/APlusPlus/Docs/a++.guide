@NODE Introduction


   What is the A++ Library?

   The A++ Library is a library written in C++ that consists of classes
   assigned to the task of encapsulating the Amiga® system software.
   Its aim is to provide a stable and effective method of programming the
   Amiga®. That should include Exec, Dos, Intuition, ARexx, ..just
   everything that makes sense being encapsulated with a proper C++ class
   interface.
   The A++ Library collects the hundreds of system functions, groups them
   into classes that 'know' about the specialities of each function and
   thus shields the programmer from using them incorrectly.
   The C++ programming language provides the object oriented paradigm
   that holds no limitations to evolution of existing solutions.

   The contents of this archive do not represent a complete and ready to
   use tool but the expression of an idea showing promise. It gives only
   a slight impression of what is possible. But much more can be done.


   I hope you may agree with me,

@NODE "How to install the A++ Library.."


   To compile the A++ sources you will need a fast Amiga with at least
   6MB Ram and a hard disk with either the installed GNU-C++ package or
   the SAS® C++ V6.51 package and also the Commodore header files.

   You have unpacked the archive somewhere on your hard disk.
   Now, make the directory where the 'APlusPlus' drawer resides in 'apphome':

      assign apphome: work:
      // assumed 'work:APlusPlus/..' exists

   The makefiles work with 'apphome:'.

   You need to add apphome: to the compiler's include path. For the SAS®
   compiler this is already done in SCoptions.

   For the GNU compiler add '-Iapphome:' on the command line when compiling
   applications.

   Also read the 'ReadMe' files in the SASC++ and GNUC++ directory.

         Have fun!

@NODE "What can I do?"


   The A++ Library is Public Domain as should all programs created under
   usage of the A++ Library be Public Domain.
   The idea is to build up a library that contributes to the prosperity
   of the Amiga software market, that shall gather the abilities and the
   knowledge of the many programmers who have made the Amiga more than
   just another microcomputer.

   To boldly go where Commodore has never gone before..

   So, actually, everyone can participate in this project. Any suggestions,
   ideas, improvements or further visions are welcome!
   I do not expect any money donations but I would be very happy about a
   nice postcard from your hometown as a little greeting.
   EVERYONE who has any interest in this project is asked to show that 
   interest by telling ME, so I can estimate wether sustaining A++ is 
   worth my while. Thank You in advance!

   What comes up in the future..


   I don't know.

   A great deal would be a A++ Class pool in the Public Domain.
   I also think of a Class Browser, Graphical User Interface Builder,
   more abstract OOP layers...what do You think? Send me a mail:

      email to: armin@uni-paderborn.de


   P.S.: I'm already thinking of a GUI Builder that can use your own
         GUI classes as easy as the ones I implemented so far.
