Some comments about compiling the A++ Library with the GNU C++ compiler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A++ requests tow logical devices to be declared, "apphome:" and "appinclude:".
"appinclude:" usually describes the "apphome:includes" directory while
"apphome:" itself is directed to the "APlusPlus" root directory.
Just start "Assign_A++" to make these assignments.

I recently used GNU C++ 2.6.0 and it works fine. 

Especially with the GNU compiler you will need a fast Amiga with at least 6MB.
But DON'T get the idea to optimize with only 6MB. Either get yourself more
RAM or a virtual memory manager (available in the Public Domain).

A compiled version can be found in the A++GNU_bin.lha archive that should
be available at the same place where you got this one.

Makefiles for GNUMake have been provided. To start the Make just click on 
the Build icons which use IconX to activate Make.



The GNU2SCMSG utility (only for SAS/C® users)
---------------------------------------------

With the AREXX script "gnutoscmsg" which is executed by clicking GNU2SCMSG
I created a way to direct the GNU error output to the SAS® SCMSG browser.
You only have to make sure that the gcc output is redirected into
"pipe:gnu_errors". On the CLI simply use

   gcc <parameterlist> >pipe:gnu_errors

For some reason this does not work with the GNUMake which uses "sh" to
execute a command from the makefile. (I checked it out: only the gcc command
together with the "sh" shell fails to redirect its output properly!?)

OF COURSE, the SCMSG program is not distributed with A++ since it is part of
the SAS/C® Development System!
