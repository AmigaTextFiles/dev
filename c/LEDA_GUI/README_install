Hello LEDA users.

    This  is  my second version of the Wx library for the LEDA package.  It
has nearly the same functionality as the X11 version, except for some small
shortcomings. Read README.LEDA if you don't know where to obtain LEDA.

    What  you  need  to use this package is:  a current version of LEDA.  I
still  use  Version  3.1.1  since  I  have  some  problems compiling 3.1.2,
apparently  due  to  lack  of  memory.   Versions  prior to 3.1.1 need many
changes  to  compile  on an Amiga, so using them is discouraged.  LEDA is a
big  library,  most  programs  will  require about 9 MB to compile, and the
stack  must  be  set  to 500000, the default 350000 will not suffice in all
cases.


INSTALLATION:

    I'll  keep  this part short.  since you are a programmer, you know what
to  do  here.   The Assigns are just for easy reference here and not needed
after installation. NOTE: you must edit the <...> below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
assign LEDA: <whatever>:LEDA-3.1.2
assign HERE: ""
;
; save original files
;
cd LEDA:incl/LEDA
rename basic.h basic.h.orig
cd LEDA:prog
rename Make.pro Make.pro.orig
cd LEDA:src
rename Make.src Make.src.orig
rename Makefile Makefile.orig
;
; adding new files (you may check out the archive first)
;
cd LEDA:
lha x HERE:files.lha
;
; now edit ENV_LEDAGUI to suit your needs
;
cd LEDA:src/amiga
<your_editor> ENV_LEDAGUI
copy ENV_LEDAGUI ENV:LEDAGUI
copy ENV_LEDAGUI ENVARC:LEDAGUI
makedir usr:lib/X11
copy X11_RGB usr:lib/X11/rgb.txt
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The  ready-made  "libWx.a"  is compiled with "-m68030 -m68881 -O2".  If
you  want different settings, you will have to edit "LEDA:src/Make.src" and
"LEDA:prog/Make.pro",  and  compile  again:   "cd  LEDA:src/amiga", "make".
Before  trying to compile please have a look into the Makefile, to check if
you have all the required utilitites, e.g.  sed.


USAGE:

    Just  proceed  as stated in the LEDA docs, but replace all "-lWx -lX11"
by  "-lWx".   This  may  be  the  case  for some Makefiles in the LEDA:prog
subdirectories, e.g.  LEDA:prog/window/makefile.


THE PREFERENCE FILE:

    The  prefs file has a very primitive design to keep the parsing simple.
So  you  must not edit anything except the characters between the pipe sign
("|") and the end-of-line.

Screen Width              |1024
Screen Height             |768
Screen Depth [5,...,8]    |6
Screen ModeID             |PICASSO:1024x768
Screen Overscan [OSCAN_*] |1
Screen AutoScroll         |0
Text Font Name            |courier.font
Text Font Size            |13
Text Font Style           |0
Bold Font Name            |courier.font
Bold Font Size            |13
Bold Font Style [FSF_*]   |1
Message Font Name         |courier.font
Message Font Size         |15
Message Font Style        |0
X11 Color Base            |usr:lib/X11/rgb.txt
Picasso Workaround (0,1)  |1

    Note  that  LEDA  generally  requires a relatively high resolution, for
example  the  default  window size is 700*700 Pixel.  The ModeID must match
exactly,  use  the  "ScreenMode"  preference  program  for  reference.  The
Overscan values can be one of:

#define OSCAN_TEXT	(1)	/* entirely visible	*/
#define OSCAN_STANDARD	(2)	/* just past edges	*/
#define OSCAN_MAX	(3)	/* as much as possible	*/
#define OSCAN_VIDEO	(4)	/* even more than is possible	*/

The Font Style can be one of:

#define	FS_NORMAL	0	/* normal text (no style bits set) */
#define	FSF_UNDERLINED	0x01
#define	FSF_BOLD	0x02
#define	FSF_ITALIC	0x04

The  X11  Color  Base  may  be put whereever you want, but I think that the
specified directory is a standard location under Unix.


FEATURES & LIMITATIONS:

    Most  functions  are  correctly emulated, including line dash patterns,
X11 style color selection, window events, timing functions.  However, there
are some X11 features that are not easily emulated:

 - Thick lines. I use a bunch of normal lines to imitate this, but it
   may look ugly in exor-mode, or with a dash pattern.
 - Dashed arcs. I use normal arcs instead
 - Bitmap insertions. I didn't have the time to write PBM import routines.
 - Iconification is not supported

    Since  many  LEDA programs make extensive use of all 3 mouse buttons, I
have  mapped F1, F2, F3 to LMB, MMB, RMB, respectively, for the ones of you
with only 2 button mice.


DISCLAIMER & COPYRIGHT:

    Standard disclaimer applies:  Use entirely at your own risk.  Please do
not redistribute modified parts of this archive.


FUTURE:

    This  version  works  quite  fine for me.  I currently write my diploma
thesis  on  my  Amiga,  and  compile  it on some SunOS SparcStations at the
university without ANY changes or "#ifdef AMIGA"s at all (!)

    If  you  want  some  new functions implemented or have any suggestions,
criticism, please write to:
