		SAS/C Rexx Interface V1.00 - Manual


NAME
	LC:SRI

SYNOPSIS
	SRI

DESCRIPTION
	SRI is an interface to use any editor with ARexx Interface with
	SAS-C 5.10a or newer. The original interface suplied with SAS for CED
	isn't very smart so I wrote a new one. Because one of my friends is a
	"UEdit" fan, I rewrote it for use with any editor.

REQUIREMENTS
	A-Rexx V1.10 or newer, SAS-C 5.10a or newer and of course an editor
	with ...

INSTALLATION
	Copy "bin/SRI" to your "LC:" directory. If ARexx scripts for your
	Editor are supplied with SRI use them, else write some and send them
	to me !
	Type "SetEnv SASCOPTS -E -ja" and "LC:SRI" at your CLI prompt.
	If you now compile a program and LC finds an error, the file will be
	loaded into your editor and the first error will be displayed in a
	requester. To get the second error send a "NE" (for Next Error) to
	SRI's ARexx Interface (use "ADDRESS 'SRI' NE").
	To install SRI permanently put the two lines from above in your
	"Startup-Sequence". You should also install the next error command
	somehow in your editor. "Cygnus Ed Professional" users can't e.g.
	install the supplied script "NextError.ced" on a function key.

REXXSCRIPTS
	To use any editor with SRI you need two rexx scripts:
	- "SRIOpen.rexx"
	  This script is used to load a source file into the editor,
	  the filename is supplied as argument.
	- "SRIShowError.rexx"
	  This script is used to show a compilation error. Two arguments are
	  supplied:
	  - line number of the error location
	    The first line is no. 1 ! If line number is zero, no "goto line"
	    should be performed.
	  - the error message
	    This is the error message generated by the compiler. Show it in
	    any way.

SOURCE
	The source code is included, it can be compiled with SAS-C 5.10a or
	newer.

THANKS
	Many thanks to the authors of SAS-C 5.10a and Cygnus Ed Professional
	for their great work.
