empty-handler
-------------

little  filehandler  for  creating  empty  files of any given length.  just
mount it via the provided mountlist:

   mount empty: from empty.mountlist

then  you  can use an Open("EMPTY:<filelength_in_bytes>",...) to get a file
of length <filelength_in_bytes> filled up with lots of zeros...

e.g.

   copy empty:424242 ram:x

will create a empty file of 424242 bytes in your ram-disk.
