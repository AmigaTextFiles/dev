@Node "DependantScan Introduction"
@keywords introduction description MakeFile

   @{u}DependantScan@{uu} is a program for use by Amiga C programmers. If you do not program in C, @{u}DependantScan@{uu} will be of little use to you.

   The @{u}DependantScan@{uu} utility creates @{" MakeFiles " Link "MakeFile"}. @{u}DependantScan@{uu} examines the C source code files in a project to determine which header files the source code files are dependant on, and generates a MakeFile with the determined relationships.

   With @{u}DependantScan@{uu}, a C developer no longer needs to edit their MakeFiles after a changing the source code to include another header file. Instead, the C developer merely runs @{u}DependantScan@{uu} and the MakeFile containing the new dependency information is automatically generated.

   This program was written as a side project when I became tired of manually maintaining my own MakeFiles. I tried several utilities from the @{" AmiNet " Link "AmiNet"} and the @{u}mkmk@{uu} utility from SAS/C, but none of them worked as I wanted. And thus, @{u}DependantScan@{uu} was born.

@Node "AmiNet"
@keywords AmiNet internet software CD-ROM

   The AmiNet is a portion of the Internet which contains gigabytes of free Amiga software for the taking. If you don't have access to the Internet, the software can also be purchased on CD-ROMs from various Amiga software vendors.

@Node "MakeFile"
@keywords MakeFile header file

   If you write in C and do not use MakeFiles, use them.

   With regard to C programming, the most common use of MakeFiles (or in SAS/C's case SmakeFiles) are to only compile those source code modules that need to be compiled. For example, if there are 10 source code files in a project and you edit one of them, then just that one file should be re-compiled thus saving the compile time of the other nine source code modules.

   In a similar manner, if you make a change to one of the header files #included by a source code module, the source code module should also be re-compiled.

   @{u}DependantScan@{uu} automates the process of creating and maintaining MakeFiles. Using MakeFiles generated by @{u}DependantScan@{uu} can be easier than not using MakeFiles at all.

   @{b}It can be dangerous not to use MakeFiles!@{ub} Consider the case where a programmer edits a header file but does not re-compile all of the source code modules that use the header file. If one of the non-compiled source code modules uses some of the edited data, the result is a program that in most cases will behave strangely. @{fg highlight}This can easily happen when using the MAKE switch of SAS/C or using SAS/C's Build icon with no MakeFile.@{fg text}

   The name of the MakeFile created by @{u}DependantScan@{uu} is controlled with the @{" Makefile/S " Link "MakeFile Option"} and @{" MAKEFILE= " Link "MakeFile Option"} options.

   The MakeFiles created by @{u}DependantScan@{uu} use relative file paths and are designed to be processed with the projects @{" path " Link "Path Option"} as the current directory.

@Node "Features & Limitations"
@keywords feature limitation DICE from with to library link

   * @{u}DependantScan@{uu} is Executable from the WorkBench or the CLI. All @{" command-line options " Link "Options"} are available as @{" tool types " Link "Options"} in an icon.

   * Although written for use with SAS/C, the @{" MakeFiles " Link "MakeFile"} created by @{u}DependantScan@{uu} may (but I doubt it) be compatible with DICE, UNIX make, and/or Manx C.

   * Only a single project and set of compile options are allowed per MakeFile.

   * @{u}DependantScan@{uu} does not scan assembly files. But, assembly object files can be included in a project with the use of the @{" FROM " Link "From Option"} keyword/tool type.

   * #include files (header files) that are included by other header files are not supported.

   * Projects with source code in multiple directories must conform to the proper @{" development model " Link "Development Model"}.

   * @{u}DependantScan@{uu} creates the MakeFile with the assumption that the linker supports the FROM, WITH, TO and LIBRARY keywords in the same manner as SAS/C's development system. If your C development system doesn't support these keywords, you will have to either edit the @{" source code " Link "Source Code"} or contact @{" the author " Link "Ray Darrah III"} concerning how your linker works.

   Other limitations can be found in the @{" Development Model " Link "Development Model"}. Please contact @{" the author " Link "Ray Darrah III"} with your favorite(?) limitation and he will consider removing it.
@EndNode

@Node "DependantScan Installation"
@ keywords install installation

   Installation of @{u}DependantScan@{uu} can be accomplished with the following steps:

   * Copy the @{u}DependantScan@{uu} program to some place in your @{" path " Link "Path Option"}.

   * If you prefer to use the icon-based compilation system devised by SAS/C, I suggest that you move the @{u}Scanner.info@{uu} example project to your @{u}sc:starter_project@{uu} directory. That way, the @{u}scsetup@{uu} program will automatically put the icon in your new project directories.

   * The archive is an image of this branch of my @{" development tree " Link "Development Model"} and therefore can be copied as-is to your development tree if you wish to preserve/use the @{" source code " Link "Source Code"}.
@EndNode

@Node "Development Model"
@keywords development model directory style feature limitation

   In order for @{u}DependantScan@{uu} to work properly, certain restrictions must be placed upon your C development system and the way you code. I hope that most people will not find these restrictions too limiting.

   * All the @{" source code " Link "Source Code"} files necessary to build a project must appear to be in the same directory - or in sub-directories off of a directory. The AmigaDOS @{u}MakeLink@{uu} command may be used to have it appear as if source code files from other directories actually appear in the same directory.

   * All #include statements in source code files that reference standard Amiga header files or compiler header files should be in angle brackets. Example: @{b}#include <stdio.h>@{ub}.

   * All other #include statements must use quotation marks. Example @{b}#include "DependantScan.h"@{ub}.

   * @{u}DependantScan@{uu} will search sub-directories off of the root @{" path " Link "Path Option"}. So, any source code modules found in these sub-directories will also be included in the @{" MakeFile " Link "MakeFile"}.

@Node "Options"
@keywords arguments tool types parameters options

   All of @{u}DependantScan@{uu} options are available either command-line parameters or Tool Types.

   @{" FilesOnLine/N/K FILESONLINE= " Link "FilesOnLine Option"}  - number of files per MakeFile line
   @{" From/K FROM= " Link "From Option"}       - linker object files

   N=FilesOnLine/N/K - as a @{" CLI argument " Link "Options"}
   FILESONLINE=      - as a @{" Tool Type " Link "Options"} (from WorkBench)

   @{b}Default Examples:@{ub}
   N 5         - from the CLI
   filesonline 5  - from the CLI
   FILESONLINE=5  - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter is used primarily to change the human readability of the @{" MakeFile " Link "MakeFile"}. It sets the maximum number of dependant files that appear on any one line of the MakeFile.
@EndNode

@Node "From Option"
@keywords from FROM= option startup link

   From/K   - as a @{" CLI argument " Link "Options"}
   FROM= - as a @{" Tool Type " Link "Options"} (from WorkBench)

   @{b}Default Examples:@{ub}
   from "LIB:c.o" - from the CLI
   FROM=LIB:c.o      - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter changes what is put after the linker's FROM keyword in the link section of the @{" MakeFile " Link "MakeFile"}. If a project has non-standard startup code or no startup code at all, this parameter will have to be specified. Also, this parameter may be used to include object files that are not compiled with the output MakeFile.

   @{b}Default Examples:@{ub}
   lib "lib:sc.lib + lib:amiga.lib" - from the CLI
   library "lib:sc.lib + lib:amiga.lib"   - from the CLI
   LIBRARY=lib:sc.lib + lib:amiga.lib  - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter specifies the first text that follows the linker's LIBRARY keyword. It is typically used to change the libraries that a project is linked with.

   mk "SMakeFile" - from the CLI
   makefile SMakeFile   - from the CLI
   MAKEFILE=SmakeFile   - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter specifies the name of the @{" MakeFile " Link "MakeFile"} that @{u}DependantScan@{uu} will create.
@EndNode

@Node "Match Option"
@keywords Match MATCH= option source code files

   Match/K  - as a @{" CLI argument " Link "Options"}
   MATCH=   - as a @{" Tool Type " Link "Options"} (from WorkBench)

   @{b}Default Examples:@{ub}
   match "#?.c"   - from the CLI
   MATCH=#?.c  - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter specifies the files to be scanned by {u}DependantScan@{uu}. The program does not need to scan the header files in your @{" development model " Link "Development Model"}.
@EndNode

@Node "Object_Dir Option"
@keywords Object_Dir object dir option output files

   Obj=Object_Dir/K  - as a @{" CLI argument " Link "Options"}
   OBJECT_DIR=    - as a @{" Tool Type " Link "Options"} (from WorkBench)

   @{b}Default Examples:@{ub}
   obj "Object/"  - from the CLI
   object_dir Object/   - from the CLI
   OBJECT_DIR=Object/   - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter specifies the directory where the object files will be located for the compile. A trailing slash (@{b}/@{ub}) or colon (@{b}:@{ub}) is required. The default listed above is slightly misleading because if this option is not specified, @{u}DependantScan@{uu} will attempt to retrieve the value from the @{u}SCOPTIONS@{uu} file in the project's @{" path " Link "Path Option"}. The @{u}SCOPTIONS@{uu} file is usually edited with the @{u}SCOpts@{uu} program (the scoptions icon) in the SAS/C @{" development model " Link "Development Model"}.

   It is recommended that you put object files compiled with different options in different directories. The @{u}SCOptions.Normal@{uu} and @{u}SCOptions.Debug@{uu} files in this archive demonstrate how you can use the @{" IconJ " Link "IconJ Program"} program to easily switch between different compile options.
@EndNode

@Node "Path Option"

   PATH= - as a @{" Tool Type " Link "Options"} (from WorkBench)

   @{b}Examples:@{ub}
   path Work:C - from the CLI
   PATH=Work:C - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter specifies the root directory of the @{" development model " Link "Development Model"} i.e. where to look to find @{" source code " Link "Source Code"} files. The default for this option is the current directory (from the CLI) or the directory belonging to the icon (when ran from the WorkBench). @{u}DependantScan@{uu} will process all files that match the @{" Match/K MATCH= " Link "Match Option"} file specification in this directory and it's sub-directories.
@EndNode

@Node "Project Option"
@keywords Project option executable product

   Project/K   - as a @{" CLI argument " Link "Options"}
   PROJECT= - as a @{" Tool Type " Link "Options"} (from WorkBench)

   @{b}Default Examples:@{ub}
   project "Executable" - from the CLI
   PROJECT=Executable   - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter specifies the primary object that the @{" MakeFile " Link "MakeFile"} will make. If this option is not specified, @{u}DependantScan@{uu} will attempt to retrieve the value from the @{u}SCOPTIONS@{uu} file in the project's @{" path " Link "Path Option"}. If the parameter cannot be retrieved from @{u}SCOPTIONS@{uu} file, the default will be "Executable", as illustrated above. Typically, this is the name of the program that you are working on.
@EndNode

@Node "Rules Option"
@keywords Rules option

   Rules/K  - as a @{" CLI argument " Link "Options"}
   RULES=   - as a @{" Tool Type " Link "Options"} (from WorkBench)

   @{b}Examples:@{ub}
   rules "Compile.rules"   - from the CLI
   RULES=Compile.rules     - from the WorkBench

   This optional parameter specifies the name of a file to be inserted at the top of the @{" MakeFile " Link "MakeFile"}. By default, no file will be inserted. This may be useful if you are using a different compiler and/or make program.

   This optional switch is supplied when you want @{u}DependantScan@{uu} to display additional information about the process and to present a requester at the end of the operation.
@EndNode

@Node "Source Code"
@keywords source code compile

   The @{u}DependantScan@{uu} source code supplied in this archive is only availble from the CLI. It can be found in the @{u}Source@{uu} directory.

   As supplied, you should be able to re-compile @{u}DependantScan@{uu} by clicking on the @{u}SCOptions.Normal@{uu} or @{u}SCOptions.Debug@{uu} icons to select the compile mode and then by typing @{b}Smakeg@{ub} from the CLI while in the @{u}source@{uu} directory.

   Information about how to make an application's source code compatible with @{u}DependantScan@{uu} can be found in the @{" Development Model " Link "Development Model"} section.

@Node "IconJ Program"
@keywords IconJ program iconj

   The @{u}IconJ@{uu} program is a public domain utility that acts very much like the IconX program that comes with AmigaDOS. However, the IconJ program can read the script lines to execute from the tool types of an icon. The @{u}SCOptions.Normal@{uu} and @{u}SCOptions.Debug@{uu} icons provided demonstrate how one can use this utility to quickly switch between compile options.
