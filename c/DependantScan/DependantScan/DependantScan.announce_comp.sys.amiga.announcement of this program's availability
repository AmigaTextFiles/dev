DESCRIPTION
   The DependantScan program is designed for use by programmers using the
SAS/C development package. It generates and maintains MakeFiles compatible
with the SMake program which comes with that development package. By using
DependantScan and SMake, a C programmer ensures that all source code files
that must be compiled, and only the source code that needs to be compiled,
is compiled after each editing session.

Important Features
   * Usable from the WorkBench as well as the CLI
   * All options available as tool-types and CLI arguments
