Hi
I have writen this program, because my friends ask me. I don't know, 
but maybe You need some of this function. You can use it, but if you could
send me info about it, i be happy :)) 

This program sorting text files. To use it You ought to type:

TKLSort FROM=_name1_ TO=_name2_ INDEX=_indexfile_ NRKOL=_nr_

_name1_      - the name of sorting file.
_name2_      - the name of destynation file
_indexfile_  - the name with index file. You do not use this parametr. 
               Default is BlaBla.tkx
_nr_         - the number of kolumn, witch you use to sorting. Default 
               is 0.

Sorry for my poor English.
