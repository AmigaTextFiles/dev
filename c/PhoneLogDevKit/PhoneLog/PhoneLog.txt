Description
-----------

It seems that there was no standard for log files that are used
to log modem connections etc. As you can see programs like PhoneBill (by
Raymond Penners) support very much different log file formats.
So I decided to create a standard based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
Language) which is defined in ISO8879 and on ISO8601 which defines date/time
representations.

SGML uses the ASCII characterset as base, so it can be used on every
platform. On the other hand SGML gives the log file a real structure
that is defined by the DTD (Document Type Definition).

The advantage of using SGML is that these log files have a structure, so they
can be easily interchanged with other SGML applications like databases,
wordprocessors or calculation software.

By supporting this standard with your software you give the user the
possibility to create or evaluate log files with software from
different platforms; and you get a standard that is easily extended
should a need occur.

To make this standard widely used, I provide a generator and a parser for
this log file standard for free!


Implementation
--------------

The format of PhoneLog log files is defined by the DTD that you can find in
the SGML directory - there you will also find an example of a log file
(PhoneLog.sgm) and a EBNF.

For those of you who are not familar with SGML I will try to explain the
basics:

In the DTD the elements for a document type will be defined. Normally all
elements have a start-tag and an end-tag.

<!ELEMENT PHONELOG	- O ((ENTRY | MARK)*)>

descibes the element <PHONELOG> that consist of zero or more elements of the
type <ENTRY>...</ENTRY> or <MARK>...</MARK>.

Each element can consist of other subelements or it is a final element that
contains character data (CDATA).
If an element has subelements, these will be defined as follows:

() : Expressions within a group are treated as a unit for other operations.
,  : All of the connected elements must occur in the same sequence as defined.
|  : One and only one of the connected elements must occur.
*  : Unit can occur 0 or more times.
?  : Unit can occur 0 or 1 time.

Optional some elements may have their own attributes:

<!ATTLIST PHONELOG	version		NUMBER	1
			revision	NUMBER	2>

<PHONELOG> means that the defined default version/revision will be used.
<PHONELOG version=1 revision=5> defines version/revision 1.5.


A log-file entry can be freely formated:

<ENTRY><HOST><NUMBER>2187550</NUMBER></HOST><START><DATE>1995-02-15</DATE><TIME>16:30:00</TIME></START><END><TIME>17:45:10</TIME></END></ENTRY>


<ENTRY>
<HOST><NUMBER>2187550</NUMBER></HOST>
<START><DATE>1995-02-15</DATE><TIME>16:30:00</TIME></START>
<END><TIME>17:45:10</TIME></END>
</ENTRY>


<ENTRY>
<HOST>
<NUMBER>
2187550
</NUMBER>
</HOST>
<START>
<DATE>
1995-02-15
</DATE>
<TIME>
16:30:00
</TIME>
</START>
<END>
<TIME>
17:45:10
</TIME>
</END>
</ENTRY>


But this formating is preferred:

<ENTRY>
  <HOST>
    <NUMBER>2187550</NUMBER>
  </HOST>
  <START>
    <DATE>1995-02-15</DATE>
    <TIME>16:30:00</TIME>
  </START>
  <END>
    <TIME>17:45:10</TIME>
  </END>
</ENTRY>


The format for date/time is taken from ISO8601 and has the following form:

Time  : hh:mm:ss
Date  : yyyy-mm-dd
Period: hhHmmMssS


Hopefully this is enought information for you to understand the format.
For questions please feel free to send email.
