Generator and parser to write and read phone log files in SGML format
.description
It seems that there was no standard for log files that are used
to log modem connections etc. As you can see programs like PhoneBill (by
Raymond Penners) support very much different log file formats.
So I decided to create a standard based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
Language) which is defined in ISO8879 and on ISO8601 which defines date/time
representations.

SGML uses the ASCII characterset as base, so it can be used on every
platform. On the other hand SGML gives the log file a real structure
that is defined by the DTD (Document Type Definition).

The advantage of using SGML is that these log files have a structure, so they
can be easily interchanged with other SGML applications like databases,
wordprocessors or calculation software.

By supporting this standard with your software you give the user the
possibility to create or evaluate log files with software from
different platforms; and you get a standard that is easily extended
should a need occur.

To make this standard widely used, I provide a generator and a parser for
this log file standard for free!
