The RevCo installation script requires Commodore's standard Installer utility.
Since Installer is copyrighted by Commodore it is not included with RevCo.

If you have Workbench 2.1, 3.0 or higher you will find Installer on your
Workbench installation disk. Simply copy it to your C: directory
(or anywhere in your Shell command path).

I'm sorry about this inconvenience.

PS: Read the documentation to find out how you can install RevCo manually.
