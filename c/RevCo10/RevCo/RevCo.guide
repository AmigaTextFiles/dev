@node Introduction

   RevCo  is  a small utility to control versions and revisions of C programs.
It  can be run from the shell only and looks a lot like all the other revision
bumpers already available.
   Why  would  you  use  RevCo  instead of any other revision bumper?  Well...
RevCo  is  a very simple yet flexible utility that has all the features I like
in a revision bumper.
   It  generates  an  include  file  (.h)  in  which  it  stores the following
information about a C program :

   - name string
   - version number
   - revision number
   - compilation number
   - subrevision character
   - stage (alpha, beta, public)
   - date string
   - time string
   - AmigaDOS version string

@endnode

@node SysReq "System Requirements"

RevCo requires :

   - AmigaOS Release 2.04 (V37+)

@endnode

@node Installation

To install RevCo just double-click the Install icon.

   or

You can install RevCo manually :

   -  Copy RevCo to a directory in your path (e.g. C:)

   -  Copy RevCo.prefs to ENV: and ENVARC:

   -  Copy this doc to your favourite docs directory

@endnode

@node Usage

RevCo can be run from the shell only.

@{b}Template :@{ub}
   RevCo <filename> [VERSION|REVISION|SUBREVISION|COMPILATION]
                     [STAGE ALPHA|BETA|PUBLIC]

"<filename>_rev.h"  will be created if it doesn't exist.  If it does exist, it
will be updated according to the specified options :

   - sets the date to the current date

   - sets the time to the current time

   - COMPILATION increases the compilation number

   - SUBREVISION increases the subrevision character

   - REVISION increases the revision number and resets the subrevision
      character and compilation number

   - VERSION increases version number and resets the revision number, the
      subrevision character and compilation number

   - STAGE  changes  the stage string to the default string for the specified
      stage (ALPHA, BETA or PUBLIC)

The  file  @{"RevCo.prefs" link Prefs}  in  the  ENV:   directory can be used to customize the
generated strings.

Look at the @{"example" link Example} to see how you can use RevCo in a makefile.

@endnode

@node Prefs

The  file "ENV:RevCo.prefs" defines how the revision file will be updated.  It
contains  lines  with options and values - in the form <OPTION> <VALUE> -, and
comments.   Comments  must  be  preceeded  with  a semicolon.  If an option is
missing, the default value will be taken.  The 'RevCo.prefs' example delivered
with the package reflects the default settings.

@{b}VERSION <n>@{ub}
   The version number will be set to n when a new version file is created.

@{b}REVISION <n>@{ub}
   The  revision number will be set to n when a new version file is created or
when the version number is bumped.

@{b}COMPILATION<n>@{ub}
   The  compilation number will be set to n when a new version file is created
or when the revision number is bumped.

@{b}STAGE_ALPHA [<string>]@{ub}
   The stage string will be set to <string> when the stage is bumped to ALPHA.

@{b}STAGE_BETA [<string>]@{ub}
   The stage string will be set to <string> when the stage is bumped to BETA.

@{b}STAGE_PUBLIC [<string>]@{ub}
   The  stage  string  will  be  set  to  <string> when the stage is bumped to
PUBLIC.

@endnode

@node Example

When you use Revco in the following way you will have a version string in your
program  that can be checked by the DOS command "Version" and you'll also have
the correct compilation date and number available so you can use these in your
code.

@{b}Test.c :@{ub}

...
#include <Test_rev.h>
...
char	MyVersion[] = VERSTAG ;
...

@{b}makefile :@{ub}

CC = sc
OBJS = Test.o

.c.o:
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $*.c

Test:	Date $(OBJS)
	$(CC) LINK $(OBJS)
	RevCo Test COMPILATION

Date:
	RevCo Test

Public:
	RevCo Test STAGE PUBLIC

Revision:
	RevCo Test REVISION
