This chapter will shortly describe how you can print out the
documents, and put them together into a manual.

1. Print out the document "Contents.doc" which is placed in
   the directory "Appendix" on this disk. It should be placed
   first in the manual.

2. As you have noticed, each chapter is put into a directory
   together with its examples. There exist for the moment 11
   chapters (0 - 10) which each should be printed out.

3. If you want you can print out the pictures (the files which
   are put in this directory and have a ".pic" extension), and
   put each picture in front of corresponding chapter.

4. After the last chapter (10 Sprites) should the documents in
   directory "Appendix" be placed.
