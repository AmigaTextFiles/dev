A.1  SCREENS

Example1
  This program will open a low-resolution, non-Interlaced,
  eight colour Custom Screen. It will display it for 30
  seconds, and then close it.

Example2
  Same as Example1 except that the screen will be a high-
  resolution, Interlaced, 4 colour Custom Screen.

Example3
  Same as Example1 except that we will use the TOPAZ_SIXTY
  Italic style as default font. (See chapter 3 GRAPHICS for
  more information about text styles.)

Example4
  This program will open two screens, one (low-resolution 32
  colours) at the top of the display, and one (high-resolution
  16 colours) a bit down.

Example5
  Same as Example4 except that after 10 seconds the low-
  resolution screen will move down 75 lines. After another 10
  seconds it will be put in front of all other screens. 10
  seconds later it will move down another 75 lines. The program
  will wait 10 seconds before the screens are closed and the
  program exits.

Example6
  This program will open a low-resolution, non-Interlaced, 4
  colour Custom Screen. It will after 5 seconds start to change
  the screens colours, and will after a while close the screen
  and exit.



A.2  WINDOWS

Example1
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. It will display it for 30 seconds, and
  then close it.

Example2
  This program will open a high resolution 16 colour Custom
  Screen and a normal window which is connected to it. It will
  display it for 30 seconds, and then close the Custom Screen
  and the window.

Example3
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System Gadgets,
  and will automatically Activate the window. It will display
  it for 30 seconds, and then close it. (Remember that the
  Close Gadget does NOT close the window by itself, it will
  only inform you that the user wants to close it. But in
  this example we will not listen to what the user wants.)

Example4
  This program will open two normal windows which are connected
  to the Workbench Screen. The windows will use all System
  Gadgets. It will display them for 30 seconds, and then close
  them.

Example5
  This program will open a Borderless window which is connected
  to the Workbench Screen. It will display it for 30 seconds,
  and then quit.

Example6
  Same as Example5 except that the window will also use all
  System Gadgets.

Example7
  This program will open three windows, two are normal and the
  third is a Backdrop window. The windows will use all System
  Gadgets, except the Backdrop window, which only can use the
  close-window gadget. After 30 seconds the program quits. (Try
  to push either window 1 or 2 behind the Backdrop window.)

Example8
  This program will open a SuperBitMap window which is
  connected to the Workbench Screen. Since it is a SuperBitMap
  we also make the window into a Gimmezerozero window. The
  window will use all System Gadgets, and some boxes will be
  drawn. It will display the window for 30 seconds, and then
  close it. (Shrink the window, and then enlarge it again, and
  you will noticed that the lines are still there!)

Example9
  This program will open a normal window with all system
  gadgets connected to it. If you activate the window, the
  pointer will change shapes into a "nice" arrow.

Example10
  This program will open a two normal windows with all system
  gadgets connected to them. If the first window is Activated,
  the pointer will change shapes into a Zzz symbol, if the
  second window is activated, the pointer will look like a
  pistol.



A.3  GRAPHICS

Example1
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. We will then draw a strange line with
  help of Intuition's Border structure.

Example2
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. We will then draw two rectangles with
  different colours. This shows how you can link Border
  structures to each other in order to get the desired effects.

Example3
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. We will then print a text string with
  help of Intuition's IntuiText structure.

Example4
  Same as Example3 except that the text will be printed with
  underlined italic characters.

Example5
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. We will then draw the little nice arrow
  we talked so much about.

Example6
  Same as Example5 except that we will draw it several times in
  different colours. This shows how PlanePick/PlaneOnOff works.

Example7
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. We will then draw the nice 4 colour
  face that was described in chapter 3.5 IMAGES.

Example8
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  a 16-colour Custom screen. In the window we will draw the
  famous AMIGA-logo.



A.4  GADGETS

Example1
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System
  Gadgets, and will close first when the user has selected the
  System gadget Close window. (Same as Example3 in chapter 2
  WINDOWS, except that we have added an IDCMP check on the
  Close window gadget.)

Example2
  Same as Example1 except that we have added a Boolean gadget
  with the text "PRESS ME".

Example3
  Same as Example2 except that the on/off state of the gadget
  is toggled each time the user hits the gadget.

Example4
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System
  Gadgets, and will close first when the user has selected
  the System gadget Close window. Inside the window we have put
  two Boolean gadgets with the text "GADGET 1" and "GADGET 2".

Example5
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System Gadgets,
  and will close first when the user has selected the System
  gadget Close window. Inside the window we have put a Boolean
  gadget with two Image structures connected to it. Each time
  the user clicks on the gadget it will change images, lamp
  on/lamp off.

Example6
  This program will open a normal window which is connected
  to the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System
  Gadgets, and will close first when the user has selected the
  System gadget Close window. Inside the window we have put a
  Boolean gadget with a connecting mask. The gadget will only
  be highlighted when the user selects this gadget while
  pointing inside the specified (masked) area.

Example7
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System
  Gadgets, and will close first when the user has selected the
  System gadget Close window. Inside the window we have put a
  String gadget.

Example8
  Same as Example7 except that it is an Integer gadget.

Example9
  Same as Example7 except that it is a Proportional gadget.

Example10
  Same as Example9 except that the Proportional gadget uses a
  custom image knob.

Example11
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System
  Gadgets, and will close first when the user has selected the
  System gadget Close window. Inside the window we have put a
  Proportional gadget where the knob can be moved both
  horizontally and vertically.

Example12
  This program will open a SuperBitmap window which is
  connected to the Workbench Screen. The window will use all
  System Gadgets, and will close first when the user has
  selected the System gadget Close window. Inside the window we
  have put two Proportional gadgets, one on the right side, and
  one at the bottom. With help of these two gadgets, the user
  can move around the BitMap.

  This example is for experienced programmers only, since it
  uses some functions etc which we have not discussed yet. I
  have, however, included it here since it is a good example on
  how you can combine Proportional gadgets with SuperBitmap
  windows.



A.5  REQUESTERS

Example1
  This example opens a Simple requester by calling the function
  AutoRequest. It displays a message "This is a very simple
  requester!", and has only one gadget connected to it (on the
  right side of the requester) with the text "OK".

Example2
  Same as Example1, except that the requester displays a
  message "Do you really want to quit?", and allows the user to
  choose between "Yes" and "No". The program  will continue to
  reopen the requester until the user has chosen "Yes".

Example3
  Same as Example1, except that this requester displays a
  message "Insert a disk in any drive!", and allows the user to
  choose between "Yes" and "No". The program will continue to
  reopen the requester until the user has chosen "Yes" or
  inserted a disk.

Example4
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System Gadgets,
  and will close first when the user has selected the System
  gadget Close window. Inside the window we have activated an
  Application requester with a connecting gadget. The requester
  will first be satisfied when the user has selected the
  gadget, and will then be deactivated. The window can now be
  closed.

Example5
  Same as Example4, except that the requester is first
  activated when the user double-clicks on the right mouse
  button. This example shows how to create a Double-menu
  requester, and how to monitor the IDCMP flags REQSET and
  REQCLEAR.

Example6
  Same as Example5, except that whenever the user double-
  clicks on the right mouse button, we will receive a REQVERIFY
  message, and first when we have replied, will the requester
  be activated. This example shows how to use the REQVERIFY
  flag.

Example7
  This program will open a normal window which is connected to
  the Workbench Screen. The window will use all System Gadgets,
  and will close first when the user has selected the System
  gadget Close window. Inside the window we have activated an
  Application requester with three connecting gadgets. Two are
  Boolean gadgets ("OK and "CANCEL"), and one is a String
  gadget.

Example8
  Same as Example7, except that it is an Integer gadget.

Example9
  Same as Example8, except that it is a Proportional gadget.



A.6  ALERTS

Example1
  This example displays an Alert message at the top of the
  display.



A.7  MENUS

Example1
  This program opens a normal window to which we connect a menu
  strip. The menu consists of four items: Plain, Bold,
  Underlined and Italic. The user can select either Plain or a
  combination of the other styles. (If the user selects Plain
  all other modes will be mutual excluded, but if the user on
  the other hand selects Bold, Underlined or Italic, only the
  Plain option will be mutual excluded.
  
  This example also shows how a program should handle the IDCMP
  flags, and how to collect several messages from one single
  menu event.

Example2
  This example is very similar to Example1, but we have this
  time put the edit styles in a subitem box which is connected
  to the one and only item box called "Style".

Example3
  This example is very similar to Example2, but the user can
  this time also access the subitems from the keyboard. For
  example, to select Bold the user only needs to press the
  right Amiga key [A] together with the "B" key.

Example4
  This program opens a normal window to which we connect a menu
  strip. The menu consists of two items: Readmode and Editmode.
  The readmode item is selected and ghosted, and when the user
  selects the editmode item, it will become disabled (ghosted)
  while the readmode item will be enabled (not ghosted). This
  means that if the program is in "readmode", the user should
  only be able to chose the "editmode", and v.v. The purpose
  with this program is to show how you can use the OnMenu and
  OffMenu functions in order to make an "user-friendly
  interface".

Example5
  Exactly as Example1 except that we have changed Intuition's
  checkmark to our own customized "arrow".

Example6
  This program opens a normal window to which we connect a menu
  strip. The menu consists of six small dices which are all
  action items. This example shows how you can use Images
  inside a menu.

Example7
  This program opens a normal window to which we connect a menu
  strip. The menu consists of one small action item with two
  images.

Example8
  Same as Example1 except that we this time will verify any
  menu operations. If the user tries to activate this program's
  menu we check if the position of the pointer is somewhere at
  the top of the window (less than 10 lines down). In that case
  the menu operation will continue as normal, otherwise we
  cancel the menu operation.

  This example shows how to handle double mouse button events.

Example5
  This example prints out the current time.



A.10  SPRITES

Example1
  This program shows how to declare and initialize some sprite
  data and a SimpleSprite structure. It also shows how to
  reserve a sprite (sprite 2), and how to move it around. The
  user moves the sprite by pressing the arrow keys.

Example2
  This program shows how to declare and initialize some sprite
  data and a SimpleSprite structure. It also shows how to
  reserve a sprite (sprite 2), and how to move it around. The
  user moves the sprite by pressing the arrow keys. In this
  example we animate the sprite (6 frames, taken from
  the arcade game Miniblast).

Example3
  This program shows how to set up a 15 coloured sprite, and
  how to move it around.



A.11  AMIGADOS

Example1
  This program collects ten integer values from the user, and
  saves them in a file ("HighScore.dat") on the RAM disk. The
  memory is then cleared, and the file cursor is moved to the
  beginning of the file. The file is then loaded into the
  memory again, and printed out.

Example2
  This example demonstrates how to create a directory called
  "MyDirectory" on the RAM disk.

Example3
  This example demonstrates how to rename files and directories.
  It will rename the file Example 1 created (called
  "HighScore.dat") to "Numbers.dat". It will also rename the
  directory Example 2 created ("MyDirectory") to "NewDirectory".

Example4
  This example demonstrates how to delete files and directories.
  It will delete the file Example 1 and directory Example 2
  created. (The file and directory are supposed to have been
  renamed by Example 3.)

Example5
  This example demonstrates how to attach a short comment to a
  file. A short file called "Letter.doc" will be created, and a
  short comment will be attached. To see the comment use the
  CLI command "List".

Example6
  This example demonstrates how to protect and unprotect files.
  The file Example 5 created ("Letter.doc") will be protected,
  and we will then try to delete it (unsuccessfully). We will
  then unprotect the file and then try to delete it
  (successfully).

Example7
  This program takes a file/directory/device name as
  parameter, and prints out some interesting information about
  it.

Example8
  This program takes a directory/device name as parameter,
  and prints out all the file/directory-names inside it. This
  example describes how to use Examine() and ExNext().



A.12  LOW LEVEL GRAPHICS ROUTINES

Example1
  This example shows how to create your own display, and fill
  it with a lot of pixels in seven different colours.

Example2
  This example shows how to create a large Raster and a smaller
  display. We fill the Raster with a lot of pixels in seven
  different colours and by altering the RxOffset and RyOffset
  values in the RasInfo structure, the Raster is scrolled in
  all directions. This method to scroll a large drawing in full
  speed is used in many games and was even used in my own
  racing game "Car".

Example3
  This example shows how to create a display that covers the
  entire display. This method is called "Overscan", and is
  primarily used in video and graphics programs, but can also
  be used in games etc to make the display more interesting.

Example4
  This example demonstrates how to open two different ViewPorts
  on the same display. The first ViewPort is in low resolution
  and use 32 colours, while the second ViewPort is in high
  resolution and only use 2 colours.

Example5
  This example demonstrates how to open a ViewPort in interlace
  mode.

Example6
  This example demonstrates how to create a ViewPort in dual
  playfield mode. Playfield 1 use four colours and is placed
  behind playfield 2 which only use two colours (transparent
  and grey). Playfield 1 is filled with a lot of dots and is
  scrolled around while playfield 2 is is not moved and is
  filled with only five grey rectangles.

Example7
  This example demonstrates how to create a ViewPort with the
  special display mode "Hold and Modify".

Example8
  This example shows how to use the functions: SetAPen(),
  SetBPen(), SetOPen(), SetDrMd(), SetDrPt(), WritePixel(),
  ReadPixel(), Move(), Draw(), Text() and finally PolyDraw().

Example9
  This example shows how to flood fill a figure, and how to
  draw filled rectangles (both solid as well as filled with
  single and multi coloured patterns).

Example10
  This example demonstrate how to use the Area Fill functions.
  [ AreaMove(), AreaDraw() and AreaEnd(). ]

Example11
  This example demonstrate how to copy rectangular memory areas
  with help of the blitter. 



A.13  VSPRITES

Example1
  This example demonstrates how to get and use a VSprite.
  The VSprite can be moved around by the user by pressing
  the arrow keys.

Example2
  This example demonstrates how to use several VSprites each
  with its own colour table.

Example3
  This program demonstrates how to animate several (!) VSprites.



A.14  HINTS AND TIPS

Example1
  This example tell you if you have an American (NTSC) or
  European (PAL) system.

Example2
  This program will print "Hello!" in the CLI window if
  started from CLI, or the text will be printed in a special
  window that is automatically opened if run from workbench.

Example3
  This program will not open any console window if run from
  workbench. The disadvantage is of course that you can not
  use any "console functions" such as printf().

Example4
  This program tells you if it was run from workbench or
  from a CLI window.
