Just a quick note about this program. You have a simple (but very
powerfull) calculator. Its all coded in C/++ for gcc/libnix, but
any amiga compiler really. It has a few warnings under gcc, but no
errors and should compile just fine.

Bugs & Stuff
------------
Yes the bad news, well me, barfly, and COP, squished most of the bugs,
to the extent that this program wont crash (i think). On most systems
infact i will go so far as to say any system.

1) The display re-drawing routines are a bit lame, they presume a
window of fixed position, now this only causes problems if you use
a very large or very small font. The code to do the calculations
properly in the source but disbled cos i had to get the program out
quick (i have an interview, and they want some code examples).

2) The maths mode select gadget does not work, and at the moment i
cant work out why not, humm. It defult to float mode and it will
overflow to expo when needed, which should be ok.


Compiling
---------
type make -f makefile and it will grind away for a minute or so and
an executable will pop out the other end. This of course presumes
that you have a full and working gnu/gcc/libnix install. If you use
another compiler (maxon/storm). just start a new project and drag
the files across, for (dice/sasc/vbcc), you will either have to
convert the makefile, see if the dmake,smake,vmake prog will deal
with gnu makefiles by changeing the compiler (and path) to dcc or
vbcc etc. The best way is probaly just to type something like

dcc Calc.clip.c Calc.gui.c Calc.main.c Calc.math.c Calc.supp.c -o
Calc -v -lm

and it should be ok.
