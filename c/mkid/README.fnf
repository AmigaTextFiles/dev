This material was submitted to me on disk by Randell Jesup.  I reorganized
it slightly (added the src and doc directories, moved the raw I/O stuff
to the source directory, added the Amiga Makefile, etc).  The binaries in
the bin directory are the ones submitted by Randall.  The ones in the source
directory are untested and were generated by my test compile.
