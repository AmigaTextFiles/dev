The following code I cooked up (pun intended) to emulate the curses functions
for putting the console into raw() or cooked() (they call it noraw()) modes.
Note that it depends on knowing how the structure FILE * stores the internal
amiga file handle. So this version will only work with the Lattice C compiler
If someone would port it to Aztec C and post it that would be appreciated. 
Anyway, it's short so I'll include it here. It's a shar file so cut off the 
message and feed it to the unix shell, or the Amiga shar program (shar -u) 
available on one of the Fish disks. Don't forget to remove the signature at 
the end of the message.
