I have elected to distribute this version in lharc format since it would not
fit in the hole I had left on this disk otherwise.  To unpack it, execute
from a CLI a command of the form:

	lharc -x -a -m cpp.lzh

For your convenience, the lharc program has been included in the :c directory
of this disk.  It will create a subdirectory called cpp and then populate it
with all the necessary files and directories.
