To Do:
~~~~~~

-For displaying memory/resource flags do a bits->name mapper
   ie Show MEMF_CHIP instead of a decimal value

-Have a flag (1 per resource type) so that when an allocation is made
   a requester appears asking if a failure should be faked.

-GUI

-Allow freeing/viewing/editing/saving of individual allocations (in GUI)

-Make amigaguide documentation

-add a 'dog tag' at end of memory allocations, and verify it's still
valid when freeing.

-make pointer_status() call which returns validity of the data:
   dhPS_NULL for a NULL pointer, DHPS_CORRUPT for corrupt data
   DHPS_OKAY for okay.

-pointer status should be defined to call an empty routine when not
DEBUGing

-directly support kprintf
