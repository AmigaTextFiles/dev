Preface
*******

   This class library defines C++ classes for MUI (See @{"MUI" Link "MUI"}.). For any
official MUI Class one C++ class exists with its own constructors and,
of course, all attributes and methods which are defined in the
corresponding class.

   Classes hierarchy derives from MUI classes hierarchy.

   There are also further classes defined here that do not exist in
MUI. These classes integrate original MUI classes.

Requirements
************

   For using this class library you have to be experienced in original
MUI programming.

   Furthermore, you must own a C++ compiler which knows about templates
and exceptions and, of course, you need MUI 3.7.

   All data models will be usable from version 1.1 of TWiMUI.

Classes
*******

   Hereunder you can find the description for each class. This chapter
articulates in four parts. First come support classes which are needed
for a comfortable programming of a class library. Then come the MUI
base classes. From none of these classes an instance can nor should be
created because the effective MUI classes derive from the latter ones.
The effective MUI classes will be then described in the third part. In
the fourth part we will present also a couple of inline functions.

   This Classlibrary uses the registered tag-base *0x06af*. So please
*DO NOT* use it in your own programs.

TWiArray
--------

     template <class T> class TWiArray
         {
         public:
             TWiArray(const ULONG);
             ~TWiArray();
             TWiArray<T> &operator= (const T &);
             T &operator[] (ULONG);
             operator APTR() const;
             ULONG size();
             ULONG length() const;
             T &addTail();
             T &insert(const ULONG);
             VOID remove(const ULONG);
             VOID remTail();
             VOID clear();
         };

Derived classes:
     none

Include file:
     classes/Datastructures/Array.h

   This class provides arrays for any kind of elements.

TWiArray(const ULONG)
     The constructor of this class initializes the array and gets
     initial number of elements it should contain. If memory allocation
     for the array fails the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception will be
     thrown. Default is 16.

operator APTR
     This method returns the array initial address.

operator=(const T &)
     This method assigns to the instance the elements of the other
     given instance. In case of an array of pointers you must be very
     careful.

operator[](ULONG)
     This method returns a reference to the single element indicated by
     the given index.

size()
     This method returns the number of allocated elements.

length()
     This method returns the number of truly available elements.

addTail()
     This method returns a reference to the element next to the last
     one. This method is used to add an element after the last
     available element. If no space is available for another element we
     will try to enlarge the array. Should this fail the *TWiMemX* (See
     @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) will be thrown. The element to add must be assigned to
     the method.

insert(ULONG)
     This method returns a reference to the element with the given
     index. All elements lying behind the given element are right
     shifted at once. This method is used to add an element inside the
     array. If no space is available for another element we will try to
     enlarge the array. Should this fail the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) will be thrown. The
     element to add must be assigned to the method.

remove(ULONG)
     This method removes the element with the given index. All elements
     lying behind are left shifted at once.

remTail()
     This method removes the last element.

clear()
     This method removes all the elements.

   *Example:*
         .
         .
         .
         TWiArray<ULONG> arr(5);
         ULONG i;
         i = 256;
         arr.addTail() = i;
         .
         .
         .

             VOID prev();
             T &item();
             BOOL isDone();
         };

Derived class:
     none

Include file:
     classes/Datastructures/Array.h

   This class provides a cursor to traverse *TWiArray* (See @{"TWiArray" Link "TWiArray"}.)
instances more comfortably.

TWiArrayCursor(TWiArrayList<T>)
     The constructor of this class initializes the cursor for the array
     for which a reference is given.

operaot! ()
     This method returns FALSE when the cursor is on a valid element
     and TRUE when the cursor is out of bounds.

first()
     This method sets the cursor to the first element.

last()
     This method sets the cursor to the last element.

next()
     This method sets the cursor to the next element.

prev()
     This method sets the cursor to the previous element.

index()
     This method returns the actual index wich represents the cursor.

item()
     This method returns a reference to the actual element, on which
     the cursor points.

isDone()
     This method returns FALSE when the cursor is on a valid element
     and TRUE when the cursor is out of bounds.

   *Example:*
         .
         .
         TWiArray<ULONG> arr(5);
         TWiArrayCursor<ULONG> arc(arr);
         ULONG i;
         for (arc.first()  ;  !arc.isDone()  ;  arc.next())
             {
             i = arc.item();
             .
             .

         };

Derived classes:
     none

Include file:
     classes/Datastructures/Buffer.h

   This class provides an easy to manage data buffer.

TWiBuffer(const ULONG)
     This constructor defines a buffer of a given size. Should this
     allocation fail, then the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception will
     be thrown. The default is 256.

TWiBuffer(const TWiBuffer &)
     This constructor takes elements from the given class and adapts a
     buffer from itself to the size of the given class and copies the
     given class buffer on its own. Should this fail to allocate memory
     then *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

operator=(const TWiBuffer &)
     This operator takes the elements from the given class and adapts a
     buffer from itself to the size of the given class and copies the
     given class buffer on its own. Should this fail to allocate memory
     then *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

operator APTR()
     This method returns the initial address of the buffer.

buffer()
     This method returns the initial address of the buffer.

size()
     This method returns the size of the buffer.

doubleBuffer(const BOOL)
     This method doubles the size of the buffer. If you specify TRUE
     (the Default) as argument the contents of the buffer is copied. If
     you specify FALSE it is not copied. Should the allocation fail the
     *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

setSize(const ULONG, const BOOL)
     This method sets the buffer size to the given value. If you
     specify TRUE (the Default) as second parameter the contents of the
     buffer is copied. If you specify FALSE it is not copied. If new
     size is smaller than the older, the buffer is cut away. Should
     allocation of new buffer fail the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.)
     exception is thrown.

setMinSize(const ULONG, const BOOL)
     This method checks if the buffer has at least the size of the first
     parameter. If it has nothing happens. If it has not a new buffer
     with the requested size is allocated. If you specify TRUE (the
     Default) as second parameter the contents of the buffer is copied.
     If you specify FALSE it is not copied. Should allocation of new
     buffer fail the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

extendBuffer(const ULONG, const BOOL)
     This method enlarges the buffer with the size of the first
     parameter. If you specify TRUE (the Default) as second parameter
     the contents of the buffer is copied. If you specify FALSE it is
     not copied. Should allocation of new buffer fail the *TWiMemX*
     (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

eraseBuffer()
     This method deletes the buffer.

   *Example:*
         .
         .
         .
         STRPTR aaa = "This is only a test";
         TWiBuffer buf(strlen(aaa)+1);
         memcpy(buf.buffer(),aaa,buf.size());
         .
         .

         };

Derived classes:
     none

Include file:
     classes/Datastructures/Format.h

   This class provides methods to comfortably call the RawDoFmt()
Amiga-Exec function.

TWiFormat(const STRPTR)
     This constructor sets the printf-style format, with which we will
     then use to format the parameters given to the format() method.
     The size of the destination buffer is set to 0.

TWiFormat(const STRPTR, const ULONG)
     This constructor sets the printf-style format, with which we will
     then to format the parameters given to the format() method. The
     size of the destination buffer is set to the value of the second
     parameter. Should the buffer allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See
     @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

TWiFormat(const ULONG)
     This constructor sets the size of the destination buffer to the
     given value. Should the buffer allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See
     @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown. The printf-style format is not set
     with this constructor and has to be then set with the Format(const
     STRPTR) method.

operator=(const TWiFormat &)
     This operator takes the format and the buffer from the given
     class, sets its own fields' size accordingly and copies in its own
     fields the elements of the given class. Should the element
     allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

Format(const STRPTR)
     This method sets the printf-style format.

Format()
     This method returns a reference to the printf-style format.

Ergebnis()
     This method returns a reference to the result of the formatting.

operator const STRPTR()
     This method returns a reference to the result of the formatting.

format(ULONG, ...)
     This method calls the Amiga-Exec RawDoFmt() function. Format
     arguments are given together as a parameter list. This method
     returns a reference of the destination buffer.

format(APTR)
     This method calls the Amiga-Exec function RawDoFmt(). Format
     arguments are given together as an array address. This method
     returns a reference of the destination buffer.

   *Example:*
         .
         .
         .
         TWiFormat form("The number %ld is formatted",50);
         cout << form.format(28) << endl;

Derived classes:
     none

Include file:
     classes/Exceptions/Exceptions.h

   This class is meant to throw exceptions after a memory allocation is
failed.

TWiMemX(const ULONG, const ULONG)
     This constructor receives as first parameter the size of the
     memory to allocate. As second parameter flags for memory
     allocation are given. This second parameter is not mandatory.
     Default is then MEMF_ANY.

size()
     This method returns the size of the allocated memory. For this, to
     return a meaningful value, you must give the value to the
     constructor.

flags()
     This method returns the flags of the allocated memory. For this,
     to return a meaningful value, you must give the value to the
     constructor.

   *Example:*
         .
         .
         VOID Class::Method()
             {
             .

Include file:
     classes/Exec/Share.h This class is used for a more simple managing
of dynamic objects. When a dynamic object appears in a class (e.g. an
element allocated by "new") it must be correctly destroyed in the
destructor. But if the dynamic object has been given to another class
by the copy constructor or by the operator= pointer, the destruction
must take place in the last instance destructor. This can made safe by
using this class as base class and testing the only() method in the
destructor.

TWiShare()
     This constructor initializes this class. Should initialization
     fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) is thrown.

TWiShare(const TWiShare &)
     This constructor has to take care that a copy of this instance is
     made.

only()
     This method returns TRUE when this instance is the last one using
     this object. Otherwise, FALSE.

   *Example:*
         .
         .
         class Class : protected TWiShare

Include file:
     classes/Exec/Share.h This class is similiar to the class
*TWiShare* (See @{"TWiShare" Link "TWiShare"}.) with the difference that referencing and
dereferencing has to be done manual. This may be usefull if the managed
ressource does not belong directly to the class.

TWiShareManual()
     This constructor initializes this class. Should initialization
     fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) is thrown.

TWiShareManual(const TWiShareManual &)
     This constructor has to take care that a copy of this instance is
     made.

reference()
     This method increases the counter how often this ressource is used.

dereference()
     This method decreases the counter how often this ressource is used.

only()
     This method returns TRUE when this instance is the last one using
     this object. Otherwise, FALSE.

   *Example:* See @{"TWiShare" Link "TWiShare"}.

   This class provides a comfortable string handling.

TWiStr(const STRPTR)
     This constructor allocates a memory area of the length of the
     specified string and copies the given string onto it. Should the
     memoty allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is
     thrown. Default is an empty string with a length of 64 bytes.

TWiStr(const STRPTR, const ULONG)
     This constructor allocates a memory area of the length specified
     as second parameter and copies onto it the content of the first
     parameter. The last Byte of the buffer is filled with a Null-Byte
     to ensure a valid string. Should the memory allocation fail, the
     *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

TWiStr(const UBYTE)
     This constructor makes a 2 byte long null-terminated string from
     the given Character. Should the memoru allocation fail, the
     *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

TWiStr(const TWiStr &)
     This constructor makes a copy of the given instance. Should the
     memory allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is
     thrown.

operator STRPTR()
     This operator returns the initial address of the string.

operator=(const TWiStr &)
     This operator takes the string in the given class, creates its own
     fields accordingly, and copies onto it the string in the given
     class. Should the allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.)
     exception is thrown.

operator=(const STRPTR)
     This operator takes the given string, creates its own fields
     accordingly and copies onto it the given string. Should the
     allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

operator=(const UBYTE)
     This operator takes the given character, creates its own fields
     accordingly and copies onto it the given character and the
     null-byte. Should the allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See
     @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

operator=(const ULONG)
     This operator takes the given number, converts it into the
     corresponding string, creates its own fields accordingly and
     copies onto it the given character and the null-byte. Should the
     allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

operator=(const LONG)
     This operator takes the given number, converts it into the
     corresponding string, creates its own fields accordingly and
     copies onto it the given character and the null-byte. Should the
     allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

operator[](ULONG)
     This operator returns a reference of the indexed character. If the
     Index is to high the buffer is doubled. Should the allocation
     fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

operator+=(const TWiStr &)
     This operator takes the string from the given class and
     concatenates it to its own string. In the case its field is too
     small, it will be enlarged. Should enlargement fail the *TWiMemX*
     (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

operator+=(const STRPTR)
     This operator takes the given string and concatenates it to its
     own. In the case its field is too small, it will be enlarged.
     Should enlargement fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is
     thrown.

operator+=(const UBYTE)
     This operator takes the given byte and concatenates it to its own
     string. In the case its field is too small, it will be enlarged.

size()
     This method returns the size of the buffer.

length()
     This method returns the length of the string.

left(ULONG)
     This method returns an instance of TWiStr class which will contain
     the leftmost part of the string. The number of characters to
     return is given as the only parameter. Should the buffer
     allocation fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

mid(ULONG, ULONG)
     This method returns an instance of TWiStr class which will contain
     the central part of the string. The first parameter specifies the
     start position of the string to return and the second one
     specifies the length. Should the buffer allocation fail, the
     *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

right(ULONG)
     This method returns an instance of TWiStr class which will contain

     parameter. If it is not found -1 is returned. The search starts at
     the position wich is defined as second parameter. 0 is the default.

cut(const ULONG)
     This method cuts the string at the given position. The size of the
     buffer is not altered. If the parameter is higher than the
     string-length nothing is happen.

shrinkBuffer()
     This method sets the buffer size according to the string plus the
     null byte. Should this fail, the *TWiMemX* (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.)
     exception is thrown.

doubleBuffer()
     This method doubles the buffer. Should this fail, the *TWiMemX*
     (See @{"TWiMemX" Link "TWiMemX"}.) exception is thrown.

   *Example:*
         .
         .

   This class does not have any official constructor, as no instances
should be created from it. It is used to define a BrokerHook in an
Application. For this the tag *MUIA_Application_BrokerHook* should be
set to the *broker()* method return value and the *BrokerHookFunc()*
method is invoked too.

Popstring. For this the tag *MUIA_Popstring_OpenHook* should be set to
the *open()* method return value and the *OpenHookFunc()* method is
invoked too.

   *Example:*
     class Pop : public MUIPopstring
         {
         private:
             virtual BOOL OpenHookFunc(struct Hook *,
                                       Object *,
                                       Object **);

   This class does not have any official constructor. It is used to
identify an object with a label and, at the same time, to define a
control character for use with keyboard. For this you must assign to
the derived class a string for the label in which you must precede the
control character with an underscore ("_"). This underscore will be
stripped from the string and the control character will be underlined.

   *Example:*
     VOID main()
         {
         MUILabString Str("_String:","Contents",32);
         .
         .

   Here we describe the C++ classes that come from single MUI classes.
Furthermore we also describe further classes that are derived from
these and that offer more support to the programmer.

   For any MUI-Attribute, which can be set or get, a corresponding
method with the same name exists to set and get the attribute. Methods
with parameters are used to set attributes and methods with return
values to get them.

   Also for MUI methods corresponding methods with the same name exist.

   Should methods or attributes with standard parameters exist like,
for example, *MUIV_Application Load_ENV*, or also *...ENVARC*,
possibilities in *MUIM_Application_Load*, then you can find for those
ready-to-use methods for which you don't have to give any parameters.
(In these cases you don't need to use neither *LoadENV* nor
*LoadENVARC*.)

UserDispatch
------------

   Because this classes library is based on MUI custom classes, it is
necessary to use own dispatchers for MUI classes. For each class,
therefore, a virtual function * ULONG UserDispatch(struct IClass *,
Object *, Msg)* exists that can be used. In the scope of this function
you can then define your own methods. This must not be forgotten, of
course, because all unknown methods are passed to the superclass with
DoSuperMethod().

   This is the C++ class for the MUI Aboutmui class. Tags are given to
the constructors that are needed to create an Aboutmui window. In this,
tags can be given as variable parameters or as pointers in a list.

   Alternatively the constructor can also be used without parameters.
In this case the *Create()* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) method must be used to
create the MUI About window. To this method you can give variable tag
lists or pointers to a tag list.

   *Example:*

tags can be given as variable parameters or as pointers in a list.

   Alternatively the constructor can also be used without parameters.

     This method is used to send MUI in the Wait()-loop and get single
     signals and process them. Because this class library is based on
     the custom classes, single methods can be easily implemented with
     own dispatchers (See @{"UserDispatch" Link "UserDispatch"}.), and using
     MUIA-Application_ReturnID is not needed, excepted
     MUI_Application_Return_ID_Quit, with which the Loop() method is
     broken.

Add
     This method is used to dynamically add a Window to an Application.

Rem
     This method is used to remove again a Window from an Application.

   *Example:*
     VOID main()
         {
         MUIApplication App(
             MUIA_Application_Title, "???",
             MUIA_Application_Version, "$VER: ????",
             TAG_DONE);
         .
         .
         .
         };

Include file:
     classes/TWiMUI/Area.h

   This is the C++ class for the MUI Area class. Tags are given to the
constructors that are needed to create an Area. In this, tags can be
given as variable parameters or as pointers in a list.

   Alternatively the constructor can also be used without parameters.
In this case the *Create()* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) method must be used to
create the MUI Area. To this method you can give variable tag lists or
pointers to a tag list.

   In normal cases no instances are created from this class, as this is
a superclass for almost all MUI objects.

   For this class one more method exists:
WinClass
     This method returns a pointer to an instance of the MUIWindow
     class, to which this object is linked.

   *Example:*
     VOID main()
         {
         MUIArea Area(
             MUIA_ObjectID, 1,
                .
                .
                .

be given as variable parameters or as pointers in a list.

   Alternatively the constructor can also be used without parameters.
In this case the *Create()* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) method must be used to
create the MUI Menu object. To this method you can give variable tag
lists or pointers to a tag list.

   For this class two more constructors are implemented. To both of
them a pointer to a string as first parameter is given. This string
becomes the title of the menu. After this, either a list of Menuitem
object pointers or a list of pointers to MUIMenuitem class instances
can be given. Both lists must be null-terminated.

   *Example:*
     VOID main()
         {
         MUIMenu men(
             MUIA_Menu_Title, "Title",
                .

Include file:
     classes/TWiMUI/Notify.h

   This is the C++ class for the MUI Notify class. From this class no
instances should be created as this class acts as a super class for all
other MUI classes.

   Generally the *Create()* method is available. This method is used to
consequently create a MUI object, when the corresponding constructor
has been invoked without parameters. To this method tags that are
needed to create the corresponding MUI object are given. With this,
tags can be given as variable parameters or also as a list of pointers.

   For this class one more method exists:
AppClass
     This method returns a pointer to the MUIApplication instance to
     which this object is linked.

OwnMethod
     This method enables you to call an selfdefined method in an
     selfdefined class in a C++-syntax. The first parameter is the
     Method-Id of the wanted method. The second parameter is the number
     of the following parameters. After this number follows the
     parameter wich are passed to your method. The number can be 0.
     This can be useful if you obtain a pointer to a window of
     MUIWindow-Class with *WinClass()* (See @{"MUIArea" Link "MUIArea"}.) but this is only
     the base of your own window. Than you can call your own method in
     the following way:
              WinClass()->OwnMethod(id,2,parm1,parm2);

   There are two more constructors that make building of Numericbutton
object easy. To both a string pointer is first given. This string will
define the prtintf-style format to which the object content should be
formatted for displaying. Second and third parameters define minimum

an UBYTE also, which will become the control character.

   This class provides further support for creating a Numericbutton
object. A string pointer is given to the constructor as the first
parameter. This string will precede the object as its label.
Furthermore, this string is parsed for an underscore ("_") and the
following character will be underlined in the label. Furthermore this
character becomes the control character. The second parameter is again
a string pointer. This string will define the printf-style format to
which the object content should be formatted for displaying. Third and
fourth parameters define minimum and maximum values for this object.

   *Example:*
     VOID main()

In this case the *Create()* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) method must be used to

   There are two more constructors that make building of Numericbutton
object easy. To both a pointer to an array of string pointers is given.
These strings define either the number of radio buttons and also their
names. The array must be null-terminated. If desired, than, you can
provide an UBYTE also, which will become the control character.

   This class provides further support for creation of a Radio object.
A string pointer is given to the constructor as the first parameter.
This string will precede the object as its label. Furthermore, this
string is parsed for an underscore ("_") and the following character
will be underlined in the label. Furthermore, this character becomes
the control character. The second parameter is again a pointer to an
array of string pointers. These strings define either the number of
radio buttons and also their names. The array must be null-terminated.

In this case the *Create()* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) method must be used to
create the MUI Semaphore object. To this method you can give variable
tag lists or pointers to a tag list.

   *Example:*
     VOID main()
         {
         MUISemaphore se(TAG_DONE);
         .
         .
         .

   This is the C++ class for the MUI Slider class. Tags are given to the
constructors that are needed to create a Slider object. In this, tags

   There are two more constructors that make creation of Slider object
easy. First and second parameters define minimum and maximum for the
object. If desired, than, you can provide an UBYTE also, which will
become the control character.

A string pointer is given to the constructor as the first parameter.
This string will precede the object as its label. Furthermore, this
string is parsed for an underscore ("_") and the following character
will be underlined in the label. Furthermore, this character becomes
the control character. The second and third parameters define the
minimum and maximum values for this object.

Derived classes:

Include file:
     classes/TWiMUI/String.h

   This is the C++ class for the MUI String class. Tags are given to the
constructors that are needed to create a String object. In this, tags
can be given as variable parameters or as pointers in a list.

   Alternatively the constructor can also be used without parameters.
In this case the *Create()* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) method must be used to
create the MUI String object. To this method you can give variable tag
lists or pointers to a tag list.

   Furthermore, there are six more constructors implemented that make
creation of String or Integer objects easy.

   The first two constructors are added here to create simple String
objects. To both a string pointer is given as first parameter, that
will become the object's initial content. The second parameter
establishes the object's maximum length. If desired you can also pass
an UBYTE. This character will become the control character.

   The other constructors are meant for creating Integer objects. If
the first two parameters are both ULONG values, then the first one
defines the content of the object and is turned into a string, so that
the content can be shown. The second parameter defines, then, the
object's maximum length. Anyway, if only one ULONG parameter is given
there is no initial content of the object and the given parameter
defines the maximum object's length. To all these objects an UBYTE
parameter can be given also. This character, then, becomes the control
character.

   *Example:*
     VOID main()
         {
         MUIString str1("Content 1",20);
         MUIString str2("Content 2",20,'a');

object. Third parameter is an ULONG value, which gives the object's
maximum length.

Inline functions
================

   Here we show some inline-defined functions. They are some calls to
the MUI_MakeObject() function. These calls have been newly defined here
to have a strong type checking. You must be very careful as objects
created by this functions are not automatically destroyed as they have
not any destructor. They should be used, then, in a parameter list
during creation of other objects. These functions are then defined also
for objects which normally don't need any method or don't have any
further attribute only.

   For the exact meaning of these objects please refer to the MUI
documentation.

     inline Object *MakeLabel(const STRPTR lab)
     inline Object *MakeLabel1(const STRPTR lab)
     inline Object *MakeLabel2(const STRPTR lab)

Interface
*********

   Here I try to explain how you can write own classes for *public
custom classes*. I'll do it using the class *Busy.mcc* as an example.

   Therefore here first comes the header-file:
     class MUIBusy : public MUIArea
         {
         protected:
             virtual const ULONG ClassNum() const;
         public:
             MUIBusy(const struct TagItem *t) : MUIArea(MUIC_Busy) { init(t); };
             MUIBusy(const Tag t, ...);
             MUIBusy() : MUIArea(MUIC_Busy) { };
             MUIBusy(const MUIBusy &);
             virtual ~MUIBusy();
             MUIBusy &operator= (const MUIBusy &);
             VOID Speed(const LONG p) { set(MUIA_Busy_Speed,(ULONG)p); };
             VOID SpeedOff() { set(MUIA_Busy_Speed,MUIV_Busy_Speed_Off); };
             VOID SpeedUser() { set(MUIA_Busy_Speed,MUIV_Busy_Speed_User); };
             LONG Speed() const { return((LONG)get(MUIA_Busy_Speed,0L)); };
             VOID Move() { dom(MUIM_Busy_Move); };
         };

   Now we are going to explain the base-class and the methods (if there
are more questions please have a look in the source or contact me (See
@{"Author" Link "Author"}.).

MUIArea
     This is the base-class for *MUIBusy*. because Area.mcc is the
     base-class of Busy.mcc.

ClassNum()
     This method is defined that throwing the exception *MUIErrorX* the
     correct constant *MUIV_TWiMUI_MUIErrorX_xxxx*. *xxxx* means the
     class wich caused the exception. I suggest the using of numbers
     from 1025 up for selfdefined classes. This should be enough to
     leave a reasonable amount of numbers for MUI-standard-classes.

MUIBusy(const struct TagItem *t) : MUIArea(MUIC_Busy) { init(t); };
     This constructor first initialises the class MUIArea and passes
     its name so that the subclass is created of Busy.mcc. After that
     the method *init()* is called with the pointer of the
     TagItem-structure as parameter to create the object. If creation
     of the class or of the object fails the exception *MUIErrorX* (See
     @{"MUIErrorX" Link "MUIErrorX"}.) is thrown.

MUIBusy(const Tag t, ...);
     This constructor first initialises the class MUIArea and passes
     its name so that the subclass is created of Busy.mcc. After that
     the parameters are collected with the standard-macros and an
     instance of *TWiTag* (See @{"TWiTag" Link "TWiTag"}.) is defined. The address of the
     TagItem-structure of his instance of TWiTag is passed to the method
     *init()* as parameter to create the object. If creation of the
     class or of the object fails the exception *MUIErrorX* (See
     @{"MUIErrorX" Link "MUIErrorX"}.) is thrown.

MUIBusy() : MUIArea(MUIC_Busy) { };
     This constructor first initialises the class MUIArea and passes
     its name so that the subclass is created of Busy.mcc. If creation
     of the class or of the object fails the exception *MUIErrorX* (See
     @{"MUIErrorX" Link "MUIErrorX"}.) is thrown. An object of this clss is not build in this
     constructor. This has to be done with the method *Create()* of
     *MUINotify* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.).

MUIBusy(const MUIBusy &);
     This copy-constructor first initialises the class MUIArea and
     passes its name so that the subclass is created of Busy.mcc. After
     that the TWiTag-instance of the parameter-class is copied and the
     pointer to the TagItem-structure if this instance is passed to the
     method init() to create an object. If creation of the class or of
     the object fails the exception *MUIErrorX* (See @{"MUIErrorX" Link "MUIErrorX"}.) is
     thrown.

~MUIBusy();
     This destructor has no special function.

MUIBusy &operator= (const MUIBusy &);
     This operator first tests if this assignement is to itself. If
     this is true nothing happens. If not the assignement-operator of
     MUIArea is called. After that the TWiTag-instance of the
     parameter-class is copied and the pointer to the TagItem-structure
     if this instance is passed to the method init() to create an
     object.

VOID Speed(const LONG p) { set(MUIA_Busy_Speed,(ULONG)p); };
     This method sets the Attribut MUIA_Busy_Speed with the passed
     parameter. Therefor this the method *set()* of *MUINotify* (See
     @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) is used. This method calls the Intuition-function
     SetAttrs with the object-pointer of this class, MUIA_Busy_Speed as
     attribute and the passed parameter as value. If the object-pointer
     is NULL nothing happens.

VOID SpeedOff() { set(MUIA_Busy_Speed,MUIV_Busy_Speed_Off); };
     This method is nearly the same as *Speed* with the difference that
     the parameter of the method *set* is the predefined value
     MUIV_Busy_Speed_Off.

VOID SpeedUser() { set(MUIA_Busy_Speed,MUIV_Busy_Speed_User); };
     This method is nearly the same as *Speed* with the difference that
     the parameter of the method *set* is the predefined value
     MUIV_Busy_Speed_User.

LONG Speed() { return((LONG)get(MUIA_Busy_Speed,0L); };
     This method reads the Attribut MUIA_Busy_Speed. Therefor the
     method *get()* of *MUINotify* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) is used. This
     method calls the Intuition-function GetAttr with the object-pointer
     of this class and MUIA_Busy_Speed as attribute. The value of
     GetAttr() is returned. If the object-pointer is NULL the second
     parameter is returned.

VOID Move() { dom(MUIM_Busy_Move); };
     This method executes the method MUIM_Busy_Move. Therefor the
     method *dom()* of *MUINotify* (See @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) is called. This
     method calls the Intuition-function DoMethodA() with the
     object-pointer and MUIM_Busy_Move as methodid. The value of
     DoMethodA() is returned. The method *dom()* in *MUINotify* (See
     @{"MUINotify" Link "MUINotify"}.) is defined with 0 to 7 parameters. For example the
     method *Exchange* of *MUIList* (See @{"MUIList" Link "MUIList"}.) needs 2 parameter.
     So it is defined in the following manner:
          VOID Exchange(LONG p1, LONG p2) { dom(MUIM_List_Exchange,p1,p2); };

Acknowledgements
****************

   First of all I have to thank my wife, whom it was almost impossible
to see me around.

   Secondly I have to thank StormC/C++ developers who made possible
using a full-featured C++ language on the AMIGA.

   And of course all those who contributed with their comments and
incitements in building the library.

Limitations
***********

   You can find a limitation in the unregistered version compared to
the full version, i.e. it is possible to create a maximum of 40 objects
in a program. If you try to create more objects the MUIErroX exception
will be thrown with error 999.

   Otherwise there are no other limitations.
