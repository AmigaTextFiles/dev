   Usage: n2w [OPTIONS] num [num ...]

   OPTIONS:
    -$, --dollars	       display as dollars and cents
    -U units, --units=units    print "units" after number

       By default, n2w gives the number by itself, e.g.:
	    n2w 21 => twenty-one

       and fractions are printed as:
	    n2w 4.56 => four point five six

       With the -$ or --dollars option, these would appear as:
	    n2w -$ 21	  => twenty-one dollars only
	    n2w -$ 4.56   => four dollars and 56 cents

       By selecting another unit, e.g. degrees, these would become:
	    n2w -U degrees 21	  => twenty-one degrees
	    n2w -U degrees 4.56   => four point five six degrees


    -u,  --nand, --US	do not use "and" after "hundred"
       In the USA, unlike other English-speaking countries, the "and" is
       ommitted after the word hundred, e.g.:
	    n2w 234	    => two hundred thirty-four
       instead of:
	    n2w 234	    => two hundred and thirty-four


    -&,  --ampersand	use "&" instead of "and" after "hundred", etc.

	 --help 	display this help and exit

    -v,  --verbose	set verbose mode on
    -Vn, --verbose=n	set level of verbosity
	Verbose mode does nothing at the moment; I include it in all my
	programs  for help in debugging. Is there a possible use for it in
	n2w?

	 --version	output version information and exit

  Options may be placed anywhere on the command line EXCEPT that a negative
  number must be preceded by "--" (to indicate end of dashed options).

  BUGS: No warning is given if number supplied exceeds the limit

  HISTORY:

      I originally wrote n2w in 1987 in ARexx, then converted it to C, in
      order to print cheques. As I am planning to move most of my work from
      the Amiga to a Linux box, I have been converting all my programs to a
      more-or-less standard C. I could not find the C source to n2w, so I
      rewrote it yesterday, adding a number of features.

      It could do with some cleaning up, and there are probably obvious
      things I have forgotten to include, but it does the job I originally
      intended: converting relatively small amounts for printing cheques.

      Please let me know if you find any bugs, or have any suggestions for
      improvement.
