IMPORTANT: Please touch all #?.c before proceeding.
Then edit the opening lines of smakefile so that it has the proper
directory information for your local system.

To make mctangle and mcweave say `make all'; this should produce roughly
the following actions (possibly with harmless warning messages from sc):

sc code=far data=far nominc mctangle.c
sc code=far data=far nominc def CWEBINPUTS=TeX:inputs/cweb mcommon.c
slink lib LIB:scnb.lib LIB:amiga.lib from LIB:c.o mctangle.o mcommon.o to mctangle
mctangle mcweave
sc code=far data=far nominc mcweave.c
slink lib LIB:scnb.lib LIB:amiga.lib from LIB:c.o mcweave.o mcommon.o to mcweave

To get some reassurance that things are OK, you can say `make cautiously',
which ensures that mCTANGLE will reproduce itself. (Otherwise the source
files mcommon.w and mctangle.w won't actually have been used.)

To install mcweave and mctangle say `make install'.

To make the usermanual, say 'make usermanual'. The user manual is written
in LaTeX. The mcweb distribution contains some style files, that are used
by the manual.
Usually, you should already have those files. If you are missing some of
them, they should be copied to the LaTeX style file directory before
making the manual.
