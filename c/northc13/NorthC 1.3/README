NorthC Version 1.3  December 1990 (c) 1990 S.Hawtin.


		NorthC by Steve Hawtin and others


  Welcome to NorthC Version 1.3, this is the latest version of NorthC, 
a complete environment for developing 'C' programs.  This directory contains 
all you need to compile and link 'C' programs.  This version of NorthC has 
many bug fixes, more documentation, lots more example code and some 
improvements.  Details are all given in the "CHANGES" file on the "NorthC:" 
disk.

  This distribution of "NorthC" has been compressed, to make it easier to 
copy.  You will have to uncompress the NorthC disks before you can start.  To 
uncompress the disk you should

  1)  Create two empty blank floppies called "NorthC" and "NorthC Examples", 
      you can do this with the CLI commands

    format drive df0: name "NorthC" NOICONS
    format drive df0: name "NorthC Examples" NOICONS

  2)  Write protect your workbench disk and the disk this file is on.
  3)  Close all the windows you do not need and run the "unpack" program.


  The "Unpack" program should work on anything from a vanilla Amiga 500 
upwards, however I have not tested it on OS versions before 1.3, or on 
other Amigas.  If you have problems then the file "unpack.script" contains 
the CLI instructions to unpack the release.

  It is my understanding that all the data and programs on this disk can be 
freely copied, provided the restrictions noted in the various documentation 
files are observed.  You use the information and programs on this disk at 
your own risk, neither myself or any other member of Alcibiades Cabal can 
accept any resposiblity for any damage caused as a result of using this disk.

  The NorthC disk is a combination of programs from various sources, the 
most complete list of contributors is on the "NorthC:" disk.
