this is a source-dump of my QuakeTools project. it is an entry to a
greater project of documenting quakes ans quakeIIs file-internals and
a library to create and modify and show all of their files.

take a look in the doc-dir.

NOTE: nearly 90% of the code is strict ANSI-C, the rest of 10%
      are 3 nested functions.

people who wants to give their pennies to this project are welcome.

 current features in short:

        read/writes picture formats:
        
         ppm/pgm/png/jpg
        
        read/writes 3d formats:
        
         tddd/3DS
         
        read/writes quake formats:
        
         wad/(bsp/vis/lit/prt/h?/map)/pak/(qc/dat)/mip/lmp
         
        read only quake formats:
        
         bsps of quakeII
        
        others:
        
         can compress wads
         can do fs-dithering
         can do smoothing
         uses high quality mipmap-scaling
         build in script-system with recursion-capabilities
         can load pictures directly into bsps
         uses less memory
         error robust
         can parse entire directories and perform the default actions to every file
          and subdirectory
         can extract bsp/pak recursively

	display:
	
	 animateables lights
	 possiblity to visualise the process of qbsp and light
	 transparent water
	 splitted in system-independend and system-dependend parts
	 rudimenal game-capabilities
	 wire/flat/8bit/16bit/24bit/32bit graphics-driver
	 multiple displays

	executables:
	
	 qbsp
	 light
	 rad
	 vis
	 qview
	 ppmdiff
	 qcc
	 qtools

NOTE: some of these features exists only rudimental and are not really
      functional
