	Version 0.0:

	 most of the code works, means:
	  graphic-conversions (Load/SaveImage)
	  bsp-building (qbsp)
	  vis-calculation (vis)
	  map-conversion (Load/SaveMAPFile/LoadBSPFile)
	  wads (Add/ExtractWAD2)
	  paks (Add/ExtractPAK)
	  mipmaps
	  quakec (qcc/unqcc)
	 problems exists with:
	  light-calculation (untested, maybe it works)
	  tddd-save (Imagine can't load it, but every other program I have)
	  tddd-load (last version was okay, new version untested)
	 exists only in scrabboard
	  rad (radiosity from quakeII converted to quakeI)
	  transparency (generation of transparency-tables, for what ever ...)

	 ?quest: test the less used commands of qbsp (eg.
	         hullnum ...)
	 ?quest: uhh, f*ck, there are MANY Big*-functions
	         missed in TDDD.c

	 	 eg. a chasecam and the player-view in two
	 	 displays at the same time			libqdisplay/*, libqsys/generic.c

	 	  alpha-dec-osf4.0
	 	  m68k-unknown-amigaos

		 maybe this means it run on EVERY *ix-platform
	 ...	 too much in the meanwhile i remember
