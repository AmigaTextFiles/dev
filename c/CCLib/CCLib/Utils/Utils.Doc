---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I) CCLIB.LIBRARY

   All of these utilities use CClib.library which you need to put in your
   LIBS: directory. The reason the programs are so small is that the
   overhead for the C library is all in one place.
   I don't know about you but I need every last bit of disk space on
   my system. The Amiga community should DEMAND that C programmers use this
   library for all their programs, this will eventually save you from
   having to upgrade your system because you are out disk space or RAM.
   You certainly don't need multiple copies of the Aztec and Lattice C
   libraries imbedded in your programs.

   The binary version of CClib.library is available in the form of
   USRCCLIB.lzh found on many BBS's including Compuserve and Codename:
   Lorraine BBS (805-648-7833). If you wish to write PD C programs that
   use CClib.library look for the full version of CClib.library in the
   form of CCLIB.lzh which contains everything you need to write programs
   for CClib.library. If you are a commercial software developer you will
   need pay the one license fee of $50 to distribute CClib.library with
   your software, however I urge you to get the non-commercial version
   and evaluate it first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
II) BITES

	   Documentation For 'Bites' Version 1.3
		 It's smaller, and better.

		     Introduction

   Bites is a program written at the request of "MIKE VDS"
   by Robert W. Albrecht. It is designed to display disk space
   available on all mounted volumes.


		     How to use Bites...

   Run the program by double clicking on it's icon or typing:
   'RUN Bites' from the CLI prompt.

   Bites needs at least a 2500 byte stack.

   A small window will appear in the title bar with the Bites icon at the
   left. When you click on the Bites icon the program terminates. The
   window can be dragged around like any other intuition window. The
   standard 'to back' and 'to front' system gadgets appear at the right of
   the window. There are two other gadgets to the left of the system
   gadgets that control the behaviour of Bites.

   When Bites first comes up it will cycle through all of the mounted
   volumes and display the number of bytes available on each volume every
   three seconds. To stop cycling through the volumes click on the 'up and
   down arrow' gadget. The next time you click on the 'up and down arrow'
   gadget the next volume in the list will be displayed. To return to
   cycling mode click on the 'circle arrow' gadget.

   The Bites window can be 'iconified' by clicking the right mouse button
   while it's window is active. The window will reduce to a 24x10 Bites
   icon that takes a minimum amount of screen space. To 'un-iconify' the
   Bites window just activate the window by clicking on the icon with the
   left mouse button, then click the right mouse button.

   Bites can also be terminated by use of the Amiga DOS Break command.
   First type 'Status' at the CLI and get the Process ID of Bites then type
   'Break <Process ID>'.


		  Enhancements Made for Version 1.1

   You can now control the position and size of the Bites window through
   command line switches or icon 'Tool Types'. You may also display free
   'blocks' instead of free bytes.

   CLI command line switches:

   -l<Left Edge>	Left edge of Bites window in pixels

   -t<Top Edge> 	Top Edge of Bites window in pixels

   -w<Width>		Width of Bites window in pixels

   -b			Displays 'blocks' instead of bytes

	 EXAMPLE: RUN BITES -l0 -t20 -w640 -b

   Icon Tool Types:

   LEFTEDGE=<Left Edge>  Left Edge of Bites window in pixels

   TOPEDGE=<Top Edge>	 Top Edge of Bites window in pixels

   WIDTH=<Width>	 Width of Bites window in pixels

   SHOWBLOCKS=ON	 Displays 'blocks' instead of bytes

	 EXAMPLE:

	 LEFTEDGE=0
	 TOPEDGE=20
	 WIDTH=640
	 SHOWBLOCKS=ON


	       Bug Fixes Made for Version 1.1

   There was a bug where if you had an 'ASSIGN' to a disk that was no
   longer in the drive a system requester would come up and not go away.
   This has been fixed. Now when this situation exists the volume name will
   be given and instead of bytes free or blocks free the message 'Not
   Installed' will be displayed. This way you will be clued into assigns
   that are just flopping around.

	       Bug Fixes made for version 1.2

   The command line arguments for width and left-edge and top-edge are now
   checked for correctness. The width has to be greater than 24, and the
   left-edge and top-edge have to be greater than zero.

	       Enhancements for version 1.3

   Bites now uses CClib.library which is a shareable C library. This has
   reduced the size of the executable to 5288 from 6420 bytes. For bites
   version 1.3 to work you MUST have CClib.library installed in your LIBS:
   directory. You can find the binary only version of CClib.library under
   the name USRCCLIB.lzh on many BSS's.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
III) EXEC

   SYNTAX: Exec

   Exec displays a list of the data structures used by the Amiga OS. This
   includes a list of; memory, resources, devices, interrupt handlers,
   libraries, message ports, and tasks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IV) IFFCheck

   SYNTAX: IFFCheck <iff file name>

   IFFCheck checks the integrity of any IFF file.

   A typical listing looks like this:

--- Checking file "pic:life/pumpkin"---
 FORM 6194 ILBM
. BMHD 20
. CMAP 96
. CRNG 8
. CRNG 8
. CRNG 8
. CRNG 8
. BODY 5985
--- (IFF_OKAY) A good IFF file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
V) LOC

   SYNTAX: LOC [-Q] <files1> <files2> ...

   The -Q switch turns off the file-by-file listing of files and only
   prints the totals.

   The file name arguments can contain the '*' and '?' wild card characters.

   Loc counts lines of C code and gives other statistics.
   Here is an example of it's output:

   Lines Of C (LOC) by Robert W. Albrecht


   The file loc.c contains...
   157 lines of code, 20 blank lines, 2387 bytes of code,
   1032 bytes of whitespace, and 479 bytes of comments.
   The average code line has 15 bytes.
   The code content is 61%, 69% without comments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VI) NOIBM

   SYNTAX: NoIBM [>outfile] infile

   Noibm will strip the carriage returns from a file. Typically text files
   from an IBM PC will have <CR><LF> at the end of each line, where on Amiga
   DOS and UNIX lines are terminated only with <LF>. By default output
   is directed to the console, but you can redirect it to a file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VII) NOW

   SYNTAX: now

   Now will display the date in a more American fasion. Here is some
   example output:

   Saturday October, 07 1989 02:24 AM

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
VIII) NUKELIB

   SYNTAX: NukeLib <lib1.library> <lib2.library> ...

   NukeLib removes un-needed libraries from memory. For example:

   NukeLib CClib.library

   removes CClib.library if no programs are using it. This is really
   not necessacary because Amiga OS will attempt to remove libraries
   when it needs the memory. To find out the names of the libraries in
   memory use the exec program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IX) SETPRI

   SYNTAX: SetPri

   SetPri will allow you set the priority of any task in the system, even
   while it is running. This is very useful for controlling your multi-
   tasking computer. After you type SetPri you will be shown a list of the
   currently running tasks in the system and be asked for the number
   of the task to change the priority of. You can then enter the
   priority of the task.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

X) XWAIT

SYNTAX:

   XWAIT HH:MM[:SS] [[MM-DD-YY] TOMORROW,SUN,MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI,SAT]

 Waits until a specified time, or a key is pressed. If ^C is pressed a code
 of 20 is returned, if ^D ^E or ^F is pressed a code of 10 is returned, if
 the time arrives to stop waiting then a 0 is returned. If an error occurs
 30 is returned.

 The command line arguments are given as a time and a date. XWAIT will stop
 waiting when the time is greater than or equal to that given.
