Introduction
************

IMPORTANT: If you didn't do so, you should get the user archive  of  MBE
  called  'MBE_xx' (where  xx is the version). You should install it and
  read  the  doumenatation.  You  should   have   read   the   developer
  documentation of MUI, too.

MBE is a nice thing. But it's also a kind of a hack! So you  should  use
MBE  only  if  you really need it. If you simply want to display a logo,
you shouldn't use MBE but load an ILBM brush with Bodychunk class.

The developer version of MBE is Giftware. That  means  that  you  should
send  me  a  gift  if  you  use MBE in your application. I prefer money,
CDs/LPs/MCs with (Hard-)Rock, Blues or Jazz music or FD  software  about
MUI,  MagicWB,  C  programming and MIDI :) You should send at least your
program that uses MBE on disk(s). My address is:

                            Johannes Beigel
                            Fliederstr. 43a
                              65396 Walluf
                                GERMANY

I'm sorry, but I don't have a modem.

NOTE: A nice gift would be translations the C  include  file  into  some
other  programming  languages.  I only "speak" C (and a little bit C++),
but it would be nice to have Oberon, M2, Assembler... includes  in  this
archive.


Requirements:
*************

You must own MBE ==> You must own at least MUI 2.1 ==> You must  own  at
least OS 2.04.

You have to be a registered user of MUI.


Principle
*********

This is the way MBE works:

- You create an MBE-image with the developer prefs editor of  MBE.  Then
you save (or 'use') the settings.

- You create an object of MBE class in your application, where you  pass
the  ID  of your MBE-image. Since MBE class is a subclass of Image class
(and Area class) you can create a button gadget or something  else  with
your MBE-image.

- MBE class loads the settings file at object-creation-time and searches
for  the  given  ID.  If it finds an MBE-image with the ID, it loads the
imagery and displays it.

I think the principle is very simple and easy to understand. But the big
advantage for the user is the ability to configure the MBE-images.


The Developer Prefs-Editor
**************************

The developer prefs editor is almost the same program as the user  prefs
editor of MBE. There are only three differences:

1. The developer prefs editor  has  a  'New'  button  to  create  a  new
  MBE-image.

2. The developer prefs editor has a string gadget  for  the  ID  of  the
  MBE-image and not just a text gadget.

3. The of the about requester is different ;-)


Giving an ID
************

Every MBE-image ID is a longword. You  have  to  take  your  MUI  serial
number  as  upper  word but you mustn't set the highest bit. So you have
65536 different ID's.

Of course the MBE-image ID must be unique.


Example
-------

Let's think of the serial number 12345.

    1.    : ( 12345 << 16 )         = 0x30390000 = 809041920
    2.    : ( 12345 << 16 ) | 1     = 0x30390001 = 809041921
    3.    : ( 12345 << 16 ) | 2     = 0x30390002 = 809041922
    .
    .
    .
    65536.: ( 12345 << 16 ) | 65535 = 0x3039FFFF = 809107455


Creating an MBE-object
**********************

First you have to include the include file  'MBE_mcc.h'.  Then  you  can
create an MBE-object using macros.

Examples
--------

mbe_button = MBEObject,
  ButtonFrame,
  MUIA_Background, MUII_ButtonBack,
  MUIA_InputMode, MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify,
  MUIA_MBE_ID, MY_ID,
End,

mbe_button = MBEButton( MY_ID )

mbe_image = MBEImage( MY_ID )


Distributing an MBE Application
*******************************

If you distribute an MBE-Application you either have to include the  MBE
archive  into  your  archive (Its size is less than 40K.) or the user of
your application has to get it her/himself.

Of course  you  have  to  include  an  MBE  prefs  file  describing  the
MBE-images  that  are needed for your application. If it is useful, you
can include the MUI-brushes for these MBE-images, too.

Don't forget to send me this application on disk :)
