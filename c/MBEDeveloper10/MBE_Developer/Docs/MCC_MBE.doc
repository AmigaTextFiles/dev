    MBE class allows the user and the programmer to have more images
    than the predefined MUI-images. The user can change the look of
    these MBE-images in a comfortable way by using the MBE preferences
    program.

    The only thing the programmer has to do is to specify an ID of its
    MBE-image - so the code will be kept very short.
    
    Since MBE class is a subclass of Image class (and Image class is a
    subclass of Area class) you can use all the other things like frames
    or backgrounds. See MUIA_MBE_ID for example code.

    Please read the manual of MBE and the developer documentation for
    more information.

    NAME
        MUIA_MBE_ID -- [I..], ULONG

    FUNCTION
        Specify the MBE-image by its ID-logword.

        This is the only attribute of MBE class. Since MBE class is a
        subclass of image it's only possible to pass this attribute at
        object creation time.

    EXAMPLE
        
        /* Create an 'play' button with MBE-image: */

        mbe_button = MBEObject,
            ButtonFrame,
            MUIA_InputMode, MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify,
            MUIA_Background, MUII_ButtonBack,
            MUIA_MBE_ID, MBEB_TapePlay,
          End,
