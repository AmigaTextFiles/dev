Changes

03/21/92 v2.24
	Fixed Arexx result code if function is not available.  Returns
	rm_Result1=5, rm_Result2=1.

	Changed it so it will not quit if it can't open lc's error file,
	it will just do nothing.

	Changed the order of some of the code.

	If you are using WShell 2.0 you must use BRKMODE#2 so Sas2Ced can
	find the WShell window when compiling.


09/20/91 v2.20
	The Arexx port has a new command: compile <path> <command>
	Compile tries to find a shell in the system that has a
	current directory the same a <path>, if one is found
	<command> is executed in it.  With this sas2ced fully
	intergrates Sas/C to Ced.

	compile.s2c arexx script is included.

	Next error requester will now appear directly above the error
	or directly below if it can not fit above.  Basiclly the cursor
	will never be covered.

	Added a command line option for the path to look for an
	include file if it can not be found.

	Changed the name of the sas2ced arexx port from 'sas2ced'
	to 'SAS2CED' to comform to the Amiga User Style Guide.


05/07/91 v2.00 & v1.20	
	V2.00 is the same as v1.20, but v2.00 only runs under
	AmigaDOS 2.0.  V2.00 uses 2.0 system calls to make it
	smaller and faster.

	Added logic so Ced will not be pulled to the front if an
	invald filename is given to LC.

	Changed it so Ced will not be pulled to the front if you
	press ctrl-c while compiling.

	Changed quitting Sas2Ced from ctrl-f to ctrl-c.		


03/12/91 v1.10
	I added better logic to check to see if a file is already open.

	I also added three command line options.
	next- (default) next error requester comes up if an error is found
	show- showerrors requester comes up if an error is found
	quiet-no requester comes up, just moves cursor to first error


02/01/91 v1.00
	Release of version 1.00
