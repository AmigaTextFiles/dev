 Definition of the 'RPortVPort' output type
--------------------------------------------

1.WHY ANOTHER OUTPUT TYPE?

It gives more control on rendering process and is more general than
'Window' output type.  Output handler renders the graphics into specified
RastPort at the given coordinates and with the given size.  It can be used
for both normal and off-screen rendering.

For now it is used by MUI Mesa class so MUI programs will work only with
handlers supporting 'RPortVPort'.


2.HOW TO USE IT?

Use the following structure:

struct RPortVPort
{
struct RastPort *RPort; // RastPort where to render
struct ViewPort *VPort; // ViewPort associated with display
long LeftEdge,TopEdge;  // coordinates
long Width,Height;      // drawing area size
};

Before rendering, you have to specify OH_Output as pointer to struct
RPortVPort (could also be done in CreateContext).
Any time you can set OH_Output to NULL pointer (or set RPort/VPort to
NULL), this means your previous rendering environment is no longer valid
and the handler will free any resources associated with it (eg. you
want to close/iconify the window preserving the GL context).


3.HOW TO WRITE A HANDLER?

See the supplied sources - 'grey' is very simple handler, that supports both
"window" and "rportvport" outputs.
Hints:  The structure you get in InitOutputHandler() or Set...Attrs()
should be copied in the private buffer.  If it is NULL, assume RPort and
VPort are NULL (you have to free any resources before leaving Set...Attrs()
in that case). The handler don't have to return OH_Width/Height values.
