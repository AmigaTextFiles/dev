These are header files that I put together since the real header files are
copyrighted.  You can use the real files instead if you have access to them.

The real device.h works fine.  The real gl.h would need modifications:

1. The Device, Object, Tag typedef's must be removed.

2. The prototypes should be replaced by: #include"usr:src/agl/prototypes.h"

                                                                  Jason
