GoldED Indent
=============

Hiya folks, here are two small macros to indent C sourcecode via GoldED.
It uses the Gnu Indent programm, available e.g on aminet in /dev/c/...
Usage is quite simple. Copy these two files to GoldED:Arexx/ and set them
up e.g by building a new menu entry for them. Set the entry to e.g

    GOLDED:ARexx/blockindent.ged

and switch the Radio Button to ARexx.

1.) blockindent.ged

    Mark a block of sourcecode, it's recommended to mark a whole function
    as a block, otherwise it won't work. Now select the menu entry you've
    created for this script. The script will make a temporary copy of this
    block, it runs indent over this copy, deletes the old block and inserts
    the new one. In the end it'll delete the temporary copies.

2.) sourceindent.ged

    This will mark the whole sourcecode as a block and will handle it like
    in 1.)

Somethings you'd like to change in these macros.
================================================

a.) The temporary path.

    This path is set to dtmp:, but you could set it to t: or whatever you'd
    like.

b.) The temporary filenames

    They're golded.indent for the copy and golded.new for the indented
    new version.

c.) The options for indent.

    I've set them to e.g -br (put the brackets behind e.g if-else 
    constructions), -i4 (set tab indentation to 4 spaces). For the rest
    of my options take a look at the indent documentation.

Legal stuff:
============

This is just a little hack I've done for my personal use, if you'd like to
use it you can simply DO it, this stuff is PD, change it or leave it or
throw it away. I won't take any responsibility for any lost files or any
damage done with these scripts. If you're changing these files in a way
that you think they're working better than now, please send me a copy.
