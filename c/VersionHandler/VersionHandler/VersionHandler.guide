@NODE SystemRequirements "System Requirements"
@TOC Main

    This program requires at least version V39 of the operating system software.  This is to take advantage of the new commands and new tags.  It is now easy enough to update your system so it should not pose a problem.

    This program requires less than 512K of RAM, therefore it should operate on all systems.

    To use the full potential, a harddrive is recommended but not required.

    Thanks to Olaf `Olsen' Barthel, author of gtlayout.library.  It is by far the best user interface package.

    The user interface is totally font and screen mode sensitive.  All gadgets and the window will automatically adjust to match your preferences.

    The latest features are utilized to get the most from the operating system and to make the program the best of it's kind.

@ENDNODE


@NODE LocaleSupport "Locale Support"
@TOC Main

    This is program is totally localized to allow support for foreign languages.  A catalog may not be available for your language at this time, but one will hopefully be available soon.

    If you are willing to translate the strings to another language, please let me know.  If you do offer, a perfect translation of all strings will be expected.  It is all or nothing.  I will also be seeking your assistance for future versions that have new strings.

@ENDNODE


@NODE OperationNotes "Operation Notes"
@TOC Main

    The Load Preferences and Save Preferences menus load/save the Project Name and Project Path.

    The Load and Save gadgets load/save only the version statistics.

    If you specify AUTOBUMP, VERSION, DATE, or TIME the user interface will not be opened.

    If you want support for other programming languages, send me several example files with comments with everything that is included in the C version.

    Press the Help key for AmigaGuide help.

    It can be started in WBStartup and iconified so it is always available.

@NODE ReportingBugs "Reporting Bugs"
@TOC Main

    I try to make sure all new additions or changes work correctly before releasing a new version, but, something might get by.  If you encounter a bug or a problem with hardware or other programs, please let me know.  Do not assume it will be fixed in the next version because if no one tells me, I may not find it.

    Please be very specific about what the bug does, when it does it, how you found it, and how I can re-create it to test it.  Also let me know what your system consists of: Kickstart version, hard-drives, memory expansion, accelerator card, chip set (original, ECS, AGA), etc.

    If you find a program that is not compatible with this program, please send it to me on a disk or via electronic mail.
