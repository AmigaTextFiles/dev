	Exciting news for anyone interested in programming the Amiga
computer at any level -- beginner through expert!  For years DICE has been
a respected name in the Amiga
programming community. Now some of the biggest names in Amiga programming
have combined talents to make DICE even better.  The new DICE is fast,
cheap, easy and fun.

	DICE has always been a good C language compiler.  Now the DICE
compiler is part of an integrated "system" of programming tools designed to
ease and speed creating programs for the Amiga.  If you are a beginner DICE
offers an intuitive visual approach to creating programs -- and numerous
examples to get you started.  Programmers of all levels will appreciate how
DICE seamlessly integrates with your favorite text editor, offering tools
and information at the touch of a button.

	The new DICE focuses on _productivity_.  Not just a buzzword, the
DICE system focuses on getting code from keyboard to execution as quickly
as possible.  We give you a quick development cycle and fast compile time
so you can try new things quickly.  We bring all help online so you don't
waste time flipping through the manual.

The new DICE includes:
	o Complete 450 page manual, including a section on avoiding
	  the most common programming pitfalls.
	o Full, fast, online help.
	o A complete visual compile environment (that, incidentally is
	  fully configurable to provide a visual environment for any
	  program).
	o All the updates, fixes and enhancements you'd expect to the
	  original.
	o A simple source line debugger - the most asked for features
	  in an easy to use package.
	o A Compression system for use on floppy disk systems.
	o Full source code for the libraries and dozens of examples.
	o A package of "bonus" tools to help find bugs in your code.

	DICE is brought to you by some of the biggest names in Amiga
programming; we know the Amiga inside and out.  We call ourselves "Obvious
Implementations Corporation," and our founding members are Matt Dillon (well
known shareware author), John Toebes (Director of the Software Distillery),
Bryce Nesbitt (Enforcer and longtime system software Guru for Commodore-Amiga),
Andy Finkel (Amiga Shell, Amiga MicroEmacs and also longtime head of software
development for Commodore-Amiga) and many well known friends.

	We've priced DICE ridiculously low - there is no excuse not to delay
ordering.  The new DICE is available for immediate shipping.  Pricing in US
funds (shipping and handling are free):

     $75	For owners of the registered version of DICE
     $90	For SAS/C Owners	(Provide your SAS/C serial number)
     $90	for Students		(Send a photocopy of student ID or

     $150	For a new purchase
          N.C. Residents must add 6% sales tax

DICE error messages and screens are available in German, French and
English. The manual is English only, sorry.  Additional languages may be
added in the future.
