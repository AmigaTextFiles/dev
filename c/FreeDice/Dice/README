    Please read COPYRIGHT.DOC for info on all copyrights, trademarks, and
    other items refered to an included in the DICE distribution.  This file
    exists on both distribution disks.

    This is the public distribution release for DICE.  Under no
    circumstances may you redistribute a modified version of the
    distribution.  Period. No exceptions (please?).  I cannot allow this to
    get out of control.  Neither may any redistribution for profit be made
    (you can charge up to $6 beyond your cost for your time)

    DICE consists of a frontend, preprocessor, C compiler, assembler, and
    linker, and support libraries all written by myself.  A generated
    (non-commodore) 2.0 amiga.lib is included with this distribution.  Note
    that you may compile 1.3 programs with the 2.0 amiga.lib as long as
    you avoid 2.0-specific calls.

    Source to the DICE binaries is not included (Most except the compiler,
    linker, and assembler are included in the commercial version)

    Source to C*.LIB and other link libraries is not included for the
    Freeware version ... they are included for the commercial version.

    DICE also includes my DMAKE make utility (though it should be noted
    that DMAKE is extremely difficult to learn how to use).  Source is not
    available (it isn't fit to be distributed).  DMAKE works best running
    under 2.0 due to the available of new system calls.

    This is the unregistered FreeWare version.	If you find yourself using
    DICE seriously, you should consider the commercial version. Refer to the
    doc/REGISTER.DOC for information on commercial version.

    This is the unregistered FreeWare version of DICE, obtained from the
    public nets, and it is missing one vital item:  the AMIGA INCLUDES.
    Most developers will already have these but if you do not you can
    obtain them from the Commodore Amiga Technical Support group:

	Commodore
	Dept. C
	1200 Wilson Drive
	West Chester, PA.  19380
	USA

	(215)431-9100

    *** TO PURCHASE THE AMIGA INCLUDES **

	Include a check for $20 and request that you want the AmigaDOS V1.3
	Native Developer Update.  THIS IS A NEW ADDRESS.  THE OLD CATS ADDRESS
	NO LONGER HANDLES SUPPORT MATERIAL PURCHASES.

	NOTE THAT THE AMIGA INCLUDES AND LIBRARIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE
	COMMERCIAL VERSION OF DICE, BUT THE AUTODOCS ARE NOT.  THEREFORE,
	IF YOU INTEND TO PURCHASE IT YOU PROBABLY DO *NOT* WANT TO PURCHASE
	THE NATIVE DEVELOPER UPDATE FROM COMMODORE.

    ***

    NOTE:   The unregistered version of DICE comes with an AMIGAS13.LIB
	    library which implements most of the 1.3 AMIGA.LIB, and
	    AMIGAS20.LIB which implements most of the 2.0 AMIGA.LIB. Some
	    Functions, such as afp(), CreateTask(), and DeleteTask() are
	    missing. The utility FDTOLIB was used to generate the library
	    from the 1.3 and 2.0 .FD files plus some additional source.
	    (part of the commercial distribution)

    NOTE:   without the commodore includes you are somewhat limited in
	    what you can do with the freeware version.	Note that the
	    Commercial version comes with the commodore includes and full
	    amiga.lib .  Since the Commodore includes are Commodore's, I
	    cannot distribute them freely, only through my license which
	    restricts distribution to the Commercial version of DICE.

    IF YOU OBTAIN THE COMMODORE AMIGA.LIB, you will want to use it to
    get whatever was left out in the distributed compatible.  To use
    the commodore amiga.lib, you must run it through the LIBTOS program:

	1> libtos amiga.lib dlib:amigas13.lib		(1.3 amiga.lib)
	1> libtos amiga.lib dlib:amigas20.lib		(2.0 amiga.lib)

	(note that 's' in the destination name -- small-data model version
	of amiga.lib is called amigas.lib).

	Since the commodore amiga.lib is more complete than the ones
	distributed here you will want to do this if you have them.

    --------------------------	SETTING UP DICE  -------------------------

    DICE requires a few things to be set up properly.  There are two
    principle assignments:

    DINCLUDE:	    assign to DICE's include directory
    DLIB:	    assign to DICE's dlib directory

    and there is one enviroment variable

    ENV:DCCOPTS     DCC core compiler options

    Specifically, you want one of the following in your startup-sequence
    to set up the DCCOPTS enviroment variable.	Since only the 2.0 amiga.lib
    is included you must specify the -2.0 option or DICE will be unable to
    link.

    1> setenv DCCOPTS "-2.0"
    1> setenv DCCOPTS "-2.0 -f"

    You can use "-f" ONLY if you are running the standard commodore shell,
    this speeds up execution of RESIDENT DICE executables as well as hacks
    in ^C handling under 1.3.  The -f option has no effect under 2.0

    DICE uses the -1.3/-2.0 option to define it's search path for the
    includes and amiga.lib.  If -1.3 is selected, DINCLUDE:AMIGA13 is added
    to the includes search path and DLIB:AMIGAS13.LIB is used for the
    amiga.lib.	If -2.0 is selected, DINCLUDE:AMIGA20 is adde to the
    includes search path and DLIB:AMIGAS20.LIB is used for the amiga.lib ..
    the freeware release of DICE cannot include these commodore includes.

    If you have obtained the amiga includes, you want to set them up as
    follows (example for the 1.3 includes):

	DINCLUDE:			(ANSI DICE and other DICE includes)
	DINCLUDE:AMIGA13/		where the 1.3 includes go
	DINCLUDE:AMIGA13/EXEC/*.H	       .
	DINCLUDE:AMIGA13/LIBRARIES/*.H	       .
	    etc...

    Basically you Copy Includes1.3: DINCLUDE:AMIGA13 CLONE ALL
    (or similar copy for the 2.0 includes if you have them)

    If you obtain the 1.3 amiga.lib from commodore you may create DICE
    compatible amiga.lib's by:

	copy amiga.lib dlib:
	cd dlib:
	rename amiga.lib amigal13.lib	    ; convert to DICE nomenclature
	libtos amigal13.lib amigas13.lib    ; generate small-data version

    If you obtain and setup the commodore 1.3 includes/amiga.lib you will
    want to change your DCCOPTS '-2.0' option to '-1.3' so DICE can find
    them.  If, on the otherhand, you obtain the commodore 2.0
    includes/amiga.lib you will want to leave DCCOPTS set to '-2.0'.


    --------------------------	DYNAMIC.LIBRARY  -------------------------

    The subdirectory 'dynamic' contains a new dynamic object management
    library to go with DICE's new __dynamic keyword.  If you are interested
    in fooling around with it please CD into dynamic and read the
    documentation, and try out some of the test programs in DYNAMIC/BIN/

    Note that this may be lharc'd.  To unarchive:

    1> lharc -r -x -a x dynamic

    dynamic.library may be more of use for machine-global shared variables
    then for machine-global shared subroutines.
