	Using AmigaGuide AutoDocs inside SE
	-----------------------------------
	
	In order to accomplish this task you should have:
	
	- SAS/C v6.50+ fully installed
	- Amiga AutoDocs (.doc files) from Commodore
	- ARexx
	- AD2AG from Commodore
	
	You can find both AD2AG and the Amiga AutoDocs for v40.68 in the Amiga Developer CD v1.1. GET THIS CD!
It is ESSENTIAL in order to program the Amiga correctly.

	Updating your SE:
	-----------------
	
	1. Copy the supplied file "man.se" in your SC:Rexx directory.
	2. Load up SE and select the Configuration Screen. Assign to a key the macro
				RM "sc:rexx/man.se"
	3. Select SAVE.
	
	Now everytime the cursor is in an Amiga or library function, by pressing the assigned key you will
get information about the specified function.

	Creating the AmigaGuide AutoDocs
	--------------------------------
	
	1. Copy ALL your AutoDocs in a directory. The files should have the filename extension .doc.
	2. CD to that directory.
	3. Type (in a Shell): 		AD2AG "" xref Include Include:
		(don't forget the "" or the program will complain about missing AutoDocs). The program will scan
		ALL the autodocs in current directory and the include files in your Include: assign. It will create
		the Cross-Reference file "autodocs.xref".
	4. Now, type again in the Shell:
				AD2AG "" TO <destination-directory> XRefFile autodocs.xref Contents AutoDocs.guide
	   The program will start the conversion progress. Be warned: if you have A LOT of autodocs, this
	   operation will take some time. On my A3000/25 for all the Amiga AutoDocs & MUI AutoDocs, it took
	   about 40 minutes.
	   
	   After the conversion is over, you'll find in the <destination-directory> ALL your AutoDocs files in
	   AmigaGuide format, PLUS the file AutoDocs.guide which will contain listings of all your autodocs functions.
	
	5. Copy the file "AutoDocs.XRef" to the directory where the Autodocs.Guide file is.
	   
	   NOTE: it is advised that <destination-directory> should be SC:Help/AutoDocs; otherwise you'll have to
	   change the decleration in the file "man.se" in order to find the file "AutoDocs.guide".
