                   AMIGA C ENCYCLOPEDIA

                           V3.0

The Amiga C Encyclopedia is the largest collection of documents,
examples and utilities in C for the Amiga. It consists of six
manuals with more than 40 chapters, 175 fully executable
examples complete with source code and several utilities and
other goodies. It all adds up to a complete work on how to
program in C on the Amiga.

All documents, examples, and programs can easily be accessed
from Workbench. The Amiga C Encyclopedia consists of simple as
well as complex examples, which go deeper into each subject
than any other manual. The Amiga C Encyclopedia can both be
read as a tutorial and as a reference manual.
 
The Amiga C Encyclopedia is completely compatible with both
Amiga Dos version 1.3 and 2.x. The manuals can be used on any
Amiga with 512 KB or more, and can easily be installed on a
hard disk.

The programs are written in SAS (Lattice) C V5.10, but will
compile perfectly with older versions, as well as with other
C compilers. All programs and examples follow Commodore's
programming recommendations. They contain full error checking
and return all allocated resources.

Everything is stored on 12 disks. This means that you will save
weeks of work since you do not have to type in the examples
yourself. You can directly run the already compiled programs,
or immediately start to experiment with the source code.
Programming should be fun!

       THE AMIGA C ENCYCLOPEDIA CONSISTS OF SIX MANUALS

                          AMIGA

This manual contains general information about C and the Amiga.
It prepares the reader and explains all necessary things a
programmer must know before he/she can start to write programs
for the Amiga. Useful hints and tips are explained and some
useful tools are included.

This manual also contains ten extensive appendices; complete
table of contents, all described functions and all given
examples are listed, ASCII and Raw Key Code tables,
explanations of the Guru Meditation Codes, information about
normal as well as binary operators in C, and a lot  more...

                        INTUITION

Almost everything you need to know about Intuition is explained
in this manual. Screens, Windows, Graphics, Gadgets, Requesters,
Alerts, Menus and IDCMP are described in every detail. Complete
with more than 70 examples.

In this manual you will also find a powerful file requester and
a useful colour requester which both easily can be included in
your own programs. A lot of extra information about Intuition
and other goodies are also included.

                        GRAPHICS

This third manual describes how to use the unique and complex
graphical routines in the Amiga. It covers the Low Level
Graphical routines, describes how to use and load different
types of Fonts, explains how to handle hardware Sprites as well
as VSprites. Also included is a huge chapter about BOBs and how
to use the special collision routines, a lot of graphical
tricks like text and map Scrolling as well as information about
the Blitter. If all this would not be enough, a unique set of
3D routines are included as well as a lot of documentation
about the Copper.

A useful utility which converts normal disk fonts into C code
is also included together with a unique Copper designer tool
with which spectacular copper lists easily can be created. 

                         SYSTEM

This manual describes how the Amiga's operating system and
hardware are working and explains the AmigaDos file system. It
also includes information about the system lists, how to use
message ports and send messages between programs, and a lot of
other useful stuff like hardware hacks and dirty input
routines.

                         DEVICES

The special Amiga devices are explained in this fifth manual.
All these devices are fully covered: Timer, Gameport, Audio,
Narrator, Trackdisk, Serial, Parallel and Printer. Complete
with information about how to handle both synchronous and
asynchronous requests. These chapters are extremely useful if
you are serious about programming on the Amiga. Everything from
simply checking the time to printing graphics is explained.

Several useful routines which easily can be used are also
included in most chapters. With these routines together with
the documentation you can very quickly start to use the
technically advanced parts in the Amiga.

                          SOUND

This currently last manual consists of two very useful and easy
to handle sound utilities. The first utility, EasySound, is
used to load and play sampled sound effects. It has been
completely rewritten and can now be used to control almost all
aspects of the sound. The second utility is used to convert
sound effects into C code which then easily can be included in
your own programs. 

In this manual you will also find a nice collection of almost
all different types of presampled sound effects which can be
used in your own programs and games. 

                AND MUCH, MUCH, MUCH MORE...

    HOW TO ACQUIRE THE COMPLETE AMIGA C ENCYCLOPEDIA

These disks contain almost the entire encyclopedia. To get the
last parts that cover BOBs, 3D routines, Copper lists and
Graphical Tricks, you simply register your copy.

The registration fee is only 30, $60, SEK 300, or similar
amount in your own currency (price includes everything). The
Amiga C Encyclopedia is the largest collection of documents,
examples and utilities in C for the Amiga and it is still among
the cheapest manuals. But this is not all, a registered owner
will also get:

  1. Two disks containing the last parts of the encyclopedia.
     The disks will be sent by first class air mail.

  2. Registration card for the Amiga C Club (ACC).

  3. Immediate information about updates.

  4. Updated versions of the encyclopedia for only the cost of
     disks plus postage and packing.

  5. Assistance with digitizing colour pictures and sampling
     sound effects.

  6. Unlimited help with your C programs. You never have to be
     alone with your problems.

  7. The right to use parts of the manual in your own
     commercial/non-commercial programs/articles.

Can any other manual give you all this???

The simplest way of paying is to include the money in a letter
in cash. US dollar bills, English pounds or Swedish SEK are
preferred, but all currencies are accepted. You can also send
the money as a "Postal Money Order", ask your local bank or
post office. Please do not use cheques. It is sadly extremely
expensive to cash a foreign cheque here in Sweden.

If you live in Scandinavia you can send the money to "Svenska
Post Girot, postgiro konto: 641 88 30 - 3, betalnings-
mottagare: Datra".

Please send the registration fee together with your complete
address to:

  Datra, Amiga C Club

I have worked for more than four years now with this
encyclopedia, and with your help I can continue to improve it.

Happy programming!!!
