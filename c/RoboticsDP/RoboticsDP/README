Robotics Developer Pack (RDP) brings robotics, automation, and
animatronics into the Amiga world. RDP provides minissc library,
a full library documentation, necessary C/C++ include files, 3 example 
programs (C source codes and executable binary files included), RDP 
developer manual, and Mini SSC II controller documentation &

of robot kits (arms, wheeled robots, legged robots, wheeled robots with
arms...) and animatronics available which are based on Mini SSC II

and the robot is under your control!
