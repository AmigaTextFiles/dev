 INTRODUCTION


 Robotics Developer Pack (RDP) brings robotics, automation, and animatronics
 into the Amiga world. RDP provides minissc library, a full library
 documentation, necessary C/C++ include files, 3 example programs (C source
 codes and executable binary files included), RDP developer manual, and Mini
 SSC II controller documentation & presentation.

 Minissc library is designed for controlling standard R/C servos through the
 popular Mini SSC II serial servo controller. There are tens of robot kits
 (arms, wheeled robots, legged robots, wheeled robots with arms...) and
 animatronics available which are based on Mini SSC II controller. Just plug
 the controller's cable into the Amiga serial port and the robot is under your
 control!

 The Robotics Developer Pack is a freeware [AMITY] product.

 INSTALLATION


 @{b}Requirements@{ub}
 
  · about 7-800 kB of free disk space
  · @{"Installer version 44.10" link "Requirements" 37}

 @{b}How to install Robotics Developer Pack on hard disk?@{ub}

 Just double-click the 'Install' icon and follow the given instructions.

 The cover picture, installer script, readme files, and other notes are not
 essential, and that is why they are not installed by the script. If you would
 like to have them on your hard disk, you have to copy them manually.

 @{b}How to test minissc.library without installing it?@{ub}

 Just double-click 'Preview' icon. Script will make a temporary assign to the
 local library directory where minissc.library is located. Then it shows
 information about how Mini SSC II controller should be configured and waits
 until you have done the required modifications, executes LowRateScan example
 program in order to demonstrate servo control, and finaly it removes
 temporary assign made at the beginning.

 @{b}No required installer!?@{ub}

 If you cannot use Installer version 44.10, for one reason or another, you
 have to make the installation manually.

 Create somewhere on your hard disk a directory 'RoboticsDP' and copy there
 all RoboticsDP directories and files except 'Include' and 'Libs'
 directories. Locate your C/C++ compiler's 'Include' directory and copy there
 all directories and files from the RoboticsDP's 'Include' directory. Finally
 copy minissc.library from the 'Libs' directory to the system's 'LIBS:'.

 BUGS/LIMITATIONS


 @{b}Bug reports@{ub}

 If you think the minissc library doesn't work as it's supposed to, please
 send me mail describing the problem so that I can make RoboticsDP into a
 better product.

 @{b}Limitations@{ub}

 · Due to Mini SSC II hardware limitations, minissc library can never know for
   sure the actual settings of Mini SSC II controller or actual servo
   positions.
 · Servos modified for continuous rotation are not currently supported.

 HINT

 IF SOMEONE SENDS ME A MODIFIED SERVO, I WILL ADD SUPPORT FOR THOSE SERVOS IN
 MINISSC LIBRARY.
