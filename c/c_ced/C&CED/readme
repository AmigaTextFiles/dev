These are some utilities for Cygnus Ed for the C programmer.

	ADLookup	- a function lookup for autodocs
	ADInd		- makes the index for the autodoc lookup

	GetStruct	- a C structure (or E object) lookup
	ParseInc	- makes the index for GetStruct

	LibAdd.rexx - adds some ARexx support libraries.  Some of the
					scripts require rexxarplib.library for the
					filelist() function.  Run this script after you
					start the Rexx server.

You are welcome to modify these.  But include the original scripts and
documentation in any distribution.
