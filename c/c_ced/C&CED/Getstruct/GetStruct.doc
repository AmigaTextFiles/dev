   WHAT IT IS
   ~~~~~~~~~~
GetStruct is a structure/object lookup routine for Cygnus Ed.  Hit a
function key, pull up the include/header/object file that contains
that structure or object and place the cursor on it.


   WHAT YOU NEED
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
header files
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Either the C= header (*.h) or include (*.i) files or the ascii version
of the E object files (*.e).  AmigaEdocs.LHA archive contains the
*.txt files or you can ShowModule the individual *.m files.  You'll
have to rename the *.txt files to *.e if you use the AmigaEdocs.LHA
archive.

some assigns
~~~~~~~~~~~~
include_h: <dir that has the *.h files>
include_i: <dir that has the *.i files>
include_e: <dir that has the *.e files>

   ie > ls include_h:
        clib   
        devices
         ...

index files
~~~~~~~~~~~
Each directory needs an INDEX file.  ParseInc builds these:
      parseinc h >include_h:INDEX
      parseinc e >include_e:INDEX
      parseinc i >include_i:INDEX
'parseinc ?' will remind you of the usage.

Cygnus Ed F-Key assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Put GetStruct.ced in REXX:  and assign a CED function key (or macro)
to:

   rexx:getstruct h  ('i' for the asm includes or 'e' for the E objects)

That should do it.


   SOME POSSIBLE PROBLEMS
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
nothing happens when you hit the function key
   - you may need to set the script bit on REXX:GetStruct.ced or
     use 'rx' in the CED key assignment

CED requester says something like 'can't find include_x:INDEX'
   - include_x: isn't assigned
   - ParseInc hasn't been used to build the INDEX file

ParseInc won't run
   - it requires rexxarplib.library (and arp.library) for the
     filelist() function

the include file gets loaded, but the cursor isn't being positioned on
the structure name.
   - 'uc==lc?' is toggled off in the search requester
   - you may have to alter the search statements at the end of
     the script.
