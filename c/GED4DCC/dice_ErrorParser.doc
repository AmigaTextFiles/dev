 We handle the following Rexx Commands:

     QUIT
          Terminate the error parser

     NEXT    <stem>

          Advance the current pointers to  the  next  entry.  If  nothing  is
          active, we wrap around to the beginning again

     FIRST   <stem>

          Go to the first error

     PREV    <stem>

          Advance the current pointers to the previous entry. If  we  are  at
          the beginning, don't do anything.

     CURRENT <stem>

          Return information on the current error

     CLEAR

          Clear out all errors stored

     TTXSAME "<file>" "<project>" "<macro>"

          Load a file into the error parsing. A string containing  the  lines
          which  correspond  to the source is returned. This string is not to
          be freed.

     LOAD    "<error>" "<dir>" "<sourcefile>" <args>

          Load errors into the parser


 Where <stem> Is any valid rexx variable name and it will contain the
 following on return:

     FILE:   The name of the file to edit

     DIR:    The directory that the file is relative to

     ARGS:   The REXX arguments associated with the compile command
