This is a native Amiga port (no ixemul.library required) of ICU,
IBM's International Classes For Unicode

INSTALLATION:


a.FULL INSTALLATION:

  (For use with ICU clients such as Jikes, and for development using gcc.)

  Copy the contents of the bin, include, lib, and share directories to
  GG:bin, gg:include, gg:lib, and GG:share, respectively. Set your stack
  to 30000 if you want to use the tools in the bin directory.


b.PARTIAL INSTALLATION:

  (For use with ICU clients such as Jikes.)

  Copy the contents of share/icu/1.3.1 to a directory on your hard
  drive. If you install them in GG:share/icu/1.3.1, then the files will
  be found automatically. If you install them elsewhere, then set the
  environment variable ICU_DATA to point to that directory.  Make sure
  you include the trailing slash in the directory name. (E.g., if you
  install the files in Work:icu, use "setenv ICU_DATA Work:icu/".) If
  you are short on space, you can install only convrtrs.txt and the
  .cnv files corresponding to the encodings you want to use. (E.g.,
  if you are interested in using the iso-8859-7 encoding, you can see
  by looking at convrtrs.txt that you need ibm-4909.cnv.)
