Hi Tim thanks for your mail that I got on 15-Dec-99

Somebody sent a test program to the list a while back. 
I tested it on my 060 and it appeared to be responding
to all buttons fine!  And the games which do use the
lowlevel.library all work fine (AFAIK).  I think
Wipeout2097 uses lowlevel.library on PPC? - The demo
was perfect on my machine.

Hope this is of help - I'll be willing to test your
code on my machine.  Contact me direct before sending
anything though :)

Cheers,

Is the shorthand format defined? Or is this up to the implementer? I'm asking
because the standard StormC link library prints 'Jan 01 2000' where the
StormAmiga link lib outputs '01/01/00'. IMHO the first isn't really shorthand
notation...

Hello,
     Im trying to implement a module system. Each module
implements defined function. They will be compiled as object code by the

But How do I call the function that is in the loaded object code.

Kind regards

The term "shorthand" comes from the Hisoft C++ docs, I'm not sure if
it's correct or not. As for the format, Hisoft should print out this
format "Jan 01 2000", but because of a Y2K bug, instead gives "Jan 01
20". :-/

Really?  You got your 6.58 SE to change the text colors?  I can't even
get mine to do that.  The menu item for setting/selecting how SE displays
C source code doesn't even show up anymore.  I told the guy that was 
taking care of the SAS-C updates about this, but he didn't seem to know 
what I was complaining about.  It would be helpful if there was some 
documentation on how the se.dat file is constructed.  Saving the changes 
I make to SE's configuration seem to cause the OS (V3.5) some sort of 
grief since it slows down & finally recovers.

From: Allan Odgaard <Duff@DIKU.DK>
Date: 01-02-00 13:02:04
Subject: @{b}A virtual delete operator?@{ub}

Hi there,

Imagine I overload new & delete for my Dummy-class. Then I create a subclass
where I do the same. Now if I delete an instance of the subclass, but with the
pointer declared as 'class Dummy *' then the delete operator of my superclass
is invoked.  Normally I'd declare a function 'virtual' to avoid this problem,
but that doesn't seem to be possible for the delete operator (only the
destructor) -- so what should I do?

I attached a small program to illustrate the problem better. It prints:
   Super-alloc 0 bytes
   Sub-alloc 0 bytes
   Super-Free 0 bytes at 099e639c
   Super-Free 0 bytes at 099e6394
But I want it to say:
   Super-alloc 0 bytes
   Sub-alloc 0 bytes
   Sub-Free 0 bytes at 099e639c
   Super-Free 0 bytes at 099e6394

Create a library instead,  unless you are trying to impliment  
some sort of  executable  "plug-in"  type system.

If so, LoadSeg() only works on executable objects,
it returns a BPTR to the segment.

Convert it to an (APTR) by:     (ulong)pointer <<=2;

A BCPL pointer to the next segment is at  pointer.
(or NULL if no next segment exists)
 
The first instruction begins at  4 bytes past the 
(APRT) converted pointer.

You had better do the startup code in ASM.....

Subject: @{b}SAS/C Date Problem@{ub}

From: Bablos <bablos@cableinet.co.uk>

Hi There...

As a number of you will probably know, there's a problem with using
__AMIGADATE__ in SAS/C.  I'm using 6.58, and include the __AMIGADATE__
as a part of the version string.

Today , 2nd Jan 2000, shows up as (2.1.0), which looks more like the
programs version number.

Is there a way around this?  Ideally, I'd like it to say (02.01.2000).  I
just wonder if there's a special little routine hidden away somewhere
which could rectify the problem.

Hope someone can help...

Subject: @{b}AmigaOS 3.5 & ReadPixelLine8()@{ub}

From: Niels de Koning <ndk@bart.nl>

Hi!

Since I have installed AmigaOS 3.5 one of the command line tools I 
wrote no longer works as I intended. I have been trying to figure
out what is going on but I have to admit that the absence of a
nice debug tool is driving me slightly mad.

Problem description:
When I read a pixelline from a datatype picture object the 
pixelvalues I get are all zeroes!

In more detail:
When I use the ReadPixelLine8() function I expect to get an array with
values that indicate which palette entry was used for a certain pixel.
Before my OS3.5 installation this worked as I expected. Now it no longer
works and I have NO IDEA why.

Does anybody have any idea what I am doing wrong or who I can ask for
help. If you want to see the C-sourcecode let me know and I'll mail it.

Anyone? please?

btw. The source is for a (very little:-) program that counts the 
number of unique colors in a picture that is loaded through the 
Amiga's datatype system.

Best regards,
// Niels de Koning

functions take doubles and floats as parameters.  An example Autodoc entry 
is below.

My question is how do I specify the registers the doubles and floats will 
use?  Does a double take up two CPU data registers?  If it is an array of 
doubles, do I use an address register like for a pointer?

Also, I'd like to have this library be able to use an FPU, I know that the 
SAS/C fd2pragma utility will not handle the FP0 - FP7 registers in the FPU 
correctly and I will have to do that manually.  For the autodoc entry, is 
FP0 an acceptable register to specify?

If there is a specific passage in the SAS/C Manual, RKM's, or Guru Book 
concerning these issues please give me a page number.  

Thanks!

Is there a function in linux equivalent to FPrintf() under AmigaOS? I

Errrm... fprintf() - it's a standard ANSI C function.  Of course, you
must also use fopen() to open the files, instead of DOS Open().

Just for future reference, the new and delete operators for a class are
automatically made static, and static functions can not be virtual. They
are defined as being static because they are invoked before and after the
life-time of an object!

To solve the problem, you just need to define a virtual destructor in your
base class (Dummy in your example). Because you have not written
destructors for either class, the compiler will conveniently give you one
for free.

Unfortunately, my version of StormC does not produce the expected result (a
possible bug?), but the GNU C++ compiler works fine!

Pit-falls like this, and many others are well documented in Scott Meyers'
Effective C++ (2nd Edition) and More Effective C++ books. They're worth
every penny (as the expression goes :).

Hi guys,

Could one of you BOOPSI experts help me out?

I'm writing a system hack allowing windows to be scrolled with wheelmice: 
When my input handler receives a wheelmouse event, my main task hunts for
prop gadgets and forges IDCMP_GADGETUP intuimessages from them.  This
works beautifully with original and gadtools gadgets (and the scrollers in
workbench windows), and for windows which don't have recognisable
scrollers, I'm forging cursor key movements.  The only problem is with
programs which ignore key presses, but have scrollers created with
BOOPSI, BGUI or ClassAct.

My question is this:  When trawling through the gadget list of someone
else's window, is there any safe way of recognising a gadget created by
propgclass?

All the best,

OK, thanks for clarifying this! I did first try to add a virtual destructor,
but it failed -- though after reading your reply I reported it as a bug of
StormC (while playing with overloading new & delete for classes I found two
other bugs, so it seems that this part of StormC is quite broken :-( )

Hello,

Hello,

I've never worked with a palette gadget in gadtools, but I do know that
when I have programmed for the gadtools library, I had to be sure to only look
for the mouseup which is the mouse button being released.

The other thing that I had to do is set up a loop so that I only acted on the
last IDCMP event that was passed to my program.  

But, as with your problem, before I made those changes, I would click a button,
release the mouse button, and the button would activate again or deactivate,
depending on how the button was set up.

Hope that helps a little bit.

Clicking a stringgadget will always make it active. The same goes for
textfields (like TextEditor.mcc) -- I think NList has some weird thing about
going active or becoming 'default' when clicked, but you aren't using this,
right?

Subject: @{b}Windows@{ub}

The following code works fine, printing 'word' across the window, but if i skip the window.Activate() (wich calls ActivateWindow();), i will receive no printing and the program eventually locks up, but the latter only occasionaly. I've come to the conclusion that the error occurs because the window is not physicly open, when i try to print to it, or receive messages (using WaitClose). Eventually, the activation of the window causes either a pause that allows intuition to 'really' open the window, or the call itself forces intuition to finish opening ?

So OpenWindow() does not ensure the window is actually open,  yes ?
And if yes, is calling ActivateWindow() (or specifying WA_Activate in taglist); the 'right' way to solve the problem ?

Thank you.


void main()
    {
    int    x;

    // OpenWindowTagList() is used to create a window for 'window'
    WinX    window("Test_Window",0,0,640,512);

    // This Creates an IntuiText derived object
    IWord    a_word("word"); 
    
    // Prog doesn't work if this line is skipped

    // Print the text across the screen
    // Uses PrintIText();

I think it is a simpler problem that this - I get events from the gadget fine,
it's just that it does not  permanently show the currently selected entry (ie
the little 'paint pot' does not stay depressed).
That's why I think it's something as simple as a flag. Though you have given
me a clue - it could well be my IDCMP messages - I only ask for 
IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW | IDCMP_GADGETUP

Any one any ideas?

Are you using GetIMsg() to retrieve the messages?  GadTools gadgets
generate a lot of IDCMP events that you don't care about and are handled
by the gadget.  When you call GetIMsg() you get the "distilled" version of
things.  

Also, I don't have the information right in front of me, but somewhere in
the include files are defines for which types of IDCMP messages you should
ask for when you set up the window.  So, instead of specifically asking
for IDCMP_GADGETUP, you'd ask for the IDCMP message for the palette
gadget.  If you need more clarification on this, just write and I'll dig
up the info.  

BTW, if you want an example of using GadTools gadgets, I wrote a skeleton
C application for a contest some time ago.  You might still be able to
find it on Aminet as Skeleton_C.lha, or from my (woefully outdated)
website at http://www.en.com/users/gregr.   I don't think I have a palette
gadget in there, but I do use a number of different ones so you should be
able to get the general idea.

Good luck!

I'm not sure exactly what you need it for, but I have a method to check if a
copy of my program is already running by using the "FindTask()" function.

This is only good if you just want to find out if the task is running.  I'm not
sure how to find out how many copies are running, but if that's what you need,
then I'm sure someone else can explain it to both of us.

Excerpt from page 85 of "Mapping the Amiga"

FindTask

Library:	exec.library

I've already considered FindTask(), but it's not what I'm looking for.
The main reason being - tasks names are not unique. A call to
FindTask() only returns the first matching task pointer with that
name.

I'm writing a resource tracker (it's a personal debugging tool, much
like SnoopDOS, but tracks resources through their allocated
life-time) and I want to be able to store a task pointer, then check
later to see if that same task is still running. Because task names
are not unique, FindTask() isn't the best solution. Task pointers are
the ideal solution. An exec function called IsTaskPtrValid() would
have kept me happy. :-)

The only way I can think of doing this, is to peek into execbase's
task lists. This method isn't really system friendly since the exec
lists are marked private.

You'll have to traverse Exec's task list as quickly as possible
between a Forbid/Permit pair. I have a function I wrote in
assembly to do this, it is my implementation of IsTaskPtrValid().
I've been using it for years with no problems so I know that
it's stable. I'll be happy to assemble the function as an object
and provide you with a SAS/C calling prototype.

You can't avoid this, you have to peek Exec's lists. Although
they're marked private, *lots* of software does this. Provided
you disable multi-tasking during list traversal (some people
even use a Disable/Enable to be extra safe, but that's not
really necessary) you're taking all the precautions you
possibly can. This is one of those few cases where you need

Im using generic Listview object from MUI.

This is MyClass:

  obj = (Object*)DoSuperNew(cl, obj,
    MUIA_Group_Horiz, FALSE,
      Child, VGroup,
        Child, HGroup,
          Child, popVolume = PopobjectObject,
            ...
            MUIA_Popobject_Object, lstPopVolume = ListviewObject,
              ...
              End, /* ListviewObject */
            End, /*PopobjectObject */
          End, /* HGroup */
      Child, lstDirList = ListviewObject,
        MUIA_CycleChain, 1,
        MUIA_Listview_MultiSelect, MUIV_Listview_MultiSelect_Default,
        MUIA_Listview_List, DirlistObject,
          ...
          End, /* DirListObject */
        End, /* ListviewObject */
       
    TAG_MORE, msg->ops_AttrList);

This is MainWnd:

  obj = (Object*)DoSuperNew(cl, obj,
    ...
    WindowContents, VGroup,
      Child, HGroup,
        Child, PanelL = NewObject(CCPanel->mcc_Class, NULL, TAG_DONE),
        Child, BalanceObject, End,
        Child, PanelR = NewObject(CCPanel->mcc_Class, NULL, TAG_DONE),
      End, /* HGroup */
      Child, ColGroup(2),
        Child, Label("CLI Command:"),
        Child, strCommand = String("", 100),
        End, /* ColGroup */
      Child, HGroup,
        MUIA_Group_Spacing, 0,
        Child, btn1 = SimpleButton("Help"),
        Child, btn2 = SimpleButton("F2"),
        ...
      End, /* HGroup */
    End, /* VGroup */
  TAG_MORE, msg->ops_AttrList);

I need to perform some action when btn1 or btn2 is pressed. Data for
the action is taken from active list view. But what to do when user
click string object or popobject and then the button?

One final thing I forgot to mention, IsTaskPtrValid() is not
by itself suitable for checking if a task which was known to be
running at some time in the past is still running now, because
it does not account for the possibility that a task was removed
and a subsequent task was added at the same memory location.

To solve this, you also need to account for the task name. To
get a valid match, you need to match both the task name string
(or hash key if you prefer) *and* the task address.

Where's the task ID stored? I can't see it in the Task structure.

I know what you mean, I considered this myself. If a task is freed
then another one is created right after it, they *might* just share
the same task pointer.

I'm already doing this, of course this wouldn't work 100% if a task
decided to modify it's ln_Name field. But it's probably the best
solution I have atm, even if it's a little hacky.

In your other post, you mentioned that Carl Sassenrath released some
example code, is this code on the Developer CD, do you know?

Thanks for your help.

Hi!

There is a good example of how to program the gadtools palette on
Aminet.  I tried it, and the paint buttons stay down when clicked. 
Search for GadgetTest.lha.

Be careful using this book, it's littered with errors (eg: Move(),

OpenWindow() and OpenWindowTagList() DO open the window on return.  There are options which can make the window active or inactive when it opens, but you should be able to print intuitext to it immediately.  It might be a bug in your window class.

It is a bit of hack but that's unavoidable really since I'm
pretty sure Exec doesn't support task identification (someone
else said that it did, I could be wrong).

Even with checking both the name and address there is still the
remote possibility that you'll get an incorrect detection. A
full solution would probably involve patching AddTask() and
RemTask() to build your own task identification list (you'd
have to check that DOS functions like CreateProc() and
CreateNewProc() were being intercepted too, it's possible
they might not call the public Exec interface in all ROM
versions). Doing all this is almost certainly overkill
however, the chances of a bad detection using your current
solution would be extremely remote.

This is going back a long time so I'm not certain where I
saw this, however it may have been in his Guru's Guide book.
I no longer have a copy but I think the code is on Aminet.
The source to any "who" or "ps" type program will also be
good examples. If you can understand asm the source to Xoper
may be worth a look too.

Thanks, Bob, and to all else who replied. What I needed was indeed the
GTPA_IndicatorWidth tag. Oddly, though, it doesn't matter whether I set it to
1 or 100, it still does the same thing visually. This doesn't matter, but I
am sort of wondering what on Earth the point of this tag is...

It might help if you showed the class instead of the code, because this looks
like c++, and if you've defined your class right, then there shouldn't be a
problem with your code.

That's funny, I've never had any problems with those functions when I used them
from that book.  The only one that I haven't used that you listed is Signal().

But I do always use more than one reference, because I've seen too many of them
that have problems.

Well I see you need the asm includes. Since they are more upto date.

;* Pointer to an extended task structure.  This structure is allocated
;* by V36 Exec if the proper flags in tc_ETaskFlags are set.  This
;* field was formerly defined as:
;*  UWORD TC_TRAPALLOC     ; traps allocated
;*  UWORD TC_TRAPABLE     ; traps enabled
;* Please see the Exec AllocTrap() and FreeTrap() calls.
;*

;Don't even _think_ about allocating one of these yourself.
 STRUCTURE ETask,MN_SIZE
  APTR et_Parent  ;Pointer to task (TC)
  ULONG et_UniqueID  ;ID unique to this task
  STRUCT et_Children,MLH_SIZE ;List of children
  UWORD et_TRAPALLOC
  UWORD et_TRAPABLE
  ULONG et_Result1  ;First result
  APTR et_Result2  ;Result data pointer (AllocVec)
  STRUCT et_TaskMsgPort,MP_SIZE
  LABEL ETask_SIZEOF ;_never_ depend on this size!

But I now see it depends on a flag.

I forgot to call the function that resets the IntuiText structure, when creating an IWord from a char* !!!
The funny thing is the program didn't work, until i inserted the Activate, and when i removed the line, it stoped working. It was merely a strange coincident.

Compare the input registers for those functions with the ones listed
in the AutoDocs. If you're programming in C your prototypes/pragmas
will hide these errors, but if you do any assembly work the many
instances of incorrect registers will cause problems (if you're
lucky you'll get an immediate crash, otherwise the bug will lurk

Subject: @{b}List Newbie + VBCC/BOOPSI questions@{ub}

From: "Sealey, M." <mws2@leicester.ac.uk>

Hello! I'm new here, and I'd like to get
my first mail off to a flying start by asking
some REALLY nasty questions:

Are there any special considerations I need
to make to create BOOPSI classes in VBCC?

I'm currently writing some, but none of them
will work in class form due to some nasty
gurus in 'ramlib' (it's not a stack problem
in ramlib :) or in the task using the classes
itself.

I'm using a modified CLib37x to compile it
all, and as far as I can tell the code is
absolutely fine (I only get one warning, and
it's a harmless :) but I must be doing something
wrong somewhere.

So before I start throwing code around, I'm
just wondering if there are any special options
I need to specify to VBCC to make BOOPSI classes,
or compiler specific defines, etc..

(if you really want to know, I'm re-doing the
Reaction glyph.image to create a more pleasing
XEN-style look and add support for VisualPrefs'
through an internal API.. eventually ;)

Any help would be appreciated!

In some contexts they are very likely to share the same address. E.g. if a
program periodically launches a sub-process to handle some calculations then
it's likely to get the same address if the rest of the system is 'resting'.

I recently had to reinstall my entire system after a hdcrash.
At first everything (well, almost) worked fine but all of a sudden
'assign' wasnt working properly anymore. If I tried to make an
'assign xxx: dismount' nothing would happen; if I tried to make an
'assign mui:libs/ add' the specified directory would not be added to
the libs: assign, but instead would the 'LIBS:' assign be renamed to
'.IBS:'. Wierdest thing. 
After a while I noticed that if I used c:assign instead of just
'assign' everything worked, and I then took away the 'resident assign
pure' from the startup-sequence. Now it all works.

Now to my question. Did all this happen because assign is not really a
pure program, or what else could it be?
If a program is not pure, will it still work as a resident program if
its only run once at a time, or does that not matter?

and why did it work before?

I'll probably just write a patch for AddTask()/RemTask() that'll
ensure no two tasks will ever share the same task pointer, while my
program is running. :-)

This only works if the process has a CLI structure (i.e. not started
from WB), even then, a Shell Process can have many segment lists
attached to it during it's life time (not at the same time though).
Plus the fact that some programs like to dettach themselves from CLI
by spawning a new process with the existing segment list and clearing
their cli_Module field before exiting the old process.

So the segment list wouldn't be a solid form of task identification.
:-/

Thanks for your suggestion anyway.

It sounds like Assign is not re-entrant.

>If a program is not pure, will it still work as a resident program if
>its only run once at a time, or does that not matter?

It does matter, since variables won't be reset to the usual load
defaults when made resident. That would explain why C:Assign works
fine (it's loaded from disk/cache each time) but resident Assign
without the "P" attribute does not.

>and why did it work before?

Sounds like you lost the "P" attribute during the re-install.

Check that C:Assign has the "P" attribute set. It should be set.
Use "Protect C:Assign +P" to set it.  If Assign's flags are
incorrect you might want to assume that other commands are
also incorrect. When copying, you generally want to clone
the file exactly, however many copy programs don't do this
by default and some don't allow it all.

I believe assign is a pure program. I use resident and it works.

I think it will at least run once, then some data may have changed in memory
and some programs will not work twice. If they do work twice they may also
work more times. It will probably fail to run several times in parallel.

> and why did it work before?

Why didn't it work now is my question... Try to copy assign from the
workbench disks to make sure that it hasn't been trashed.

No,  the  opposite  is true.  The P attribute indicates that the program is
re-entrant AND re-executable, a category the standard Assign program almost
certainly  finds itself in.  Are you sure you're using the standard program

Not to my knowledge, but then I have only recently started to write custom classes, so I can't offer any great big shiny pearls of wisdom. :)

A couple of pit-falls to watch out for are:

1) Calls to printf() or puts() (debugging) in any dispatcher code.
2) Forgetting to use HookEntry() or register arguments for the dispatcher.

Hello,

Please excuse me if this is not a subject for this list.  I

I have a program written with ClassAct.  When I run it on OS 3.5
the colors are not correct.  Every line drawn on the screen is
black.  White isn't used at all.  It display fine under 3.1 and
I know it ran with 3.5 at one point because I posted a question
here about it losing memory when ran with 3.5.  The other 
programs I have that use ClassAct are the ClassAct demo, Thor
and Aweb and they all appear fine.  So...I must be doing 
something in my program to cause the colors to be incorrect.
I am using SA_FullPallete and SA_Colors but I tried removing them
and it didn't change anything.  I have installed a few utilities
but nothing that should affect this I don't think.  And even if 
they did, then the other programs should fail too.  This brings 
it back to something I am doing wrong in the program.  Any ideas?

The program just loads a picture through the datatype system and

You're seeing the effect, not the cause.

I bet you have some bad code somewhere & it's clobbering 
random memory.

I had something just like this happen to me with one of my programs.

Run Segtracker & Enforcer  (or cyber-thingy) from your Startup-sequence,
(just after setpatch)  & watch the fireworks......

Your system is probably partially already crippled before WB loads.

Sorry, my reply could have given that impression. The P attribute

I think Colin's advice to run Enforcer early during bootup should
track down the problem. The standard Assign is pure and shouldn't
behave the way you describe. It's strange that this happens
consistently however, it doesn't sound like a completely random
effect.  Let us know if you track down the problem, I for one
would be interested to know how this happened.

I realise I can't do that. My main problem is in the library
init: I thought I solved a ramlib crash by fixing a tiny
typo in my code and then I started getting application
crashes - then when I fixed the application crashes (I
assigned SysBase to a NULL pointer.. oops ;) then I  got
the ramlib crash back.

Basically it's accessing memory from a NULL pointer somewhere,
and backing up $12e bytes before reading data out. Quite what
that value $12e means I don't know, all I do know is that the
address is gets back is that many bytes below the 4Gb boundary ;)

Oh. I've done all that. The dispatcher is fine, it's the
library init. I'm converting code from SAS/C into something
I can compile in VBCC, and every time I compile it, it bombs
out.

Hiya,

Doing the basic GUI etc works fine.

   However I'm having trouble doing hooks for things like a custom popup

   As a starter for 10 I tried to compile the demo 'popup.c' but I get
'Initialiser has invalid type' errors for the declarations of the Hook

   Has any one any example source that compiles with HSC++ on this?

   Any help appreciated, thanks.

Not to my knowledge, but then I have only recently started to write custom classes, so I can't offer any great big shiny pearls of wisdom. :)

A couple of pit-falls to watch out for are:

1) Calls to printf() or puts() (debugging) in any dispatcher code.
2) Forgetting to use HookEntry() or register arguments for the dispatcher.

C++ has stronger typechecking, so here a hook structure must be initialized as:
  struct Hook hook = { { NULL, NULL }, (ULONG(*)())func, NULL, (APTR)udata };

You can also use the HOOKFUNC typedef from utility/hook.h, i.e.
  struct Hook hook = { { NULL, NULL }, (HOOKFUNC)func, NULL, (APTR)udata };

You can ommit the two last members, if you don't use the h_Data field.

From: Alexander Niven-Jenkins <anj@cremlinsoftware.org>

Hiya,

   This is probably specific to HiSOFT C++ (unfortuntely).

   My program runs either from CLI or WB, if run from the CLI it goes the
ReadArgs() way and if run from WB it opens the GUI.

   The problem is that if run from WB, I can't get it to output any startup
errors to the console (libraries failing to open etc).
   Once the GUI is up errors are displayed by a requester, so this isn't a
problem, it's solely errors which occur before the GUI is available.

   I've tried the simple route as in 'cout << blah' and every combination of
printf etc but to no joy, a console window doesn't open.

   Does anybody have any idea how to solve this?

   Unfortunately the wbstartup.h code only has german comments so it might
tell me in there but not knowing german I don't know (below is the bit) :-)

  #ifdef WBWINNAME
    // Ausgabe in Window umleiten:
    if(!freopen(WBWINNAME, "r+", stdout))

I'm considering the possiblity of creating a new API for joysticks, since we

the hardware.

Before I devote much time to this, does anyone know if anyone else is
already working on something along these lines?

Remember, you have two entry points with Hisoft C++. main() is called
when your program is started from Shell and wbmain() for Workbench.
This small example will allow you to print your debugging information
when started from Workbench (that is, if I haven't made any typos :-).

#include <exec/types.h>
#include <dos.h>

int main( void )
{
  BPTR FH;

  FH = Open("CON:0/11/640/120/Debug_window/CLOSE/WAIT", MODE_WRITE);

  if (FH)
  {
    VFPrintf(FH, "Hello!\n"); 

    Close(FH);
  } 
  return 0;
}

int wbmain( void )

  return main();
}

Hi there,

Anybody experimented with fast ways to write text to the screen? I've created
my own set of text functions to do anti-alised text, but I'd love to see them
become faster, which is why I ask here for inspiration.
Currently I create each bitplane in an off-screen buffer (using the cpu) and
then I move these to the screen with BltTemplate().  The first procedure is
simply a (bit-wise) copy since I have each glyph separated in planes (each
plane being a colour, that way I can easily change the colour range used)

With this approach I can write ~3300 characters pr. second (16 levels of grey,
14 pixels tall font (Arial), 040 @ 40MHz + PicassoIV) if I settle with 9
levels of grey than I can output twice as many characters, but there still is
a long way to go before the appearance of an entire page won't be crawling...

SetWriteMask() optimizations should be worthwhile for native chipset
displays.

I don't understand this part, since 9 and 14 grey levels imply the
same number of bitplanes so there should be no speed difference with
pre-calculated bitplanes. Are you doing realtime anti-aliasing?

> but there still is

If your primary target audience is gfx board users you might want to
experiment with chunky rendering. It's a bit fruitless trying to guage
the effectiveness of bitplane optimizations with RTG patches installed
so don't forget to test native performance too.

Yes, for each glyph. The bitplane I create is for a complete string of text.
Which seemed to be faster to put together with the cpu than to blit every
character to the screen.

I'm mainly targeting my efforts towards graphics cards.

A bitplane refers only to a single colour, since they're used with
BltTemplate() -- so 16 levels of grey requires 16 'bitplanes' -- if I were to
pack together the planes then I wouldn't be able to change the pen values used
for the colour range, without actually remapping the bitplanes. And since the
text is printed on many different coloured backgrounds, that wouldn't be
feasible.

Btw: I did a few optimizations and compiled it with some better options.
So I can now do ~7800 letters pr. second. I estimate that I'd need to
do atleast 50.000 l/s before page-scroll isn't a pain... :-(

I didn't look into assembling the entire bitmap in fast-ram, since I figured
that'd give me problems writting in JAM1-mode, but as I do know the background
(in most cases) then that's something I'll try :-)

But how do you recommend that I move my pixels to the gfx. card? Using
WritePixelArray8() will ensure AGA compatibility, but how fast is this on high
colour screens? Sometimes I get a feeling that if I were to output my gfx. in
the pixel-format used by the screen, I'd get a speedup. But since this
requires converting code on my part then I don't see why that should be any
faster than what's already in WritePixelArray() -- and I don't really want to
support 15+ different formats...

I just recalled that the other problem were that on high colour screens I only
allocate one exclusive pen, and change the colour of this after each blit, as
a 'fancy' document would otherwise drain the system for pens and/or give 
inexact results -- but for this family of screens I could probably calculate a
24 bit buffer and use an RTG function to write it out to the gfx. card...

Sorry I'm replying to your message, Allan, I missed the original one.

The most basic thing that will work is:

int main(void)
{
	printf("Content-type: text/plain\r\n");
	printf("Some-More-HTTP-Headers: blah-blah\r\n");
	printf("\r\n"); /* I have no more headers */
	printf("What you actually want to send here\n");

	exit(0); /* Or something else if something went wrong */

And please add a date-header if your contents isn't too dynamic, as that'll
allow browsers to use the cached version rather than re-fetching it... the
various headers are described in RFC 2068 (HTTP\1.1)

If you need a practical example, here's some C source to a CGI script
which accepts parameters for generating tiling procedural textures.
It returns a HTML page to load and tile the JPEG format texture.

I see. I haven't used BltTemplate() before but it strikes me as
being a high overhead solution for this particular problem. Another
way to approach the problem might be to pre-calculate a font for each
color required (I imagine each font consists of a base color and the
anti-aliasing colors?) Depending upon your requirements, this might
be feasible memory wise. You can then blit directly in planar format.

I think pre-calculation for each base color is the only way to achieve
this using a planar design, that or investigating a chunky approach.

If you can build everything off-screen (including the background)
you can manage the logic operations yourself in your own optimized
manner. Then a simple copy to the destination (or dirty rectangles
for partial updates) will be sufficient.

>But how do you recommend that I move my pixels to the gfx. card? Using

Well, that's really the deciding factor, do you need native support?
If not, you could investigate using the RTG API functions directly
which are likely to be more optimized.

WritePixelArray8() is basically a chunky to planar converter so
I would expect this to be "reasonably fast" for RTG screens since
converting between different chunky formats is no where near as
complex as converting to planar format quickly. Experimentation
is obviously required, you might be pleasantly surprised (for
native displays, don't expect too much though :-)

Yes, that is a hassle. You should also check Aminet for other options,
you might find something already implemented which will make life
easier for you.

Right, as I understand it, this is slightly hacky code which redefines
stdin and stdout to a user-defined filename.  You need to do something like
this:

#define WBWINNAME "con:0/0/640/100/auto/close"

then #include the wbstartup code.  Since this file actually contributes
code rather than just definitions (when WBWINNAME is defined), it'll probably
have to be #included in main().  Then again, I'm thinking C, not C++ so I might
be wrong about this.

int main()
{
  #include <wbstartup.h>

}

This will redefine stdin/out even if started from the shell; if HiSoft c++
provides an alternate wbmain() entry, put the include file there instead. 
If not, depending on what else is in wbstartup.h, you might get away with
putting the include in a conditional, i.e

  if(WBenchMsg)  // or whatever it's called under HiSOFT c++
  {
    #include <wbstartup.h>
  }

All the best,

I sent my money off to this guy 3 or 4 months ago at least. He said he was
going to send it out after I emailed a couple times, but have yet to see it.
Ended up ordering the PSXport from Blitersoft, and received it yesterday, and
seems to work quite well with Clickboom Quake, though I'm having problems
with ADoom. Also, stay away from the Mad Catz controller item code 8026. I
got this as I like the complete circle design diractional pads and the Sony
controllers have it split into 4 buttons which are torture onmy thumb. Went
out and got one of them today though, and it works fine. The Mad Catz one
doesn't want to work at all, though the designer, Joe Fenton, says he uses a
Mad Catz pad with no problems. It should see support in a Quake port and
Shogo from what I hear, and Joe said that ADoom PPC 1.4 uses it. And I
actually got it, which was nice. I wouldn't recommend the APPE at this point,
as I think I got ripped off. He had months head start on Blittersoft's
shipment, but the PSXport crossed the pond and went through customs already,
I don't see any reason to think the APPE I ordered will arrive anytime soon,
if ever. The PSXport disk does have developer stuff on it, so should suit
you.

   If this is via the PSX then look at most PSX source sites there's loads,
even code for G-Con45 comptible guns.  If it's via a PC/Amiga, I don't
know, infact I don't even know the pin outs, I suspect someone like the
Bleem author would be best here.

I'd be interested to have a look at it.

I use some code to handle an ASCII configfile. It's available as part of the
ML-Support source on Aminet. I also have an improved version with better

   Thanks alot, this is exactly what I needed to know, due to the way HiSOFt

Hello experts :),

upto now I only used Blitzbasic and arexx for programming purposes. So
memory allocation is something I didn't have to use. And that's my first
question: Is it absolutely necessary to use memory allocation, for example
if I want to make a database. I see the advantage that I can allocate the
memory dynamically, but what other advantages are there? Wouldn't it be
enough the do a structure of a database an array/pointers of it?

And, how do I have to do the memory allocation? I mean, If I have an array,
getting the different fields is clear, but if I allocate memory each time
new data is entered, I also have to have a name for the allocated
memory-part. But how can I have a different name each time and also can do
it with a general function? Wouldn't I have to have some kind of array
again?

Sorry, if these are some silly questions, but  I am completely lost at the
moment... :-/

You need to do it dynamically. Otherwise you would be stuck with a fixed
size of the database. The database would always take up memory for the whole
size, even if there's only one entry. And when the database is full you
wouldn't be able to add another record without recompiling the program.

Each time you add a record you allocate memory for the size of one record.
You'll get a new memory area each time you do that, at least until the
memory ist full... Of course you need to track where your records are in
memory, to be able to access and free them on exit of your program.

until the program was about to finish when a 0x0100000F recoverable alert
popped up which indicates a bad FreeMem call however the call that causes
the alert does not use freemem at all and I can't figure out whats wrong. I
used Dice to compile the example and the fdtolib tool that comes with dice
to generate the autoinit stuff and the DMakeFile which I used came from the

Dont be using arrays anyway,  Use Amiga List  structures, It is then easier
to keep track of

Your best bet is to use a linked list. Check out the docs for NewList()
AddHead() RemHead() Remove() Enqueue() etc. and use a structure like this:

struct record
{
 struct Node mynode;
 char somedata[100];
 int moredata;

 ...

}; 
which can be cast as a struct Node * and given to the above functions.

Or use a structure like this:

struct record
{
 struct record *next;
 struct record *prev;
 char somedata[100];

 ...
}recordList;


and do the linking yourself. eg:

struct record *allocRecord()
{
struct record *recordPtr;

 recordPtr=AllocVec(sizeof(struct record),MEMF_ANY);

 {
 struct record *tempRecPtr;

  tempRecPtr=recordList.next;

  recordPtr->prev=&recordList;

  recordList.next=recordPtr;

  recordPtr->next=tempRecPtr;
 }

return recordPtr;
 
}

NOTE: This code is awful. It should have error checking and it assumes that
you have initialised recordList to zero.

You can then walk the list with this.

recordPtr=&recordList.next;
while(recordPtr)
        {
         do stuff...


         recordPtr=recordPtr->next;
        }



BTW pointers are the quickest way to crash you machine. Use with care. It
wouldn`t suprise me if someone points out a grievous error in this code as I
havn`t double checked it and it`s very easy to make mistakes.

Yeah, but I think I will need some kind of "identifier" for each piece of
memory.But Tim Hanson has kindly written some code-lines, will have a
deeper look on that and see if it solves the problem...

Arrays are fine for storing data records, but you'll eventually find
yourself running out of entries because array are always fixed in
length. You could get around this by defining a very large array, but
you'll end up eating lots of memory.

Say for example your database program needs to store 5000 records,
what you could do is define an array with 5000 pointers. Each pointer
in this array will point to your record structure, which you can
dynamically allocate with malloc() or the Amiga's
AllocMem()/AllocVec() functions. An unused record slot in this array
could be represented with a NULL. So when you add a record to your
database, you'll have a loop which scans the whole array until it
encounters a NULL, if it doesn't you'll know you're out of record
slots. If it does, you can allocate your record structure, fill it
in, and place the pointer to that record in your array, where you
found the NULL. Of course, don't forget to free your records before
your program quits.

This is a very simply way of handling a database of records, but is
limited to 5000 record slots.

Another solution would would be to use linked lists, but linked lists
take more work to setup and are difficult to manage, especially if
you're just getting to grips with C.

Basically with a linked list (Amiga style), you have a list header and
a chain of "nodes". Each node in the chain contains a node structure
and your record structure. The node structure contains information
about the node itself plus information on where the next (and
previous) node is located in memory.

exec.library provides functions for manipulating linked lists, but
you're better of learning how memory allocation works before you
embark on using them.

Hello Stephan,

You've already received a few replies to this message, but I had started coding already. So I thought what the hell, a few more examples and ideas wouldn't hurt. :)

BTW, all the examples were written in portable ANSI-C (I was away from home at the time).

> And, how do I have to do the memory allocation?
The files example1.c and example2.c show you how with descriptive comments.

> Wouldn't I have to have some kind of array again?
The files main.c, database.c and database.h demonstrate a *very* simple database using an array of pointers. The front-end to the program is a bit grotty, but it was only ment to be a quick example. The array of pointers is automatically resized when required. One advantage of implementing a database like this is fast sort times you can achieve, because only pointers are moved, not database records.

Just an idea for you (I don't know if it's any good);

An array of pointers does not consume very much memory. It would therefore be possible to have several arrays. Each one for referencing the database sorted on different keys.

Finally, I appologise for any errors (design and implementation) in the source!

Kind Regards
Nathan

Wow, a lot of effort clearly went into that. Nice job! :-)

The only comment I'd like to add (which I'm sure you know, I'm
pointing this out for the benefit of Stephan) is that on the Amiga
you should really stick with standard Exec lists and nodes rather
than use custom lists or arrays. You often need to display lists
in listview gadgets, but this requires standard Exec lists
(of course, you can write a converter for this if required,
but then things start to get messy).

I've not used PhotoShop myself, but I seem to remember reading (and it has
been known for my memory to play tricks on me!) that Adobe hold a patent
on one of PhotoShop's dither methods.  The term 'pattern dither' rings a
bell, so it could well have been this one.

Is this query just out of interest, or do you need a dither method

Cool, another interesting method. But I think the linked-lists method is the
best one.

Let's see. Even if I don't use it, it's good to see how things can be done.

But even if it is only a small amount of memory it shouldn't be necessary,
so I think I'll try the linked-list method.

And I would have to define an array again. And so I would loose the

needed.

I'm trying out small things in ansi-c for quite a while now, so I think I

Seems like the gadgets-structure (or was it the requester-structure?) with
references to the next and previous gadgets. I remember reading about it in
the RKM.

This is what I had in mind when writing the mail. I didn't mention it
because I was in a hurry and didn't want to write too much confusing stuff
in the first reply...

I've got some code to offer which handles ASCII config files using exec
lists. Should be enough as an lists example, although the latest version is
currently unreleased.
It's available as part of the ML-Support source on Aminet, look at Config.c
and Config.h.

Arrays can be dynamically allocated and resized as needed without losing
data.    And the entries can be accessed much faster than with lists,
barring
the use of hash tables and the like.

Think about sorting and searching. These could become you're two biggest performance killers. Perhaps these suggestions might help you;

1) When sorting your list, move the pointers instead of the actual nodes.

2) Use a doubly-linked list to traverse the database in either direction.

3) Insert items in to your list in sorted order. This will make it un-necessary to sort the list unless you need to change the sort critera.

4) Implement a binary search to find entries in your sorted list - instead of iterating from head to tail to find an item.

5) Oh yeah, have fun!

It's not necessary! It was just an idea to improve the sorting speed of your database. Especially if you are going to do sorts on different fields often.

What happens internally is that each name you declare hooks up with
a variable address. Your pointer variables will point to the data you
want to store.

If you want to set up a linked list then the linked list structure
will contain the data variables AND a pointer to the same type of
linked list structure.

This way you can chain your data together into a continuous 'list'.
You can step through the list one item at a time to look for the
data that you want.

As far as pointer variables are concerned, you only need to worry
about the address of the first item in the list and the address of
the 'current' item in the list. So at a minimum you really only
need two pointer variables. You might need 3 (or maybe 4) depending
upon what you do with the list but these will probably just be
temporary.

If you're writing a database program, I really would suggest really
learning pointer/memory stuff. Eventually you're going to want to
store that data in some other structure (maybe a tree?) (or worse,
you might need to reference the same data from a variety of
different structures)

Good luck! I hope some of this made sense!

You can if you like... I would store the data in a structure
similar to the Exec lists. You'll probably want to make the
structure a two-way linked list. (You might even want to create
a b-tree).


I would leave the list alone during sorts and searches and instead
I would create a copy of the list which contained only the elements
which I was searching for.

Good advice! Having your list pre-sorted into some kind of
order is usually very important.

For example DB of telephone numbers: pre-sort by surname.
You can extract names easily (or at least find roughly the
right place :)


If you need to sort by area-code (or something) then one
way to do it is to step through your original doubly-linked
list, adding things a secondary dl-list in area order...

Once you are finished manipulating the new list then zap all
of the pointers - but make sure that your original list and the
data are all intact/valid!

If you're looking for just one entry then you can do this. It's
easy and you'll probably already know the algorithm ;)

If you're looking for more than one entry then you can use this
method to find one data item that fits your query. You have to
expand on the algorithm in some way to get more than one hit.

If you find that you need to do that kind of thing you should
maybe consider using an existing db that you can interact
with from within your program. (Using SQL or something?)
It might save you as lot of coding time. (but I don't know
how good SQL dbs and stuff are on the Amiga)


> 5) Oh yeah, have fun!

Anyone who gets into serious pointer stuff always has fun.
You know the old saying "Time flies when you're having fun"
It takes a long time to track down bugs ;)

Hiya,

I have a window with a gadget in that brings up as ASL requester when you click on it.  I was wondering if the image used in Intellifont (where you click on it to choose the location of fonts), was considered a standard for this kind of thing.  I can't find any reference to it in the includes.  If not, then what is a good thing to use?  Maybe "..." like Windows?

I know some dither routines, even some patented ones, and I'm not using
APhotoshop, but pattern dither sounds like normal ordered dither for me ;)
[or it can be modified ordered dither]. Anyway, best result for 256 colors
are given by floyd&steinberg and similiar routines, if you need to know
how - contact me, I'm quite experienced in this area.

Subject: @{b}Bobs and GELS@{ub}

From: Lee Atkins <lee@loonyjuicesoftware.freeserve.co.uk>

Hello,
Imagine, if you will, a vertical wall on the right hand side of the screen. 
On the left is a Bob created and managed by the Gels system.  When the bob
is standing next to the wall after traveling from the right, the wall must
change.  I have done this by blitting the new gfx over the old wall image
(the screen is double buffered and all gfx operations go to the hidden
bitmap)
The problem is the bob overlaps the wall and when the bob moves, the OS
updates the bitmap from the buffer it stored previous to me blitting in new
gfx.  Is there a way of removing the Bob image, blitting the new stuff, then
moving the bob.
Also is the Gels system the best way to handle Bobs or is there a better
way.

Hope that made sense.

Lee.

Did the article mention their technique? I believe that if they have a patent
then they must have published the method in one way or another...

I'm author of ImageManager.library which currently offers random, ordered and
FS dither, but I'm always interested in new schemes if they're any good :-)

There is no standard support for this gadget type in Intuition,
so the standard is whatever you define it to be :-)  However,
that type of image is quite common; many of the GUI builders
include it or something like it for use. If you prefer to make
your own you can use BOOPSI or even low level Intuition gadgets
with the appropriate imagery rendered as you like.

I don't suppose it matters, as long as you're consistent.
You could use a capital "F" or even ">>" or something like that.
Maybe the Style Guide has something to say about this, but I
don't have a copy handy.
