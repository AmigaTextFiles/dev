This is the source of the native Amiga port (no ixemul.library required)
of ICU, IBM's International Classes For Unicode

To build on the Amiga using gcc, you must first of all install a wide
character library (e.g., the simple wchar library that I have extracted
from the Jikes source, available at both Aminet and the Amiga Jikes
site, http://dias.cti.gr/~kyrimis/jikes/ . After this, cd to icu/source,
set you stack to at least 30000, invoke configure from sh as follows:

CFLAGS="-O0 -fomit-frame-pointer -m68000 -msoft-float -DAPP_NO_THREADS" \
CXXFLAGS="-O0 -fomit-frame-pointer -m68000 -msoft-float -DAPP_NO_THREADS" \
LDFLAGS="-noixemul -s -m68000 -msoft-float" LIBS="-lw" configure \
--host=amiga --prefix=GG: --bindir=GG:bin --sbindir=GG:bin \
--libexecdir=GG:libexec --datadir=GG:share --sysconfdir=GG:etc \
--sharedstatedir=GG:com --localstatedir=GG:var --libdir=/GG/lib \
--includedir=GG:include --infodir=GG:info --mandir=GG:man

adjusting for the CPU, FPU, and optimization level of your preference, then
type "make". Be warned that raising the optimization level increases
compilation time significantly, and requires large amounts of memory.

This will build all of the package, except for one of the test programs
that requires pthreads. After the package is built, type "make install"
to install it.
