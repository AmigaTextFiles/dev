MorphOS notes:
--------------
[Andreas R. Kleinert <info@ar-kleinert.de]

68k libraries created using the CLib37x skeleton
will run under MorphOS' 68k emulation without any
problems (as far as the library code itself is concerned).

As soon as the MorphOS developer kit becomes public,
the sources may be modified to also allow for compiling
PPC native library replacements.

Watch out!
