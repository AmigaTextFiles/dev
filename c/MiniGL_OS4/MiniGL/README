MiniGL V1.5 preliminary documentation
--------------------------------

MiniGL is a 3D API which is compatible to OpenGL(tm). It implements a subset
of that API and was designed for speed, therefore it directly interfaces with
Warp3D. This also means that there is currently no software mode.

This release is the second release of MiniGL as a set of shared libraries.
There are two such libraries: minigl.library, which is the GL part,
and mglut.library, which implements some of the GLUT API.

The new shared library interface drops a lot of the original functions (mgl*)
in favor of GLUT. Unfortunately, no documentation exists yet. Refer to the 
glut source code and src/context.c to get an idea on how it works.

Changes in V1.5.1
-----------------
- Fixed some bugs found 
- Removed debug output that was slowing things down
- It is now possible to allocate only one buffer instead of being forced to do double buffering (thanks to Steen Lund)
- The gl**Pointer(GLint size, ...) functions can now be used with size set to 2. Previously only 3 and 4 were valid (thanks to Steen Lund)

Changes in V1.5
---------------
- MiniGL now supports display lists
- GL_NORMALIZE support added
- It is now possible to allocate only one buffer instead of being forced to do double buffering
- The gl**Pointer(GLint size, ...) functions can now be used with size set to 2. Previously only 3 and 4 were valid
- Added a watchdog timer to the smart locking mode (MGL_LOCK_SMART). Audio
  should now playback smoothly when running OpenGL applications
 NOTES:
    - Only works if "Interrupt=Yes" is set in the Radeon monitor tooltypes 
    - This has only been tested on a Radeon 9000 card
    - This cannot guarantee that audio stuttering won't occur. 
- Fixed a bug that would cause only the first quad in a quad-strip to render 
 (resulting in missing surfaces)
- Fixed flat shading of tri-strips and quad-strips

Installation
--------------
Simply copy the contents of the libs drawer into libs:. The demos and utilities can be
put wherever you like. Developers should copy the contents of the "developer files"
drawer into SDK:.
