Here are two little programs that show all 2^24 colors on an
AGA HAM8 screen without ever changing the 64 base color registers.

gtest was the first attempt (people should not run gtest unless they first
study the code to see how to exit :-).  gtest2 is the program that should
interest most users.  Full source code is included with both programs.

There is also an example use of the display database in gtest2.
Hopefully this example will stir commercial developers to support
the display database in their programs.

This code, except the ListRequest () routine, is PD.  Donated to
the public domain by the author, Loren J. Rittle <rittle@comm.mot.com>.
Have fun with it, but please don't claim this work as your own.  As it
is PD, please feel free to take any pieces to your own projects.

ListRequest() originally by Willy Langeveld, October 1991.
Changes for this project by myself.
Willy gave me permission to include this code with another
package.  As it is quite useful, I have included it here in
another form.  Thanks Willy!

Thanks to Chris Green (of Commodore) for:
LoadRGB32 (struct ViewPort *, unsigned long *table);
#pragma libcall GfxBase LoadRGB32 372 9802

Let's hope that more entry points are revealed on UseNet to tide us
over until the real includes are available...
For example, I'd like the pragma info on the system calls that allow
me to do double bufferred animation under the OS... :-)

Enjoy!
