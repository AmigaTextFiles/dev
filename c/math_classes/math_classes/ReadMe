Short: A Matrix and a Bignum class for C++

This is a couple of classes written in C++ that handles
Bignums (integers whose size is limited only by available memory)
and matrices.
The matrix directory contains several versions of the code, use whatever suits
you best. (There is even a C version includd that was my first attempt this)
The PMatrix class is a permutation matrix and the LUMatrix is a matrix that
has been LU-decomposed. (if you didn't understand the last sentence so don't worry,
you probably won't need them then :-) )
The documentation is sorely lacking but using the classes is fairly 
straight-forward. (The Bignum class is fairly well commented - in Swedish only. :-( )

This code is hereby placed into the public domain.
