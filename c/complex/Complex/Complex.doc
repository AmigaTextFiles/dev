		         Complex Numbers for C

				  by

			  Nicholas d'Alterio


This is small set of functions I put together when faced with having
to use complex numbers whilst programming in C. This may be duplicating
work done by others but here it is anyway.

Description

The functions perform the basics arithmetic operations for complex numbers
together with the standard Modulus and Arguments.

Sorry for the major over commenting but the lecturers love it!

Compilation

Just use the appropriate Makefile

Use

Complex numbers are dealt with as a structure (COMPLEX) with simply 
contains two fields, the real and imaginary parts. i.e.

	num.Real            real part
	num.Imag	    complex part

Then just use the appropriate functions

The Functions 

ComAdd	-	add 2 complex numbers
ComSub	-	subtract a complex number from another
ComMul  -	multiply 2 complex numbers
ComDiv  - 	divide one complex number by another
ComArg	-	the argument of a complex number
ComMod  -	modulus of a complex number

History

This will probably be the one and only release unless I have made any
major cockups

Use as you see fit - its totally free

Look out for matrix functions - coming soon
