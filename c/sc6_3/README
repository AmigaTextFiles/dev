This patch set may be freely redistributed.  Please upload it to
bulletin boards, make it available at user group meetings, and
use any other method that will make it available to registered
users of the SAS/C Development System, Version 6.

This patch procedure requires that you have the original seven-disk
set for the SAS/C Development System, Version 6.0.  The original
disks will not be modified.  After you install the patch, keep 
the original disks for use with future patches.

The changes for the 6.3 release are a superset of the changes for 
the 6.2 and 6.1 releases; all 6.1 and 6.2 fixes are included with 
6.3.  Therefore, the patch process will work correctly whether you 
have version 6.0, 6.1, or 6.2.

Double-click on the Install-6.3-Patch icon to install the patch.
You will be prompted immediately to insert the first disk from
the original disk set, SASC_6.0_DISK_1 .

You will be asked if you want to install the patch on a hard disk
or a floppy.  Choose the same method you chose when you installed
version 6.0 in the first place.

The hard disk install will read the original disks and install the
patched version in SC:.

The floppy install will patch the 2 or 3 disk set created by the 
floppy install of the SAS/C Development system.


The Version 6.0 installation process supports the ability to 
suppress the installation of certain parts of the product.
If you chose to suppress installation of some part of the product
when you installed 6.0, and you want to install that portion
of the product in the future, you must first use your original
6.0 disks to install that portion, then apply the 6.3 patch again
to make sure that portion is up to date.  For example, you might
have chosen to suppress installation of the assembler when you
installed 6.0.  If you have already applied the 6.3 patch and
you want to now add the assembler, you must first go back to your
original 6.0 disks, install the assembler, then reinstall the 
6.3 patch to bring the assembler up to date.
