This is a subset of the wide character library, which is used to build
the Jikes Java compiler and the ICU (International Classes for Unicode)
package, which Jikes requires.  The code is derived from the Jike source,
and is therefore governed by the IBM public license, which can be found
in jikes.html, under which the Jikes is distributed.

To install for use with gcc, copy wchar.h to GG:include and libw.a
to GG:lib.
