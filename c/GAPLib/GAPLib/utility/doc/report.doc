report/--background--                                     report/--background--

   PURPOSE
	To enable easy generation of data files for GAP-Lib.

   OVERVIEW
	Report generation utility code for GAP-Lib.

	The report utility package consists of three functions, one to
	initialize a report structure, one to write data to any report files
	and one to free resources allocated by the other two functions. The
	useage should be fairly obvious and the function and format
	descriptions will now follow after just one further ado.

   EXAMPLE
	This example outlines the useage of the report function, in this
	case two report files will be generated - "example.avg" and
	"example.max".

	Example code:

	#include <GAP.h>
	#include "report.h"

	int main(void)
	{
	struct Report *Rep;
	struct Population *Pop;
	...
	   Rep = MakeReport("example",NULL);
	   if(Rep!=NULL) {
	   ...
	      Pop = Evolve(Pop,Tags);
	      DoReport(Rep,Pop,AVERAGE|MAX);
	   ...
	      EndReport(Rep);
	   }
	...
	}

report/--format--                                             report/--format--

   OVERVIEW
	The data format output by DoReport() is indeed very simple. It consists
	of two columns of data in human-readable form. The first column is the
	generation and the second the data value itself. Furthermore, at the
	top of each file there is a one line comment describing the content of
	the columns.
	   The reason for choosing this format is one one hand that it is
	simple to work with, and on the other hand to be compatible with
	gnuplot.

   DESCRIPTION
	The data format is as follows (Well, actually the format for TypeCount
	is <Integer> <Integer>, but it does not hurt to treat it as double):

	#Generation, <Data>
	<Integer> <Double>
	...
	...
	<Integer> <Double>

   EXAMPLE
	Sample datafile:

	#Generation, Average
	1 28.23554
	2 29.45442
	3 31.13943
	4 31.64233
	5 31.88642
	6 33.19521
	7 35.16777
	8 35.74699
	9 36.77469
	10 37.45532

report/EndReport                                               report/EndReport

   NAME
	EndReport -- Free a report structure.

   SYNOPSIS
	void EndReport(struct Report *);

	EndReport(Rep);

   FUNCTION
	Frees all resources associated with a report structure and flushes
	output. In the case of using multipass mode, no output is written
	until this function is called.

   INPUTS
	Rep	- The report structure to be deallocated.

   RESULT
	None.

   BUGS
	None known.

   SEE ALSO
	MakeReport(), DoReport()

report/DoReport                                                 report/DoReport

   NAME
	DoReport -- Write report data from a population structure.

   SYNOPSIS
	void DoReport(struct Report *,struct Population *,unsigned long int);

	DoReport(Rep,Pop,Flags);

   FUNCTION
	Writes poulation data to a set of report files.

   INPUTS
	Rep	- The report structure in question.
	Pop	- The population to retrieve the data from.
	Flags	- A set of flags which determine which data to write.
		  Available flags are:

		   AVERAGE   - Average fitness.
		   MEDIAN    - Median fitness.
		   TYPECOUNT - Count of most common fitness value.
		   STDDEV    - Standard Deviation.
		   MAX       - Maximum fitness.
		   MIN       - Minimum fitness.
		   ALL       - All the above.

		  Flags are combined by OR:ing them together and e.g.
		  AVERAGE|MAX would mean write average and maximum fitness
		  to the report files.

   RESULT
	None.

   BUGS
	None known.

report/MakeReport                                             report/MakeReport

   NAME
	MakeReport -- Initialize a report structure and return it.
	MakeReportT -- Varargs interface to MakeReport.

   SYNOPSIS
	struct Report *MakeReport(char *,struct TagItem *);
	struct Report *MakeReportT(char *,...);

	Rep = MakeReport(Basename,TagList);
	Rep = MakeReport(Basename,...);

   FUNCTION
	This function will initialize a report structure and open
	report files for writing. Basename is the first part of the
	filenames used for the data. The actual filenames are formed by
	appending a suitable suffix to the basename such as ".max" for
	maximum fitness data.

   TAGS
	REP_Multipass - (BOOL) Enables or disabled multipass mode. In
	     multipass mode all values are stored in memory and the
	     average over all runs are written when EndReport() is
	     called. To envable multipass mode, one must also provide
	     REP_Generations. Multipass mode uses substantially more
	     memory than singlepass mode.

	REP_Generations - (int) Sets the number of generations in each
	     pass for multipass mode.

	REP_Indexed - (BOOL) Usually, old reports are overwritten when
	     running a program again. With this flag set to TRUE, every
	     report will have an index from 0 to MAX_INDEX as defined in
	     report.c (Currently 2048). The correct index is determined
	     at run time and is the highest free index. An index is
	     considered available if there is no file with the same
	     basename and index regardless of extension.

   INPUTS
	Basename   - The main part of the names of the report files.
	TagList    - Options to MakeReport().

   RESULT
	An initialized report structure or NULL if an error occured.

   BUGS
	None known.
