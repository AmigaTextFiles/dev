   PURPOSE
	The Genetic Algorithm Programming Library (GAP-Lib) is intended to
	make it easier to implement genetic algorithms for any purpose. The
	library itself implements most of the framework needed to handle one
	or several populations thus leaving the programmer free to concentrate
	on the purpose of her program.
	Some work will still be needed, specifically setting up a genotype,
	creating a fitness function and in some cases functions for
	initializing, mutating, crossing and deleting individuals.

   OVERVIEW
	GAP-Lib: A Genetic Algorithm Programming Library.

	A library for programming with genetic algorithms. The library features
	a simple yet flexible interface coupled with sensible default values
	and quite powerful built-in functionality to provide for both high and
	low-level programming.

	The GAP-Lib is primarily bit-oriented and this is reflected in the
	existing default-functions for crossover and  mutation. It is however
	possible to use almost any representation as long as the library
	itself only sees fixed-length individuals (Variable length individuals
	are possible though).

	A typical program using the GAP-Lib will begin by initializing the
	GAP environment by calling EnterGAP() then create a population using
	CreatePopulation() followed by some number of calls to Evolve() and
	finally ending with calling DeletePopulation().

	The current version as of 24-May-1999 is 0.82
	(Version 0, Revision 82).

	Current limitations include:

	 Not thread-safe (And not dynamically linked).
	 Need to implement variable-length individuals manually.
	 No special support for geographical environments.
	 No special support for parallell implementations.


GAP.lib/--data items--                                   GAP.lib/--data items--

   STRUCTURES
	GAP-Lib has three primary structures to keep track of data. One is the
	user-defined structure which describes an individual and though this
	structure is not always nessecary, it is highly recommended that you
	have one since it will help others to read your code.

	The other structure is the population structure which in turn includes
	a statistics structure. A member-by-member explanation of these
	structures follow here:

	struct Population {
	   long   NumPolys;
	   long   Generation;
	   long   Flags;
	   struct Popstat Stat;
	   long   Bytes;
	   void  *Polys;
	   void  *Magic;
	};

	NumPolys - This is the number of individuals in the population.
	Generation - This is how many times a generation shift has taken place.
	Flags - Internal status, do not touch.
	Stat - This is the statistics structure, see below.
	Bytes - Bytes per individual.
	Polys - This is for the internal list of individuals, do not touch.
	Magic - This is also internal, do not touch.

	struct Popstat {
	   double  AverageFitness;
	   double  MedianFitness;
	   double  TypeFitness;
	   long    TypeCount;
	   double  StdDeviation;
	   double  MaxFitness;
	   double  MinFitness;
	   void   *Max;
	   long    Generation;
	};

	AverageFitness - The average fitness of the population.
	MedianFitness - The median fitness of the population.
	TypeFitness - The type (most common) fitness value.
	TypeCount - The number of individuals with the type fitness.
	StdDeviation - The standard deviation of the fitness values.
	MaxFitness - The fitness value of the fittest individual.
	MinFitness - The fitness value of the least fit individual.
	Max - A pointer to the fittest individual after the last call to
	      Evolve().
	Generation - The generation for which these statistics are valid.

	The Popstat structure is read-only and it is important to remember
	that even if you copy the structure the Max pointer will become
	invalid the next time Evolve() is called.

   TAGLISTS
	A taglist is a list of pairs, the first member of the pair is the
	tag and determines what type of data the second member is. A typical
	member of a taglist could look like this:

	{EVL_Elite,5}
	 ^         ^
	 |	   |-> The data.
	 |-> The type of data.

	A complete taglist could look like this:

	struct TagItem MyTaglist[]={
	   {EVL_Evaluator, fitfunc}, /* Fitness function */
	   {EVL_Elite,     5}, /* No. of elite individuals */
	   {TAG_DONE,      0}  /* End-Tag */
	};

	The End-Tag, TAG_DONE, is a special tag common to all taglists. There
	are currently four such tags defined:

	TAG_DONE	- Marks the end of a taglist.
	TAG_END		- Equivalent to TAG_DONE.
	TAG_IGNORE	- This tag is ignored.
	TAG_MORE	- ti_Data is a pointer to a taglist with more tags,
			  processing of the current taglist will be terminated.

	As some of you might be a bit lazy ;-), there is also an alternative
	way of specifying taglists. At least in GAP-Lib there is. As an example
	we have the function Evolve() which also has and interface named
	EvolveT(), EvolveT() takes a variable number of arguments, the last
	of which make up the taglist. To use the above taglist with EvolveT()
	one would write:

	EvolveT(Pop,EVL_Evaluator,fitfunc,EVL_Elite,5,TAG_DONE);
		^
		|->This is not part of the taglist.

   PRIMITIVE TYPES
	GAP-Lib defines one primitive data type; IPTR. The IPTR is a type
	large enough to hold both an integer and a pointer, it is used for
	the data-part of a tagitem. IPTR can be considered equivalent to
	intptr_t as defined in the C9X ISO C-Language standard-to-be.


GAP.lib/CreatePopulation                               GAP.lib/CreatePopulation

   NAME
	CreatePopulation -- Allocates and initializes a population.
	CreatePopulationT -- Varargs interface to CreatePopulation.

   SYNOPSIS
	struct Population *CreatePopulation(long int,long int,struct TagItem *)
	struct Population *CreatePopulationT(long int,long int,...);

	Pop = CreatePopulation(Num,PSize,TagList);
	Pop = CreatePopulationT(Num,PSize,...);

   FUNCTION
	This function will allocate and initialize a population. If no
	initialization function is given, CreatePopulation() will simply
	randomize all bits in the created individuals. There is also a
	predefined initialization function which initializes every individual
	to a string of zero bits.

   INPUTS
	Num	 - Number of individuals to be created in this population.
	PSize	 - The byte-size of the individuals in this population.
	TagList  - A pointer to a taglist.

   TAGS
	POP_Init (void (*)(void *)) - A pointer to a function or one of the
	     values RAND_INIT or ZERO_INIT. Currently NULL is equivalent to
	     ZERO_INIT. A function to initialize an individual should take a
	     pointer to an individual and return nothing (void).

	POP_Destruct (void (*)(void *)) - A pointer to a function to be called
	     when deleting an individual. If you are allocating resources with
	     a custom initialization function, then you should supply this
	     tag. The function should take a pointer to an individual and
	     return nothing (void).

	POP_Cache (BOOL) - Set this to false if you are modifying the
	     individuals between calls to Evolve() or if you really need to
	     save memory. Default is TRUE which enables some caching of data.

   RESULT
	Pop	 - An initialized population structure or NULL if something
		   failed.

   NOTE
	CreatePopulation() could fail if EnterGAP() has not been called
	previously (Currently not).

   BUGS
	None known.

GAP.lib/Crossover                                             GAP.lib/Crossover

   NAME
	Crossover -- Perform crossover on two bitstrings.

   SYNOPSIS
	void Crossover(void *,void *,int,int);

	Crossover(void *Ind1,void *Ind2,int At,int Size);

   FUNCTION
	Performs one-point crossover of two bitstrings. The bitstrings must
	have the same length.

   INPUTS
	Ind1	- Pointer to the first bitstring (Individual).
	Ind2	- Pointer to the second bitstring (Individual).
	At	- Bit to perform crossover at.
	Size	- Size of bitstring in bytes. (OBS!: _BYTES_!!)

   RESULT
	None.

   NOTE
	Note well that all bitstrings must consist of a whole number of bytes.
	This is for reasons of simplicity and efficiency.

   BUGS
	None known.

GAP.lib/DeletePopulation                               GAP.lib/DeletePopulation

   NAME
	DeletePopulation -- Delete a previously allocated population.

   SYNOPSIS
	void DeletePopulation(struct Population *);

	DeletePopulation(Pop);

   FUNCTION
	Deletes a previously allocated population and frees all resources
	associated with it. If no custom deallocation function was given only
	the resources allocated by CreatePopulation() will be freed (If 
	CreatePopulation() was called without a custom initialization function,
	this is probably what you want).

   INPUTS
	Pop	- Pointer to the population to be deleted.

   RESULT
	None.

   BUGS
	None known.

   SEE ALSO
	CreatePopulation()


GAP.lib/EnterGAP                                               GAP.lib/EnterGAP

   NAME
	EnterGAP -- Initialize GAP environment.

   SYNOPSIS
	void EnterGAP(int Level);

	EnterGAP(Level);

   FUNCTION
	Initializes the GAP environment.

   INPUTS
	Level	- Level of verbosity at startup, supported values range from
		  0 to 2 with 0=Quiet, 1=Normal, 2=Verbose.

   RESULT
	0 for failure, non-zero for success.

   EXAMPLE
	int main(void)
	{
		/* Do some stuff here */
	...
	if(EnterGAP(1)) {
	...
	...	/* Do everything here. */
	...
	} else {
	   fprintf(stderr,"Initialization failed.\n");
	}

	return(0); /* Finished, exit. */
	}

   BUGS
	None known.

GAP.lib/Evolve                                                   GAP.lib/Evolve

   NAME
	Evolve -- Performs generation shift on a population.
	EvolveT -- Varargs interface to Evolve().

   SYNOPSIS
	struct Population *Evolve(struct Population *,struct TagItem *);
	struct Population *EvolveT(struct Population *,Tag,...);

	Pop = Evolve(Pop,TagList);
	Pop = EvolveT(Pop,Tag0Type,...);

   FUNCTION
	This is the big one. Evolve performs a generation shift, taking
	a population and returning a new one.

   INPUTS
	Pop	- Pointer to an initialized population structure.
	TagList - Pointer to a taglist.

   TAGS
	EVL_Evaluator (double (*)(void *)) - Pointer to a function taking
	     a pointer to an individual and returning its fitness value
	     as a double. Note well that this tag is _required_.
	     Also read the NOTE label further down.

	EVL_Mutator (void (*)(void *,int)) - Pointer to a mutator function
	     taking a pointer to an individual and its size. This function
	     should also decide if a mutation is to take place as it will be
	     called exactly once for every individual in the population. NULL
	     is a permitted value for this tag meaning that no mutation will
	     take place. The default is to use a built-in function designed to
	     mutate bitstrings.

	EVL_Crosser (void (*)(void *,void *,int)) - Pointer to a function which
	     performs crossover on two individuals. It should take two pointers
	     to individuals and their size and return nothing (void).
	     It will be called exactly once for every individual generated by
	     crossover. NULL is not a permitted value for this tag. The default
	     is to use a built-in function designed to perform crossover on two
	     bitstrings.

	EVL_Thermostat (double (*)(long,long)) - Pointer to a heat-regulating
	     function for Boltzmann selection (TEMPERATURE). The default
	     function is PopSize*(2.722-pow(1.0+1.0/Generation,Generation))
	     but this might change in later versions. The function takes
	     the size of the population as first argument and the generation
	     as second.

	EVL_Elite (int) - Sets the number of top individuals to copy from one
	     generation to the next without crossover (with the risk for
	     mutation though). Setting this value high will result in a
	     steady-state type of GA. The default value is 0.
	     Note!: Setting the Crowding flag currently alters the semantics of
	     this tag! If Crowding is in effect the Elite number is the number
	     of individuals not to generate. That is, in a population of
	     eg. 20 individuals an Elite value of 15 would mean generate
	     5 new individuals.

	EVL_Flags (unsigned long int) - Bulk initialization of flag tags
	     available flags are:

		FLG_InitDumped - Same as EVL_InitDumped
		FLG_EraseBest  - Same as EVL_EraseBest
		FLG_Crowding   - Same as EVL_Crowding
		FLG_Statistics - Same as EVL_Statistics

	     Example usage:  {EVL_Flags,FLG_Crowding|FLG_Statistics}
	     **NOTE** If using EVL_Flags, you must explicitly set
	     FLG_Statistics to generate statistics.

	EVL_Dump (int) - Sets the number of bottom (worst) individuals to dump
	     by replacing them with copies of the top (best) individuals.
	     Default is 0.

	EVL_Select (int) - Sets the select method used to determine parents
	     when generating new individuals. Available methods are:
	
		DRANDOM	    :	Double-random selection. A random individual
				and one of those fitter than the first one
				selected are chosen. (Default)

		FITPROP	    :	Fitness proportionate selection.

		SIGMA	    :	Sigma scaled fitness proportionate selection.

		TOURNAMENT  :	Tournament selection (fast).

		INORDER	    :	Inorder selection. The fittest individual is
				selected together with the rest in descending
				order of fitness.

		TEMPERATURE :	Boltzmann scaled selection. The selection
				pressure varies over time as determined by
				a 'heat' function. See also the EVL_Thermostat
				tag.

		UNIVERSAL   :	Universal stochastic selection (Improved
				variation on fitness proportionate selectsion).

	EVL_Stats (BOOL) - Generate statistics. Generating statistics will
	     increase processing time significantly compared to not doing it.
	     If statistics are enabled, the fitness function might be called
	     twice as many times. Once for every old individual for evaluation
	     and once for every new individual for generating statistics.
	     This is dependant on caching and previous state. When caching is
	     disabled, then the fitness function will always be called exactly
	     twice if generating statistics. Default is TRUE.

	EVL_PreMutate (BOOL) - Mutate old generation instead of new. This
	     will mutate the parent population before generating new
	     individuals. Note that this is done after evaluation so that
	     setting this tag to TRUE will mean that there is no nessecary
	     connection between good genes and a high fitness - only a
	     probability thereof (depending on the mutator function). This
	     emulates mutation occuring in mature individuals in nature.

	EVL_Newbies (int) - Number of new individuals to generate. The
	     individuals to replace will be randomly selected from the old
	     population. This could for example be used to keep the fitness
	     of a population down when co-evolving populations.

	EVL_Mensurator (double (*)(void *,void *,int)) - Pointer to a function
	     taking two pointers to individuals and their sizes and returning
	     the absolute value of the distance (dissimilarity measure) between
	     them. Default is to measure the Hamming distance between
	     individuals.

	EVL_Crowding (BOOL) - Use crowding replacement where each new
	     individual generated replaces the individual most like itself.
	     Note! This tag currently alters the meaning of the EVL_Elite
	     tag!

	EVL_InitDumped (BOOL) - If dumping individuals (see EVL_Dump above)
	     initialize them instead of replacing them with copies of the
	     fittest indiviuals.

	EVL_EraseBest (BOOL) - If generating new random individuals (see 
	     EVL_Newbies tag above) replace the fittest individuals instead
	     of random ones.

   RESULT
	Pop	- A pointer to the population structure or NULL is something
		  went horribly wrong.

   NOTE
	Note that Evolve always treats higher fitness values as better,
	this means that you must take care to transform your fitness
	values accordingly if needed before returning them.

   BUGS
	None currently known but if there are any major bugs, this is probably
	where they are.
