A Short Introduction to Genetic Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are a class of fairly recent and remarkably
powerful and flexible set of optimization/search strategies.

Genetic algorithms can be used for a multitude of problems such
as function optimization, searching for solutions, best-fit problems,
evolving rule-based control systems and much, much more.

The basic idea of genetic algorithms is the population. A set
of candidate solutions or partial solutions which can
be evaluated and compared to the other candidates in the set.

Historically, the most common type of representation for
genetic algorithms has been the bitstring. So, if for no other
reason than this, this mini introduction will only consider bitstrings.


A general genetic algorith can be described quite simply like this:


Let P be a set of candidate solutions to a problem such that each
candidate solution can be directly or indirectly evaluated and
assigned a fitness according to how good it is.

Pick candidates from P in such a manner that candidates with higher
fitness have a higher probability of being selected. Generate a new
individual from those picked by using crossover and mutation (explained
below) and repeat until |P| new candidates have been generated.
(|P| = the number of elements in P)

Form the set P' containing those individuals generated above.

Repeat until some criteria for stopping has been fulfilled. 



Crossover and mutation for bitstrings.


Consider the two bitstrings 1110100011 and 0101011101, the common crossover
operation for bistrings is simply a split-and-recombine operation. Let
this example illustrate:

Example:

Perform crossover of the above bitstrings a position 3 counted from the right
and beginning at zero.

      ---> Crossover point.
      |
1110100011	Old bitstrings
0101011101
----------x
1110101101	New bitstrings
0101010011
      ||||
      --------> These bits have now been swapped between the bitstrings.

Multipoint crossover is the same thing but with several crossover points,
this can be simulated by repeated singlepoint crossover.


Mutation is simple the random flipping of one or more bits.

Example:

1010000010
----------m
1110000010

 ---- Mutated bit.


The main idea is that 'good' sequences will stay in each
