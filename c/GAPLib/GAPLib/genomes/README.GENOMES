This directory contains some example genomes for GAP-Lib.

BitMatrix:
	A matrix, the entries of which are either 1 or 0.

RealMatrix:
	A matrix of real numbers.

BoundedRealVector:
	A vector of real numbers constrained to specified intervals.

(Note: Since computers have limited presicion, there are no actual real
numbers involved. It is actually a subset of the rational numbers.
If you did not understand this note you do not have to worry about it.)
