	This program is a completely rewritten version of DoRevision
	(Fish 325) from	Olaf Barthel.


Differences to DoRevision:

	It now can be used for assembler source files too, because BumpRev
	examines the file extension ('.c' or '.h' for C sources and '.asm'
	or '.i' for assembler sources).
	The size of the executable was reduced to 3.7 kb, but now the
	program is NOT portable anymore - it uses the ARP library and only
	three functions from c.lib (strrchr, strcpy and strlen).
	In this version the current day, date and time strings are
	generated with the function StampToStr from ARP library and it
	does not require DClock.
