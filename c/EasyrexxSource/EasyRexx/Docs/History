V3.2  07.Dec.95
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
New feature
 o The status' of the windows will now be saved in the environment file.
   Thus windows which are open when saving the environment settings will
   automatically be opened the next time EasyRexx is started.

Enhancement
 o A slightly faster update of the main window when manipulating arguments.

Fixes
 o Two corrections to the Oberon source generator.
 o The history file stated V3.0 instead of V3.1.
 o Some typos in the documentation.
 o Removed OLD bug in the autodoc which falsely stated that the context
   strings and the prompt string were duplicated.  That is not true,
   they are only referenced and must be valid for as long as you use
   the library.
 o The autodoc falsely stated that the ARexxCommandShellA() function
   sent commands directly to the application's ARexx port.  This was
   true in V1 and V2, but changed for the V3 release.


V3.1  05.Dec.95  - Released through my private homepage only.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed
 o Several fixes in the Oberon source generator.
 o Minor fixes to all catalog.
 o When quitting with Acknowledge ON, the Save&Exit requester was displayed
   twice.

 o More ARexx Interface Designer commands.
 o All ARexx commands entered in an ARexxCommandShell() are now sent to
   the system's ARexx port instead of directly to the program's ARexx port.
 o E, Modula-2 and Oberon source generators, examples and header files.

Fixes
 o Better documentation.
 o The ER_Font-tag was listed under SendARexxCommandA() instead of
   ARexxCommandShellA() as it should have been.
 o SendARexxCommandA() no longer cause enforcer-hit when trying to
   send commands asynchronously and no context has been provided,
   but exits gracefully instead.
 o SendARexxCommandA() needed the tag ER_Context ALWAYS even when
   commands was not sent asynchronously.
 o ARexx command SETVAR MAIN=1 did not work.
 o Made C include files compatible with C++. Assisted by Riccardo Solmi.
