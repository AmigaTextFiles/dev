These E modules where converted from the C includes. Source is included. If
you experience problems with these files, please mail me.

Notes for E programmers:

- If you need macro's, include `easyrexx_macros', and turn on macro
  preprocessing using 'OPT PREPROCESS' in your sources. The Designer
  utility always generates macro dependant sources.

- The static ChipMem recordpointer is emulated by a procedure call. Reason
  is E doesn't allow hunk definitions as of yet. I hope this will change.

- The contexttable pointer is initialized by a procedure, as E cannot declare
  static data easily. I hope this will change too.

Happy programming,
