Welcome to the Oberon-2-interface & demos to Ketil Hunn`s EasyRexx-library !

Both the library and the demos have been ported by *me* ;) [Volker Stolz
<Vok@TinDrum.tng.oche.de>] between November 3rd & 11th in `95.

Although I had enough things more urgent to do (i.e. spending more time
studying "Lineare Algebra I" & "Analysis") I still managed to finish
everything in time...Some parts may look strange at first glance (like
the work-around for the command-table in "Funcs", but - as stated in the
sources - I haven`t been able to do it an other way.
If you have any suggestions, comments or bug-reports, feel free to
contact me via eMail !

All sources are © 1995 by me but may be distributed freely as long as
they remain unchanged !

I`d like to thank

  Peter Froehlich

who helped me when I got terribly stuck because of something like a
compiler-bug (he still has to explain this to me !) and

  Ketil

for his patience !

Bye for now, back to mathematics ;)
