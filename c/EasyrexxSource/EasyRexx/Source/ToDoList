*** PUBLIC RELEASES ***********************************************************
Public Release 3.0 (03.12.95)
FIX: Loading an environment file which used had 'Own screen' set and when the
     window currently was on the Workbench strange things would happen.
FIX: When trying to close the Designer screen while there were alien windows
     on it, the Designer sometimes stated that it was unable to 'Iconify'...
FIX: Some optimization in the easyrexx.library source code.  Size reduced by
     100 bytes.
FIX: The About listview no longer always set top line = 0 when resized.
FIX: Changes in E source generator.  Reported by Leon Westenberg.
FIX: Changes in Modula-2 source generator.  Reported by Tom Breeden.
FIX: Oberon commandtable initialization.
FIX: Oberon source initialized a long to NIL.
FIX: Removed 'Things to do in the future' and 'History' in Programming.guide.
FIX: Small changes to Oberon source generator.
FIX: Uniconifying with the about window open crashed the program.
NEW: easyrexx.library uses less memory for each application.
NEW: The number of commands displayed in the About window is now updated
     every time the number of commands change.
NEW: Programming examples in E, Modula-2 and Oberon.
NEW: History as own document.
NEW: Pressign cursor up/down when a command/argument name has changed will
     rename the command/argument.
NEW: All windows' (not just the main window) status are saved in the
     environment file.

Public Release 3.1 (05.12.95)
FIX: Fixed several bug-fixes in the Oberon source generator.
FIX: Minor fixes in all catalog.
FIX: When quitting with Acknowledge ON the Save&Exit requester was displayed
     twice.
ENH: A slightly faster update of the main window.

Public Release 3.2 (07.12.95)
FIX: Two corrections to the Oberon source generator.
FIX: The history file stated V3.0 instead of V3.1.
FIX: Some typos and smaller corrections in the documentation and autodoc.
FIX: Removed OLD bug in the autodoc which falsely stated that the context
     strings and the prompt string were duplicated.  That is not true,
     they are only referenced and must be valid for as long as you use
     the library.
FIX: The autodoc falsely stated that the ARexxCommandShellA() function
     sent commands directly to the application's ARexx port.  This has
     changed in V3.
NEW: The status' of the windows will now be saved in the environment file.
     Thus windows that are open when saving the environment settings will
     automatically be opened the next time EasyRexx is started.
ENH: A slightly faster update of the main window when manipulating arguments.
