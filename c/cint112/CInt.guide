@node "WhatisaCInterpreter" "What is a C Interpreter"
 Normally, all C programs must be compiled first and then executed in order
for the user to check their programs. Well, this isn't very convinient for
users that are familiar with BASIC or PASCAL or other higher-level
programming languages, than C.

 Herein the C interpreter comes for. This program will allow C users to
"run" their program in a "supervised" mode. This means that C programs will
be interpreted instead of compiled, so it would be easier - theoretically -
to debug your programs.

 Theoretically means that it isn't possible to emulate 100% the C compiler
with the interpreter, since C is a "compiler based" language, so it relies
heavily on the preprocessor, the linker and assembler.

 See C Interpreter @{"Limits" link "Limits" 0} section for supported index of C functions.

  The C Interpreter requires KickStart 2.0 and above to run correctly.

  The C Interpreter is a CLI/Shell Utility, which means it can be run ONLY
from a CLI or Shell. Just type "CInt" at the command prompt, followed by the
name of the C source file you want to execute.

 Important Notice: Since this version of C Interpreter IS case-sensitive,
you should be very careful with filenames. For example, if your C source
file is called "test.c" you should invoke the command:

                CInt test.c
 and not
                 CInt test
 
 The second command argument will simply ignore your program.
 
 Study the example files provided in order to get an idea about what the
interpreter does.

  The following are NOT supported in this version:
  
  - #includes, #defines, and ALL preprocessor stuff
  - Input or Output in ANY way.
  - Cases, if's and the rest.
  - Subroutines, calls and mathematical functions
  - Long, double numbers.
  - No structures are allowed
  - i++, ++i, --i and i-- . Use i=i+1 instead
  
  The following are supported:
  
  - Unlimited number of branches
  - Unlimited number of nests
  - Simple arithmetic operators
  - Only supports "char" and "int" data types
  - No structures are allowed
  - Nested for loops must be delineated with '{' and '}'

 A VERY simple input/output system is supported with the following commands

   - puts       - put a string such as "Hello World" on the console.
   - print      - put an integer or string on the console.  IE
                  print(1)  will print "1" on the console.
                  print("Hello world") will print "Hello World".
   - getnum     - get a signed integer from the console.

  
 As you can see, there are a LOT of limitations in this version; however as
this is a "trial and error" version this is acceptable. If I get enough
@{"respond" link "Respond" 0} from you ( see Respond ), I will write a NEW optimized version which
will hopefully support more things... :-)

 This program is PD software. However it is copyrighted by Manolis S Pappas.
You can give copies of this to every person who owns an Amiga, but you may
NOT MODIFY the main executable or the ReadMe files in ANY WAY.

 I do not want money, just your respond. Write me a letter, send me a
postcard, things like that. I just want to know how far this program went.
