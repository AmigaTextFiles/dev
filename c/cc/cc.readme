Porting Makefiles from Unix for SMake or DMake and vice versa is
rather nasty. cc allows to use the Unix-Makefiles with sc and dcc
without modification. (Hopefully :-)

cc is just a program which reads command line options, converts them
and calls sc or dcc.

Supported options are:

	-sas	    Run as a frontend of SAS/C
	-dice	    Run as a frontend of Dice
	-gcc	    Run as a frontend of gcc (Default)
	
	Best way is to put one of these into the environment variable
	CCOPT.


	-v	    Verbose (try it :-)
	-c	    Don't link
	-a	    Compile only, don't assemble
	-E	    Run preprocessor only
	-I<dir>     Look for include files in directory <dir>
	-L<dir>     Look for libraries in directory <dir>
	-o<file>    Set the name of the created file; it is recommended
		    to use this as the respective frontends might behave
		    different in selecting default names.
	-D<symbol>  Defines preprocessor symbol; use -Dsymbol=var for
		    specific values.
	-U<symbol>  Undefine the preprocessor symbol <symbol>.
	-l<lib>     Link with library <lib>.
	-g	    Turn debugging on.
	-O	    Optimize
