   A GUI for various text editing & formatting tools used for generating 
   source code.

   V3.1 includes ProgrammerAssistPPC, which is compiled & verified to run on the
   AmigaOne & AmigaOS4.
   
   When the program Icon gets clicked on, nothing will happen until you
   press the @{" HOTKEY " LINK "ToolTypes"} defined in the Icon's ToolTypes array.
   Only then will the GUI appear & allow you to use the program.  This is
   because the Program appears as a@{BOLD Commodity} to the Amiga-OS.
      
  @{BOLD HISTORY}
       1.0 ProgrammerAssist is now working correctly!

       1.1 Added Commodity capability to the program so that it
           can be placed in the WBStartup drawer.

       1.2 Changed the method in which the Indent program is invoked,
           since the Indent program uses -o OutputFile for specifying
           that an output file is to be used.

       1.3 Added the TabLength ToolType & removed some unnecessary 
           Delay() calls.

       1.4 Added the ability to open at the same directory to the 
           ASL button Gadget.

       1.5 Added the PathValid() function to the ASL button Gadget &
           ActivateProgram(), in order to make sure that garbage is not
           in the ASL FileRequester Drawer String Gadget when it opens.

       1.6 Added code to open on the Active Screen.

       1.7 Changed some of the vanilla keys for button gadgets.

       1.8 Added the code for the @{" Adjust " LINK "Adjust"} button gadget.

       2.0 Added ProgrammerAssistPPC for the AmigaOne & AmigaOS4.
      
       3.0 Added AmigaOS4 & gcc support.
   
       3.1 Minor cleanup.

   There are several menu items associated with ToolTypes:
   
      @{B}Save ToolTypes@{UB}    - Save ToolTypes from the ListViewer to the 
                          Program Icon. @{SHINE "WARNING!"} There is no undo feature
                          for this.  Keep a backup copy of the Icon if
                          you wish to keep the original settings.
      
      @{B}Restore ToolTypes@{UB} - Reset the ToolTypes ListView contents to the 
                          ToolTypes present in the Icon.
                          @{FG SHINE}WARNING:  @{FG TEXT}Once the @{B}Save ToolTypes@{UB} menu item has
                                    been selected, this button won't be
                                    of any use to you.
      
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ToolTypesLV"
@PREV "Main"

   When you select a ToolType from this ListView Gadget, it gets written
   into the @{" ToolType " LINK "ToolTypeString"} string Gadget below.  You may change the ToolType 
   there, but it will not take effect unless you save the ToolTypes.  Even
   then, the @{" CX_PRIORITY " LINK "ToolTypes"} might @{B}NOT@{UB} be changed until your Amiga is Reset.
   
   Since the Program is a Commodity, this means you have to remove the 
   program using Exchange or a similar program.  Alternatively, you can 
   edit the ToolTypes in the Icon before the program gets started.

   Any changes made to the ToolTypes won't be sent to the Icon until the
   @{" Save ToolTypes " LINK "ToolTypes"} menu item is selected.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ToolTypeString"
@PREV "ToolTypesLV"

   When you select a ToolType from the @{" ListView Gadget " LINK "ToolTypesLV"}, it gets written
   into this string Gadget.  You may change the ToolType here, but it
   will not take effect until the program exits.  Since the Program is a
   Commodity, this means you have to remove the program using Exchange
   or a similar program.  Alternatively, you can edit the ToolTypes in the
   Icon before the program gets started.
   
   Any changes made to the ToolTypes won't be sent to the Icon until the
   @{" Save ToolTypes " LINK "ToolTypes"} menu item is selected.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "VanillaKeys" "Keys that ProgrammerAssist recognizes:"
@PREV "Main"
  @{SHINE "a or A:"}Same as pressing the @{" Amiga -> IBM" LINK "AmigaIBM"} Button.

  @{SHINE "b or B:"}Same as pressing the @{"IBM -> Amiga" LINK "IBMAmiga"} Button.

  @{SHINE "c or C:"}Same as pressing the @{" CodeEdit " LINK "CodeEdit"} Button.

  @{SHINE "d or D:"}Same as pressing the @{" Adjust " LINK "Adjust"} Button.

  @{SHINE "e or E:"}Same as pressing the @{" AmigaGuideEdit " LINK "AmigaGuideEdit"} Button.

  @{SHINE "h or H:"}Show the user some info on the program (same as selecting the
           @{B}Info...@{UB} menu item).

  @{SHINE "i or I:"}Same as pressing the @{" Indent " LINK "Indent"} Button.

  @{SHINE "t or T:"}Same as pressing the @{" DeTab " LINK "DeTab"} Button.

  @{SHINE "x, X, q or Q:"}Same as pressing the Close Window Gadget.

   @{B}NOTE:@{UB}  The Close Window Gadget (or equivalent) only closes the window,
          it does not end the program because it's a Commodity.  This means
          you have to remove the program using @{B}Sys:Tools/Commodities/Exchange@{UB} or a similar 
          program if you wish to end the program completely. 
@ENDNODE


@NODE "AmigaGuideEdit" "AmigaGuideEdit Button:"
@PREV "Main"

   Run the ToolType-defined AmigaGuide Editor on the file specified in the
   @{" File Name " LINK "FileName"} string gadget.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "CodeEdit" "CodeEdit Button:"
@PREV "Main"

    Run the ToolType-defined Code Editor on the file specified in the
    @{" File Name " LINK "FileName"} string gadget.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Adjust" "Adjust Button:"
@PREV "Main"

   @{FG SHINE} New for V1.8:@{FG TEXT}

    Bring up a Requester allowing the user to specify the line length
    & indentation size in order to split a text file into smaller, indented
    lines.  This is used if there are not enough newlines in the source
    file, which forces you to have to scroll the file horizontally in order
    to read it.
    
@ENDNODE

@NODE "DeTab" "DeTab Button:"
@PREV "Main"

    Change all Tab characters into @{" TabLength " LINK "ToolTypes"} spaces.
    The Default number of spaces is 3.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "AmigaIBM" "Amiga->IBM Button:"
@PREV "Main"

    Translate Amiga TextFiles into something that an IBM clone can use.  
    This means replacing all LineFeeds with a Carriage Return-LineFeed 
    combination, so your teletype will operate properly!

    Don't ya just hate that 70's technology known as CPM (a.k.a. MS_DOS)?

@ENDNODE

@NODE "IBMAmiga" "IBM->Amiga Button:"
@PREV "Main"

    Translate IBM TextFiles into something that the Amiga can use.  This 
    means removing all Carriage Return-LineFeed combinations & replacing 
    them with Linefeeds only.  Don't ya just hate that 70's technology
    known as CPM (a.k.a. MS_DOS)?

@ENDNODE

@NODE "HomeEnv" "HOME Environmental variable:"
@PREV "Indent"
@NEXT "Main" 

   You can create an Environmental variable on the Amiga by placing:
   
   @{FG SHINE}setenv@{FG TEXT} @{B}HOME@{UB} "Path:to/.indent.pro" into your User-Startup file, or 
   by invoking the same command inside a CLI or Shell program.  This makes
   your life easier by requiring you to only keep @{B}one@{UB} copy of @{B}.indent.pro@{UB}
   in your filing system.  @{FG SHINE}setenv@{FG TEXT} is an AmigaDOS command.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Indent" "Indent Button:"
@PREV "Main"
@NEXT "HomeEnv"

    Run the @{B}indent@{UB} program on the file specifed in the @{" File Name " LINK "FileName"}
    string gadget in order to format C source code according to 
    @{FG SHINE}@{B}.indent.pro@{UB}@{FG TEXT} settings.  The current version of @{B}indent@{UB} that 
    ProgrammerAssist expects to see is:  ??? (55308 bytes) or greater.
    Those GNU/Unix bozos don't use a version string that the Amiga OS
    can find, so look for the one that will take the -o argument & will
    know about the @{" HOME " LINK "HomeEnv"} environmental variable.  I've included a copy
    of the @{FG SHINE}indent@{FG TEXT} program in this distribution, along with its docu-
    mentation.  There is also an example of a @{B}.indent.pro@{UB} file included.
    
@ENDNODE

@NODE "FileName" "File Name string Gadget:"
@PREV "Main"

   Either enter the file you wish to transform in this gadget, or press
   the @{" ASL file requester " LINK "ASLRequester"} button to the right in order to select a file
   from the filing system.

  ProgrammerAssist was originally written using @{B}SAS-C V6.58@{UB}.

  ProgrammerAssistPPC was compiled using @{B}gcc V2.95.3@{UB} on my AmigaOne
  PowerPC & AmigaOS4+.

  The GUI was put together with GadToolsBox V37.300 (14.3.93) (C)
  1991-1993 by Jaba Development.  I wish that there was an easy way to pay
  for this godsend of a program (Thanx guys!).
