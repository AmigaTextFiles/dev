Calls is a program which will print out the function calling hierarcy of all
or some part of a 'C' program. It is a great tool to run when looking at 
new code to help figure out what the heck it's doing. I tried it on some of
my old code, highly illuminating!

The author of the original code is unknown to me, I do know it was 
significantly modified by Kevin S. Braunsdorf and then posted on Usenet(Unix
users network).

In porting it to the Amiga I could not find a way to pre-process the source 
files using the manx package. As such the following options as described in 
the original man page will not do anything:  -D, -U, -I.  
I did try out the rest of the options and it seems to work fine. Also since 
the pre-processor is not used to expand macros, any functions called by the 
macro will be hidden. This should not affect the functionality too much, 
just be aware that some macros will show up as functions in the output.

I modified the Unix manual page and put it in calls.amiga.man, so read it
next to figure out how to use the program.
