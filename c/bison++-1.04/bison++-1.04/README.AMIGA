Bison++ v1.04 for the Amiga

This archive contains a port of the Unix version of Bison++, a LALR(1)-parser
generator creating parsers in C++.
So if you belong to the happy people owning one of the few useful C++ compilers
for the Amiga, you may create REAL C++ parsers with this program.

The original was downloaded from iamsun.unibe.ch (C++/Tools). Don't blame me
for dead code or other similar things, I made the port in half an hour :-)
The sources should compile with SAS/C 6.5 without properly (the warnings can
be ignored).

To install Bison++, copy the following files to S: and "bison++" to a directory
of your search path:

  - bison++.hairy.cc 
  - bison++.simple.cc

Bison++ needs these two frame files for the parser generation. You may tell
Bison++ which file to take by setting the environment variables BISON_HAIRY
and BISON_SIMPLE respectively.
