*** TO DO *****************************************************************************

Recall:
o date window
o Kopier dato
o Uregistrert i Om... tekst
o FailRequest must end with a NULL
o more helpnodes (windows etc.)
o gå gjennom alle filer => // og /* */

Installer:
o install script (default catalog etc.)
o change in recreg message key->S:

Recall:
o next/previous month ++/--

DOC:
o change in recreg message key->S:
o better description on how to use repeat and period
o DocNode: Describing Recall
o Include a short description of usage with InfraRexx
o next/previous month ++/--

*** KNOWN BUGS ************************************************************************
o Inconsistency between fields {DD/MM/YYYY} and displayed date in the date-window
  which is localized.  Reported by Adam Szymczak.
o Repeating events for example every 4 month before/after a certain date does not
  work (i.e. before 10th each 4th month).  Reported by Giovanni Addabbo.
o Doesn't calculate years right (< 8. May)
o MoreReq sometimes cause enforcer hits.  Normally the first time it is shown
o Input rawchars isn't fast enough.  All characters aren't rendered
o Purge module does not work at all!

*** FUTURE ****************************************************************************
o ARexx support.
o only run AREXX strings and scripts IF easyrexx.library is found
o new event: ARexx string
o New window: Categories.  Group only events of same category.
  Suggested by Adam Szymczak.
o Chronological order display module
o synchronize timer
o Extend Purge module.  FILE: ram:archive.project
o Installer must keep old Recall.project
o UNIVERSAL loader
o Install alternate icons
o Installer should ask if the user wants to have a project icon to RecallPrefs in SYS:Prefs
o Installer should set TOOLTYPE <language=<installer.language>>  ASK!
o IMPORTANT: Try to use less memory when Recall is resident in memory
o New event and dir should be inserted below the highlighted node
o Find some way to move events up and down
o Optimize dateselectegadclass (only update when necessary...)
o Set up fake rastport and check all textlengths there...  Check out DSG_Dims
o GroupFrame BOOPSI class
o AREXX
o Macros (menu or perhaps toolbar)
o Merge MoreReq.library into EasyGadgets.library  (??)
o INTERNAL: Semaphores whenever parsing folders
o Semaphores on textlist and datelist (a MUST for user modules)
o MoreReq should ghost buttons -> "0100" : ghost button 2
o Optimize Sort by Date
o AREXX-scripts: Datenow, Timenow, Dateclear, Timeclear
