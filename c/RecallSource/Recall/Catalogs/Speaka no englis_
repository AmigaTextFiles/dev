 If your language is not supported by Recall, it is just because no one has
 translated it yet!  If you are  available  by e-mail and want to translate
 Recall into your language, contact me through e-mail, and I'll send you the
 necessary files.  You must also be  available  for updates of the catalogs
 for new versions etc. etc.

 Poeple who take the effort  of  translating  the  program and it's instal-
 lation-script, will be fully credited in the documentation.

 You can get in contact with me via e-mail, if there are any questions.
