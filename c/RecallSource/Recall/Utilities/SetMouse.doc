SetMouse V1.0   © 1995 Ketil Hunn
=================================

Small utility to move the mousepointer to any coordinates on the
screen.  Useful for Recall Input events since the position of the
mousepointer is not accessible through the rawmouse input class.

Usage:
SetMouse XPOS=NUMBER/A/N,YPOS=NUMBER/A/N

Examples:
SetMouse 50 100              (mousepointer jumps to X=50 Y=100)
SetMouse XPOS=50 YPOS=100
SetMouse -1 -1               (centres the mousepointer on the screen)

Hint:
I also call 'SetMouse -1 -1' in my S:Startup-Sequence right before the
Workench screen is opened, so the mousepointer alway appear centred
on the screen (as in MS-Windows).

SetMouse V1.0 is FREEWARE!
