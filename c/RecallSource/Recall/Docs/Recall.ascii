Description

 Do have a tendency to forget  birthdays, anniversaries and other important
 events?

 Well, there are plenty of products  on  the  market that will prevent that
 from happening.

 But, do you also want to
 o be reminded with requesters, alerts or  practically anything that can be
   displayed on an Amiga-monitor?
 o automatically start programs (CLI/WB/AREXX/BATCH) depending on the date,
   time or weekday?
 o create input events at certain days/time/weekday?
 o keep track of the remaining days/time to important events?
 o keep track of the days/time since important events happened?
 o be reminded every # day (e.g. every 14th day)?
 o be reminded # days before or after the event
 o be reminded once a day, every time  you  boot, before or after a certain
   date, before or after a certain hour or minute?
 o be reminded about events until you acknowledge them?
 o be reminded on certain weekdays?
 o display unlimited lines of text in the same requester or alert?
 o group different events and make them appear simultaneously?
 o keep a simple database of the birthdays of family and friends?
 o let your Amiga keep track of how  old  people are by insterting the date
   of birth in the middle of the string  where you want to display the age?
   (I.e. the text  "Adam  is  {years:08/05/1970}  years  old  today" may be
   displayed as "Adam is 24 years old today".)
 o make advanced events which are  displayed  for example after 21:00 every
   3rd day the  first  7  days  of  every  2nd month the next 4 years?
 o combine all of the attributes mentioned above in the same event?
 o enter these events  in  an  easy-to-use,  totally adaptable multi-window
   environment and  without  the  need  of  programming-knowledge,  just by
   entering the desired text and pressing a few buttons?

 Well, then you will  find  this  program  extremely useful, because Recall
 will do exactly  that  for  you!   It  is  an easy-to-use, intuition-based
 utility for the absent-minded!

Copyrights & distribution

 All binaries and documentation are copyrighted (C) 1993,1994,1995 to Ketil
 Hunn.

 Due to the great  amount  of  work  this  version  required, Recall is now
 released as SHAREWARE.  You are  allowed  to  use this copy for evaluation
 for maximum ONE week.  You are not allowed to use this software after that
 period has expired, unless you  pay  the  shareware  fee  of US $15 or 100
 Norwegian kroner (do not  send  other  currencies,  since the exchange fee
 would quickly exceed the shareware fee).

 People who pay the shareware  fee  and  are available through e-mail, will
 automatically receive new releases of Recall through e-mail (optional).

 Unregistered users will not be able to save projects larger than 10 events.
 When you register, you  will  be  sent  a  private  coded  Recall key that
 removes this limitation.

Distributability

 The archive may be  spread  through  BBS,  Internet,  AmiNet and on Public
 Domain disks as long as  the  archive  is  not  modified in any way.  This
 means that you can copy it freely as long as you don't ask for a more than
 nominal copying fee.  This fee must not  be  more  than US $5 or 5 DM.  It
 would be much  appreciated  if  magazines  notified  me  through e-mail or
 ordinary mail if they include Recall on a cover-disk.

 If you wish to include Recall on a  magazine  cover disk, you may do so as
 long as you send a complimentary  copy  of  the magazine issue in which it
 appears to my home address.  The  entire  package  must be included on the
 disk, not just the executable.  Please contact me in advance to ensure you
 have the latest version.

 If you wish to supply Recall as  part of a CD-ROM compilation of freeware,
 you may do so as  long  as  the  disc  contains  at  least  20 Mb of other
 freeware.  Otherwise, contact  me  first  please.  Explicit  permission is
 granted to distribute Recall on any  CD-ROM  produced by Fred Fish / Amiga
 Library Services, and on any  officially  supported Aminet compilation CD-
 ROM.

Installing

 I am not going to go through   the  whole installation process here, since
 most of  you  are  already   familiar  with  Commodore's  Installer.  Just
 doubleclick on the  install-icon,  and  the  program  will  install itself
 automatically (just answer a few questions...).  All files except the font
 will be placed in a  private  drawer  called  'Recall'.   The font will be
 copied to your 'FONTS:' directory.

 Beginning with version 2.1,  the  installation-script  is localized.  Just
 click on the preferred language  and  the  installation and it's questions
 will be given in that language.

 The script  needs  Commodore's  'Amiga  Application  Installation Utility'
 (Installer) in order to run.  This is not included in this package because
 it is copyrighted to Commodore.   The  Installer  utility  is shipped with
 WB2.1 and higher.
 
 IMPORTANT It  is  important  that  you  do   not  move  Recall  or  Recall
           Preferences outside the Recall  drawer,  or  else it cannot find
           the necessary  files.   If  you  absolutely  *MUST*,  you should
           create project icons pointing to the Recall drawer instead!

Running the programs

 Both programs may be run from Shell or from Workbench by doubleclicking on
 their icons.  Recall may be terminated using Ctrl-C.

 Recall will install itself as  a  commodity  and may be controlled through
 the Exchange program.   Tooltypes  may  be  used  to  override the default
 settings in both programs.

 General tooltypes:
 FROM=<filename>       - Project   filename    to    use.     Defaults   to
                         Recall/Projects/Recall.project.
 LANGUAGE=<language>   - Force Recall programs to use another language than
                         the default selected language.   When not provided
                         the default locale will be used.
 USEREQTOOLS=<switch>  - Set to  TRUE/YES  or  FALSE/NO,  TRUE/YES  telling
                         Recall to use  reqtools.library REQUESTERS instead
                         of  the  standard  requesters.   When  present  in
                         Recall Preferences,  ReqTools  requesters  will be
                         used when testing the project.  This tooltype must
                         be present  in  order  to  centre  requesters when
                         testing the project.  Defaults to NO.

 Recall Preferences tooltypes:
 HELP=<filename>       - Path and name of the AmigaGuide documentation.  By
                         default, Recall will first  look  for the guide in
                         the  drawer  from  where  the  Recall  Preferences
                         program was  started  and  then  the  HELP:english
                         drawer.

 Recall tooltypes:
 DONOTWAIT             - Should be present if  Recall  is started from your
                         WBstartup drawer.
 CX_PRIORITY=<value>   - Sets the priority of the Recall commodity.
 WAIT=<value>          - The idle time in seconds  between each time Recall
                         checks the project.   Will  only  be  affective if
                         STAYRESIDENT is positive.  Defaults  to  60 (every
                         minute).
 STAYRESIDENT=<switch> - Set to  TRUE/YES  or  FALSE/NO,  TRUE/YES  telling
                         Recall to stay resident  in  memory.  If negative,
                         Recall will run through the  project once and then
                         exit (If any programs were  launched, it will wait
                         until the terminates).  Defaults to NO.
 BUFFERSIZE=<value>    - Sets the size in  bytes  of  the textbuffer Recall
                         will need.  Defaults to 3000.


 Running from Workbench
 Doubleclick on the icon to run  the  program.  Tooltypes may be entered by
 clicking once on the icon and selecting the item 'Icons->Information' from
 the Workbench.  Please refer to  your  manual  'Using the System Software'
 for further details.

 Running from Shell
 Enter the name of the program to start at the shell-prompt.  Tooltypes may
 be entered directly after the program name.  E.g.:

 Recall FROM=myproject.prefs STAYRESIDENT=YES WAIT=3600

How to handle the CPU workload

 Recall is designed to use  as  little  CPU-time as possible.  When loading
 the project it converts the project to  a format that may easily be parsed
 (without recursion or calculation of  dates  etc.).  A normal project will
 take up 1-2 1n some tenths of a  second every time the project is checked
 for events.  It will of course use more of the CPU-time when an events are
 displayed...

 When running other applications that  requires  much of the available CPU-
 time, you may  easily  disable  Recall  by  setting  the  task to Inactive
 through Commodore's Exchange program.

 Hints on how to decrease the CPU workload:
 o Set the WAIT tooltype to more than  the default 60 seconds.  If checking
   once in a hour is sufficient for you, then set the WAIT value to 3600.
 o Start Recall without the STAYRESIDENT tooltype or set it to FALSE/NO.


Using Recall Preferences

 The Recall Preferences program is  used  to  create  and maintain your own
 project of events.

Describing the graphic user interface

 Much work has been done to  make  the graphic user interface intuitive and
 easy to use.  Here are some of its features:

 o Multi-window environment.  The windows work  independently of each other
   and are 'multitasking'.
 o All windows are font-adaptable and sizeable.
 o The program can either  display  its  windows  on  the Workbench, on the
   default public screen or open an own  screen of any resolution, size and
   depth.
 o Most gadgets have keyboard equivalents for easy execution.
 o The windows will remember it's attributes when closed and reopened.
 o All environment attributes may be saved to disk.
 o On-line help for all windows, gadgets and menu-items.
 o Pop-up requesters
 o Image buttons where appropriate.
 o Recall comes with a nice  font  which  looks good on both non-interlaced
   and interlaced screens.

 Listviews may be controlled using the arrow-keys:

 Cursor up           - Previous item
 Cursor down         - Next item

 Shift Cursor up     - Previous page
 Shift Cursor down   - Next page

 Control Cursor up   - Top item
 Control Cursor down - Bottom item
 Alt Cursor up       - Top item
 Alt cursor down     - Bottom item

 Return              - Enter a folder/edit name


 NOTE: A gadget-shortcut may be cancelled  by  pressing  another key or the
       alt-qualifier while holding the shortcut-key down.

Using on-line help

 Recall has a built-in help function  that  can  pop up help on any window,
 gadget or menu-item directly from the program.  This function is activated
 when positioning the mouse-pointer over a  window, gadget or menu-item and
 then pressing the HELP-key on your keyboard.

 AmigaGuide is opened asynchronously, meaning  that  it will be launched as
 separate task, independently from  Recall.   This  allows  you to continue
 your work while help is being displayed.

 If you wish to select help  on  another  subject while AmigaGuide is open,
 just activate the desirable window,  place  the pointer at another object,
 press HELP and AmigaGuide  will  show  text  on  that  subject without you
 having to close its window and load everything again.

 The latest versions of AmigaGuide allows  you  to save position, width and
 height  of  the  AmigaGuide-window.   When  the  on-line  help  system  is
 activated later, AmigaGuide will open at  the coordinates last saved.  You
 should only save the AmigaGuide settings  if  Recall  is opened on its own
 screen or else the settings will affect all the other programs as well.

 The documentation was  designed  to  be  displayed  in  a  640 pixels wide
 window, but it will wordwrap the text if the window is made smaller.

 NOTE 1: In order for the on-line help system to work, 'amigaguide.library'
         must be available on your system.


Modules

 Recall allows its  functionality  to  be  extended  through modules.  This
 means that functions can be added later  or  you could even write your own
 modules and Recall will automatically  detect  and  run them when they are
 selected from the menu.

 Recall handles 4 types of modules:

  Import     
  Export     
  Operators  
  Displayers 


 See also  Developer info 


Describing the import modules

 Import-modules are modules that allows  easy converting from other formats
 to the Recall  project  format.   All  import  modules  may  be started by
 selecting the sub-items  in  the  menu  'Project->Import'.   If no import-
 modules were installed, Recall will not show this sub-menu.

 Currently, Recall comes with the following import-modules:

 ASCII
 Imports an ASCII project into Recall  Preferences.  This loader module can
 be very useful to convert  birthday  databases  to  a Recall project since
 most databases can save their  data  in  ASCII format.  The ASCII-file may
 need some changes before it can be imported by Recall.  All ASCII texts in
 the following format are accepted:

 EVENT/A,DATE/A,TIME/A,TEXT/M/A

 All items must be  enclosed  in  quotation  marks  '"'  and separated by a
 comma.  NOTE! NO comma at end of line!   As stated, TEXT may occur as many
 times as you wish.  If  these  fields  do  not  exist  in you database, it
 should quite easy to create them globally before exporting it as an ASCII-
 file. Example:

 "Remember","29.08.1993","11:00","To put your jeans on BEFORE your shoes!"


 Recall V1.x
 Imports a Recall V1.x project.

 Recall V2.x
 Imports a Recall V2.x project.

Describing the export modules

 Export modules are modules  that  allows  easy  converting from the Recall
 project format to another formats. All  saver  modules can be started from
 the menu 'Project->Export'. If no export modules were installed, this menu
 item will not be available.

 Currently, Recall comes with the following export modules:

 ASCII
 Exports a Recall project to an  ASCII-file.  The ASCII-format is described
 under import modules.

Describing the displayer module

 Displayers are modules that will display  the  data in a Recall project in
 any other way than provided through the Recall Preferences program.  If no
 displayer modules are installed, this menu will not be shown at all.

 Currently, Recall comes with these displayer modules:

 Browser

 Lists all events in the same listview. Allows you to browse through events
 easily.  You may  jump  to  an  event  by  double-clicking  in the browser
 listview or pressing the 'Jump to'-button.

Describing the operator modules

 Operators are modules  that  will  alter  the  list  in  any  way.   If no
 operators are installed, this menu will only have one item: 'Last saved'.

 Currently, Recall comes with this operator module:

 Sort
 Sorts the list of events  by  their  names  or  dates.   You also have the
 option of displaying folders first or last.

Developer info

 Sorry, no Recall developer information  are  available yet.  I'm currently
 working on the API Recall should  use  when communicating with the modules
 through message ports (so you won't  need  to re-compile your module every
 time a new version of Recall is released...)

 You must be registered as an Recall user before you are allowed to release
 a Recall module.


Main window

 This is the main window where all the events are listed.  Manipulating the
 events listed in the listview will  affect  the contents of Text, Date and
 Attributes windows.

Creating an event

 You can add a new event  to  the  list  by  clicking  on 'New' in the main
 window.  The  stringgadget  below  the  listview  will  become  activated,
 allowing you to enter the name of  the  event.   The length of the name is
 limited to 255 characters.

 If you have many events of the  same type (i.e. birthdays), they should be
 grouped together in a folder.

 The name you enter, will only be  added  to  the list if you press return.
 Failing to do so, will  cancel  the  creation  of the new event.  Pressing
 return will add the new event  at  the  bottom  of the list.  The listview
 will automatically scroll the list to  show  the  new event. The new event
 will be highlighted to indicate that it is the current active event.

 The number of events are only limited by the available memory.


 See also  Making a folder 


Using cut

 Several windows have a Cut-button.   This  button  can  be used to delete,
 copy or move data between different events/folders.

 When selected, Recall will copy the  selected  data to a buffer and remove
 it from the listview.  Recall will detect  what  kind of data is being cut
 and place it in its own buffer.   Currently buffers exist for these types:
 Event, Text and Date.

 Any subsequent calls  to  Cut  will  erase  the  contents  of the specific
 buffer.


 See also  Using paste 


Using paste

 Several windows have a Paste-button.  This  button can be used to retrieve
 any data in a buffer.   This  button  is  disabled  if the buffer does not
 contain data (this does not  happen  to the Textwindow Paste-button, since
 the buffer may contain text copied/cut from other applications).

 When selected, Recall will insert a  copy  of  the buffer in the listview.
 The buffer will not be emptied!  This allows you to duplicate data.


 See also  Using cut 


Recursive folders

 Recall folders are pointers  to  a  group  of  events.  A possible project
 could look like this:

 rootlist
    |
  event1---list of texts---list of dates
    |           |                |
    |         text1            date1
    |           |
    |         text2
    |
   dir1------children
    |           |
    |         event1.1-----list of texts...
    |           |                |
    |           |              text1
    |           |
    |          dir1.1---------children
  event2        |                |
              event1.2        event2.1----list of texts...

 etc.

 When displaying this project it would show the events in this order:
 event1
 event1.1
 event2.1
 event1.2
 event2

 So when Recall discovers a folder,  that  folder will be parsed before any
 succeeding events in the current list.

 More levels of folders requires  more  stack  and  Recall will monitor the
 stack and allocate more if it are about to run out.


 See also  List of events                      
           Orientating yourself in the project 


List of events

 All events in Recall will appear in  this  listview and the events will be
 shown in priority from top to bottom.

 The list may contain folders  which  are  not  'real' events, but rather a
 group of one or more events of the  same  type and they can be accessed by
 doubleclicking on the folder name.

 NOTE  That the update will be  rather  slow when doubleclicking on folders
       and all the windows (Event,  Text,  Dates  and Attributes) are open.
       This is NOT a  bug  in  Recall!   Unfortunately, gadtools isn't very
       fast...


 See also  Adding events  
           Adding folders 


Renaming events

 You can change the name of the  event  any  time by selecting the event in
 the listview and alter the name in the stringgadget below the listview.


Making a folder

 Pressing 'Makedir' will  activate  the  stringgadget  below  the listview,
 allowing you to enter the name  of  the new folder.  The stringgadget will
 already contain the characters '>> '  indicating that is a directory.  The
 length of the name is limited to 255 characters.

 The name you enter, will only be  added  to  the list if you press return.
 Failing to do so, will cancel the creation of the new directory.  Pressing
 return will add the new folder  at  the  bottom of the list.  The listview
 will automatically scroll the list to show the new folder.

 The implementation of folders allows you to  group events of the same type
 together.  This results is a  much  more  surveyable project.  For example
 could all birthday events profitably be  positioned inside a folder called
 'Birthdays'.

 Since a folder is not an  event  in  itself,  you  will not be able to add
 text, date to it or change the attributes.

 The number of levels of folders are only limited to your available memory.


 See also  Recursive folders 


Orientating yourself in the project

 Anyone familiar with directory utilities  like DirectoryOpus, DirMaster or
 such will recognize Recall's method of handling folders.

 Doubleclicking on a directory in the list  of events will make that folder
 the active one.

 The Root button will bring you to the first level.

 The Parent  button  will  bring  you  to the previous
 level.


 See also  Recursive folders 


Saving the project and quitting

 When clicking on Save, Recall saves  the current project under the default
 name and exits.

 The project can be saved without  exiting, by selecting Project->Save from
 the Project menu.  If you want to  save the project under a different name
 you can achieve this by selecting Project->Save as...

 If Recall is resident in memory when you save your project, Recall will be
 notified and load the new project.


 See also  Project menu 
           Cancel       


Testing a project

 When creating a new project of  events,  there  is sometimes a wish to try
 things out before saving to disk.  This can be achieved by clicking on the
 Test-gadget or by selecting the menu-item Project->Test.

 When selected, Recall Preferences  will  start  Recall  and go through the
 list of events and  display  them  according  to their attributes.  Recall
 must be available in the same directory as Recall Preferences.


 See also  Project->Test 


Cancel all changes and quit

 Clicking on the Cancel-gadget will terminate the program without question,
 unless the Settings->Acknowledge? menu-item is  checked.  All changes done
 to the project will be lost.


 See also  Settings->Acknowledge 
           Save                  


Text window

 An event would be of much  use  if  it  didn't contain some data.  In this
 window you describe what the event should display or do.

           Attributes window 


Adding text to an event

 Pressing 'New' in the text window will activate the stringgadget below the
 listview, allowing you to  enter  the  text.   The  length  of the name is
 limited to 255 characters.  Although the length  of text can be as much as
 255 character, you should keep  in  mind  that  alerts and requesters on a
 standard 640 pixels wide screen are limited to a width of 77 characters.

 The text you enter, will only be  added  to  the list if you press return.
 Failing to do so, will cancel the operation.  Pressing return will add the
 text at the bottom of  the  list.   The listview will automatically scroll
 the list to show the new text.

 The number of  texts  attached  to  one  event  are  only  limited by your
 available memory.

Selecting a command from a filerequester

 Instead of typing in the programs you want to execute from Recall, you can
 simply click on  the  GetFile-gadget  to  the  left  of  the stringgadget.
 Clicking this button will bring up a filerequester, allowing you to select
 the command you want to run.  The name of the selected file will be copied
 to the stringgadget and the cursor  will  be  positioned at the end of the
 string, allowing you to enter any parameters.

 This button will only be available if  the  type of event is set to either
 CLI, WB or AREXX.


 See also  Setting the type of an event 


Inserting fields

 One of the  most  powerful  features  of  Recall,  is  that it understands
 certain fields inside the text.   These  fields  will be calculated during
 the execution of a  project  and  the  resulting  value  will be displayed
 instead of the date field.

 The format of the date  field  is {<calculate:>DD/MM/YYYY} for calculation
 fields and {<display>} for display fields,  and  MUST  be  exactly in that

 format!  Notice the bracket parenthesis surrounding  the date field - they
 can not be omitted!

 To simplify the process of inserting fields, these fields can be selected,
 and automatically inserted  at  the  cursor-position,  from  a listview by
 pressing the pop up gadget to the right of the stringgadget.

 There is no limit to the number of  fields one line can contain as long as
 the number of characters does not exceed 255.

 Some examples to demonstrate its power:

 "I will be {years:08/05/1970} years in {days:08/05/1970} days"
 may be displayed as
 "I will be 24 years in 7 days".

 "Time left to my date with Cindy: {timelapse:31/12/1995 15:30}"
 may be displayed as
 "Time left to my date with Cindy: 03:15".

 "{minutes:31/11/1994 00:00} minutes left to midnight"
 may be displayed as:
 "7 minutes left to midnight"

 "Today: {weekday}, {date} {time}"
 may be displayed as
 "Today: Sunday, 1.May.94 13:34:23"

 "Maxiplan Account_{month}.exc"
 may be executed as
 "Maxiplan Account_5.exc"

Date window

 The calendar allows the user to enter the date of the event in a very easy
 and intuitive way.  Near the top of  the calendar is a display gadget that
 shows the  selected  date.   When  a  component  of  the  date  is  of  no
 importance, it will be displayed as  two  or more '*', meaning the current
 day/month/year/hour/minute.

Creating a new date

 Recall allows dates to be attached  to  an  event.  The event will only be
 shown when the date occur.

 The number of dates attached to  the  same  event are only limited by your
 available memory.



Setting the day

 To set the day of an event,  simply  click  on one the numbered gadgets in
 the calendar-window.  The selected day  will  be highlighted and displayed
 in the date field.  If you  want  the  event  to appear on any day, please
 select the gadget '**' meaning any  day.   '**' will always be replaced by
 the current day.

 NOTE: It is of no use setting the date  to Before or After day ** since **
       will be replaced by the current day.


 See also  Setting the month 
           Setting the year  


Setting the month

 The month is  set  by  cycling  through  the  month-cyclegadget  until the
 desired month is activated.  If you want  the event to appear every month,
 please select the item 'Any month'.

 NOTE: It is of no use setting the  date  to Before or After month ** since
       ** will be replaced by the current month.


 See also  Setting the day  
           Setting the year 


Setting the year

 The year of the event  is  set  by  entering   the  desired  year  in  the
 integer-gadget  next  to  the  month-cyclegadget.   If  you want the event
 to  appear every year, enter a zero or nothing.

 Entering  a  number of length less than  four, will cause the event to  be
 displayed each year the given year  match with the current year.  In other
 words, entering year='3'  (displayed  as  '***3')  will  display the event
 every year that ends with '3'.

 NOTE: It is of no use setting the date  to Before or After year **** since
       **** will be replaced by the  current  year, and thus the event will
       never be displayed.

 NOTE: Acceptable values are from 1978 to 2099.

 See also  Setting the day   
           Setting the month 


Setting the period for a date or time

 It is sometimes desirable to display  an  event  n  days before or after a
 specified date or n minutes before or after a specified hour.

 Recall allows the user to  set   the  interval of days or minutes, and the
 event will only be displayed during that interval.

 This gadget becomes available  only  when  the  date  is  set to Before or
 After.


 See also  Setting the repeat value for a date 
           Examples                            


Setting the repeat value for a date or time

 It is sometimes desirable to display  events at repeating intervals.  This
 can be achieved by entering the desirable minute-interval in this gadget.

 This gadget becomes available only  when  the  prefix  is set to Before or
 After.

 Another way of making a repeating  event,  is  of course by setting one or
 more of the components to a zero (indicated by '**' in the display).


 See also  Setting the period for a date 
           Examples                      


Setting the weekdays

 Events may pop up on certain  weekdays.   If  no weekdays are checked, the
 event will pop up every day  of  the  week  (whenever the date matches the
 current date).  Whenever an item is checked, the event will pop up on that
 weekday ONLY.

 Examples:
 After 23/10/1994, Monday and Friday checked:
 The event will appear after 23/10/1994 every monday and friday.


 NOTE: Checking weekdays when the date is full (i.e. when no item is set to
       '**' and  set  to  EXACT),  will  probably  prevent  the  event from
       showing.

 NOTE: Checking all weekdays equals checking none.


 See also  Examples 


Setting the time of an event

 Setting the time is just as  simple   as   setting the time in Commodore's
 Time Preferences.  Just  drag  the  sliders  to  the  desired  level.  The
 selected hour and minutes will be  shown  in the main window.  Setting any
 of the sliders to  the  bottom  level  will  replace  its value with '**',
 meaning that it will be replaced by  the  current time when the project is
 run.

 NOTE: It is of no use  setting  the  time  to  Before or After **:** since
       **:** will be replaced by the current time.

 NOTE: That Recall isn't  synchronized  with  the  internal  clock  of your
       Amiga.  An event that should be shown exactly 13:00 might as well be
       shown on 13:00:59 if you  started  Recall 12:00:59 (Recall will just
       be idle the requested time (set by the WAIT tooltype)).


 See also  Tuning the date and time 
           Examples 


Tuning the date and time

 It may be times when you do  not  want  the events to appear on a specific
 date or time, but rather before or  after.  This can easily be achieved by
 adjusting the cycle-gadgets at the  top  of  both date- and time-groups in
 the calendar.  The default value is 'Exact'.

 Exact
 The event will appear ONLY at the given  date or time.  If you do not turn
 your machine on that day, you will never see the event!

 Before
 The event will appear only BEFORE  and  EXACT  the given date or time.  If
 the selected date is '07.**.1993', the  event  will  appear on the first 7
 days every month during 1993.  If the  selected time is '11:00', the event
 will appear between '00:00' and (not including) '11:00'.

 After
 The event will appear only  AFTER  and  EXACT  the given date or time.  If
 the selected date is '07.06.1993',  the  event  will appear every day from
 '07.06.1993' to eternity.  If the selected time is '11:00', the event will
 appear between '11:01' and (including) '23:59'.

Grouping events

 Events of the same type may be  grouped together and displayed in the same
 requester or alert.  Executable events will  still launch its programs one
 after the other (unless all executables  have the Multitask-flag set), but
 if Confirm is checked, you may acknowledge the whole group as one.

 Currently,  Requester  and  Alert  events  only  uses  the  first  event's
 attributes when grouped.  So if  the  first  event  is to be confirmed all
 events grouped together with this  event  will  also have to be confirmed.
 If you do not want this to happen, don't check the Group-button.

Flashing the screen

 Important events sometimes need to be call  the attention of the user with
 something extra, and by checking  this  checkbutton, Recall will flash the
 screen and signal with a beep (V38+) before displaying the event.


Confirming events

 If Confirm is checked, Recall will  add  an extra button to all requesters
 (including confirm-requesters for  executables)  allowing  you  cancel the
 event for the rest of the day.


Postponing events

 If Postpone is checked, Recall will add  an extra button to all requesters
 (including confirm-requesters for  executables)  allowing  you to postpone
 the displayed event or events if grouped.

 Postpone is very  useful  with  daily  events.   Pressing  Postpone in the
 requester will put off the event  until  the next checking of the project.
 In other words, it will keep  nagging  you until you acknowledge or cancel
 it.

 Here's a little example:
 Let's say a message pops up asking you if it should run the backup utility
 because it is 60 days  since  you  last  took  a  backup of you harddrive.
 Let's just assume that you haven't  got  time  to do the backup right now.
 If you press Cancel, Recall  will  cancel  that  event  and not display it
 before another 60 days have passed.   Pressing Postpone on the other hand,
 will just put it off until the next time Recall checks the project.


Multitasking launched binaries

 If Multitask is checked,  Recall  will  launch  all  started programs as a
 separate task and immediate continue with the next event in the project.

 If this item is not  checked,  Recall  will  kindly  wait for the executed
 program to exit before continuing with next event in the project.

 NOTE
 Currently AREXX  commands  are  not  sent  asynchronously.   The multitask
 switch applies to CLI and WB events only


Centring requesters

 Checking Centre will force all  ReqTools  requesters  to be centred on the
 screen.

 The state of this checkbutton will  be ignored if the tooltype USEREQTOOLS
 is FALSE or NO.

           Running the programs         


Selecting the type of event

 In what way an event will  appear,  is  determined by which type is chosen
 for that event.  Currently these modes are available:

 Requester
 All texts will be  displayed  in  a  standard requester with an OK-button.
 The maximum number of  lines  which  may  be  displayed is only limited by
 the screens resolution and font.   The requester will automatically adjust
 to the font used by your system.   The requester will have more buttons if
 either Postpone or Confirm is checked.


 Yellow alert
 All texts will be displayed using  a standard RECOVERY (yellow) alert. The
 alert will be opened on a  640*200  screen  on a NTSC-machine or a 640*256
 screen on a PAL-machine.    The   font  used  will  always be Topaz8.  The
 frame of the alert will  be  automatically  adjusted  to fit the number of
 lines  shown  and  all  lines  will  be centred.

 Press either  left  or  right  mousebutton  to  continue.   If  Confirm is
 checked, the alert  will  contain  a  line  at  the  bottom  of  the alert
 announcing that pressing the left  mousebutton  will continue and pressing
 the right mousebutton will cancel the event.


 Red alert
 As 'Yellow alert' but all  texts  will  be  displayed  in a DEADEND  (red)
 alert instead of a RECOVERY alert.  Useful for VERY important events.


 CLI
 All text-lines will be run as if  they  were  typed in a Shell window.  If
 several programs is requested, they   will   be   run  after each other in
 priority from top to bottom.

 Running larger batch-programs can  be   done   easily by entering "execute

 <filename>".  Recall also  accepts  remarks   and   'execute  <filename> ;
 remark' will work without problems.


 WB
 All text-lines will be launched like  programs from Workbench.  This means
 that the programs may take advantage of any data in their icons.  Use this
 whenever you start a program that has an icon.


 AREXX
 All text-lines will  be  launched  as  AREXX-scripts.   That  way  you may
 control other applications directly from Recall.


 Input
 Probably the most powerful of all  Recall  event-types.  Each of the text-
 lines will sent to the input  stream  as one event (with qualifiers).  The
 possibilities is unlimited.  May  also  be  used  to  pop up programs that
 react to certain hotkeys or execute macros etc.

           Describing input events 


Describing input events

 Input events must follow a  certain  syntax  or  else an enforcer-hit will
 occur:

 [<Class>] {[-][<Qualifier>]} [-][upstroke] [<Keycode>]

 All keywords are case insensitive.

 Classes
 This parameter is optional and  if  missing  the default `rawkey' is used.
 Currently these classes are defined:

 rawkey        This is the default  class  and  covers all keyboard events.
               For example `rawkey a' or `a' will  send an 'a' to the input
               stream (equal to the user pressing an 'a'). You must specify
               a keycode for this class.

 rawmouse      This class  describes  all  mouse  button  events.  You must
               specify a keycode for this class.

 diskinserted  Events of this class are  generated  when a disk is inserted
               in a drive.  This class has no keycodes.

 diskremoved   Events of this class are  generated  when  a disk is removed
               from a drive.  This class has no keycodes.


 Qualifier
 Qualifiers are 'signals' that  must  be  set  or  cleared  by the time the
 hotkey is activated.  For each qualifier  that  must be set you supply its
 keyword.  All other qualifiers are expected  to  be cleared by default. If
 you want to ignore a qualifier,  just  set  a `-' before its keyword.  The
 qualifiers inside parenthesis  are  only  available  on  kickstart V38 and
 higher.

 lshift, [left_shift]            Left shift-key

 rshift, [right_shift]           Right shift-key

 shift                           Either shift-keys

 capslock, [caps_lock]           Caps lock key
 caps                            Either shift key or caps lock key

 control, [ctrl]                 Control key

 lalt, [left_alt]                Left alt key
 ralt, [right_alt]               Right alt key
 alt                             Either alt key

 lcommand, [lamiga],
 [left_amiga], [left_command]    Left Amiga/Command key

 rcommand, [ramiga],
 [right_amiga], right_command]   Right Amiga/Command key

 numericpad, [numpad],
 num_pad], [numeric_pad]         This keyword must be  used  for any key on
                                 the numeric pad
 leftbutton, [lbutton],
 [left_button]                   Left mouse button

 midbutton, [mbutton],
 [middlebutton], [middle_button] Middle mouse button

 rbutton, [rightbutton],
 [right_button]                  Right mouse button

 repeat                          This qualifier is  set  when  the keyboard
                                 repeat is  active.  Only  useful  for  the
                                 'rawkey' class.

 Note: Commodities V37 has a bug  which  prevents  the use of `leftbutton',
       `midbutton' and `rbutton' as qualifiers. This bug is fixed in V38.


 upstroke
 Normally a hotkey event is generated when  a key is pressed.  If the event
 should  be  generated  when  the  key  is  released,  supply  the  keyword
 `upstroke'.  When both press and  release  of  the  key should generate an
 event, use `-upstroke'.


 Keycodes
 Each InputEvent class has its own keycodes.  The keycodes inside parenthe-
 sis are only available on kickstart V38 and higher.

 rawkey:   a-z, 0-9, ...           ASCII characters

           f1, f2,   ...           Function keys

           up, [cursor_up']
           down, [cursor_down]
           left, [cursor_left]
           right, [cursor_right]   Cursor keys

           esc, [escape],
           backspace, del, help
           tab, comma, return
           space, [spacebar]       Special keys.

           enter
           [insert], [delete]
           [page_up], [page_down]
           [home], [end]           Numeric Pad  keys.  Each  of  these  key
                                   codes must be used with the `numericpad'
                                   qualifier keyword!


 rawmouse  mouse_leftpress         Left mouse button.
           mouse_middlepress       Middle mouse button.
           mouse_rightpress        Right mouse button.

           Note: To use one of  these  key  codes,  you  must  also set the

                 corresponding qualifier keyword,  e.g. rawmouse leftbutton
                 mouse_leftpress

 Here are some examples to clarify:

 'alt t'   Will pop up a program that respond to the 'alt t' hotkey.

 'shift K'
 'e'
 't'
 'i'
 'l'       Will paste the word 'Ketil'  into an active shell, stringgadget,
           texteditor or whatever.

 NOTE:     Only one input event per line  is allowed.  Recall will generate
           an enforcer-hit otherwise.

 WARNING:  Using ASCII codes in input events  may be dangerous, as they can
           trigger short-cuts for buttons,  mess  up  text  in a texteditor
           etc.  Use at your own risk!


Selecting how often the event will be displayed

 Recall uses two methods to determine wether an event will be shown or not.
 First it checks the state of  the Show-cyclegadget, then it excludes those
 events that don't match the current date and time.

 These are the states of the Show-cyclegadget:

 Startup
 The event will be shown only the first time Recall checks the project.

 Always
 The event will be displayed  every  time  Recall  checks the project.  How
 often this is, depends on  the  settings.   If  the checker is resident in
 memory, that may be once every minute  (the idle time may be changed using
 tooltypes).  Avoid using this mode when  the  checker is made resident, as
 this would certainly increase Recall CPU  usage  as the event would pop up
 every minute.

 Daily
 The event will only be run the first time Recall is run that day, in other
 words; only once a day.

 Never
 The event will never  be  displayed.   Useful  if  you want to temporarily
 prevent an event of being displayed.


 See also  Setting the tooltypes 


Selecting a screen

 Allows the user  to  set  the  name  of  the  public  screen  on which the
 requester will appear.  You may either type  in the name or press the pop-
 up gadget and select among the current public screens that are open.

 If the requested screen does not  exist,  Recall will pop up the requester
 on the default public screen.

 NOTE: Even if some screens are public and  appear in the public list, some
       may be public  in  a  'private'  manner  and  thus Recall requesters
       cannot be displayed on that screen.

 The screen is only  used  for  determine  on  which  screen the requesters
 should appear.


Selecting a directory

 Allows the user to set  the  program's  current directory.  You may either
 type in the directory  yourself,  or  press  the  getdir-gadget  and use a
 filerequester to select a directory.

 The directory is only used when starting CLI or Workbench programs.


Setting the stack of an executable

 Allows the user set the stack size  of  the program started by Recall.  If
 the program is started as a Workbench  task,  Recall will use the stack in
 the program's icon if it is larger than the one requested.

 The stack is only used when starting CLI or Workbench programs.


Setting the priority of an executed program

 Allows the user to set the priority of the program started by Recall.

 The priority is only used when starting CLI or Workbench programs.


Setting the timeout period for alerts

 Allows the user to set length of  time  the alert should wait for the user
 to respond.  This time is  the  number  of  video  frames the alert should
 remain up for.  Setting the timeout-value  has  no effect on machines with
 kickstart lower than 39.

 This switch can be very useful for machines  that run a BBS and that needs
 to go on with their script if the user doesn't reply.

 NOTE
 The timeout value is only used for Yellow and Red alerts.

Future developments and plans

 Implementations to do:


 - AREXX control for both Recall Preferences, allowing external control and
   macro creation.

 - Replace text routine

 - LOGFILE=<filename> tooltype to keep a log  over events showed by Recall.
   Nice if you run a BBS or something and want to keep track of what Recall
   has done.

 - A catch-up feature, so no events are missed.

 - Startup-drawer where you can put  the  modules you automatically want to
   run when Recall Preferences is started.

 - Paste text should filter out unknown characters (tab/eol/lf).

 - Paste text should create  more  lines  if  the clipboard buffer contains
   more than one line.

 - Hooks that let you control the listview through the stringgadgets.

 - AM/PM time in countries that use such format (TOOLTYPE)

 - Default to Topaz80 when a window is too big for the screen.

 - Better search-routine.  Should jump recursively backwards as well.

 - HELP menu listing the important topics.


 Modules:

 - Print export module.

 - Almanac/Filofax module.

 - Export module: Generate a list containing  the  text of all events (with
   calculation fields replaced by their values). (Suggested by Per Sverre
   Vogt-Hansen)

 - Module that let you alter the inner  flags  of  an event (if an event is
   cancelled you may 'un-cancel' it...).

 - Match module.  Display all events that match given data.


Troubleshooting, Tips & Tricks

 
 The event does not show even if the date and time is set right
 Try setting 'Show' to 'Always' and  try  again.  The event might have been
 run earlier that day...   If  you  cycle  through  the Show-gadget, Recall
 Preferences will reset the daily flag.

 The event will not execute!
 Recall needs the full path!  If  you  for example use the Say-command, you
 must enter "SYS:Utilities/say" or else it will not be able to find it.

 How do I make an annual event?
 Set the date of the event to   DD.MM.****,  where DD and MM represents the
 day and the month you want  the   event   to  pop up.  Setting the year to
 **** is the same as saying 'every  year'  and **** will be replaced by the
 current year.

 How do I make a birthday event?
 There is unlimited number of   ways   to enter a birthday-event, depending
 of how you want the event to be shown.  Here's one suggestion.
 (Problem: Remind me of Rebecca's birthday on 08.05.1970)
 Set the date to 'Before', '08.05.****'
 Set the time to 'After', '11:00'
 Days='3'
 Repeat='0'
 Text='Rebecca is {years:08/05/1970} on 8th of May'
 Show='Daily'

 This event will be displayed daily on the 6th, 7th and 8th of May, leaving
 enough time to buy her a  flower  or  whatever... (...am I getting soft or
 what ;).

 Testing an event with Show set to 'Daily'
 When testing such a project the event  will  ALWAYS be shown if it has not
 been displayed that day.  Furthermore will  it  not show if it already has
 been displayed that day.  This is  inevitable, since Recall Preferences do
 not alter the project's private structure.
 
 How to make events appear x days BEFORE and y days AFTER a date?
 If you want an event to be displayed 3 days before the 10.10.93 AND 2 days
 AFTER, you must simply set the date to BEFORE 16.10.93 and days to 5!
 
 When I try to execute a program from Recall it crashes!
 When running Recall  from  the  WBStartup-drawer,  some   programs seem to
 cause an out of memory-guru.  This is  not   a bug in Recall!  I have only
 discovered this  error  while   running   ToolManager  from  WBStartup and
 Maxiplan V4.09 (started as an   event   within Recall) while running under
 WB3.0. Other programs  might  cause  similar  problems.  The   solution is
 however,  quite simple; enter 'Wait 2' on the line above your program, and
 your program will work just fine.

 How do I play a tune while displaying an event?
 You have to create two events to  do  a  thing like that (or by creating a
 little batch-file to execute).  The  first  event must be of execute-type:
 "run >NIL: play birthday.mod".   The  second  event  must  be of alert- or
 requester-type with the desired text.  The dates of the two events must of
 course be the same.
 
 How do I display events before the first of a month?
 If you want the event to be  shown  x  days before the 1st of every month,
 set it up like this: n-1 days  before  the  last  day in the month or i.e.
 after 25th.

History

 The Recall version follows the notation <version>.<revision>, meaning that
 V3.10 is greater than V3.1.  The current  version can be printed out using
 'Version full Recall'  or  by  selecting  About  from  the Project-menu in
 Recall Preferences.

 In the early days
 This program actually started out as a small AREXX script, size 883 bytes!
 You might say that this project has grown significantly since then ;)

 24.May.93 V1.0
 First released version.

 25.May.93 V1.1
 RecallPrefs used to crash when   it   loaded  an  old project and the user
 selected 'Use'.  Now fixed.

 29.May.93 V1.2
 RecallPrefs now  tries  to  open  its  window  using  the current font set
 by  the  user.   If  this  fails  (usually  when  the window  becomes  too
 big  for   the   screen),  it  settles  for  the   standard   Topaz8-font.
 RecallPrefs now uses NewLook-style in menus.

 04.Jun.93 V1.3
 Recall now only updates  the   project  when  it's  absolutely necessary .
 This saves a lot of disk-access.  Fixed  a  bug in the compare date & time
 header  file.  Fixed a bug in the  purge-function  which  removed   events
 with  empty dates...  Updating  the   attributes   of   the   event is now
 speeded     up.      RecallPrefs       disables      the     corresponding
 (Exact/Before/After)-cyclebutton  if  Datestring      or  Timestring   are
 empty.    Made   more compliant with Commodore's Style Guide.

 08.Jun.93 V1.4
 Oooooops, made a  MAJOR  mistake   by   releasing   V1.3 too soon!  In the
 last minute a minor bug was fixed, and  this resulted of course in a MAJOR
 bug at another location in the program! Selecting 'Before' or 'After' with
 dates did not work at  all...  nor  did  #  Days  or  Repeat every #...  I
 PROMISE to check more   thoroughly   in  the  future...   When testing the
 project from  RecallPrefs,  the program asked  for a assign called 'REC:'.
 Now removed...  Recall  must  be   located    in    your   working   path.
 (i.e.  >path work:recall).  Fixed  a  bug   which   resulted  in a ghosted
 textstring  when editing a line of text...

 30.Oct.93 V1.5
 Fixed a bug which caused  Recall  to  return  a returncode and generate an
 error when testing a project from 'Recall Preferences'.  Now fixed.

 08.Nov.93 V1.6
 Fixed two  tiny  bugs  which  caused  Enforcer  hits.   Since  they  where
 positioned in the main loop of  both 'Recall Preferences' and Recall, hits
 appeared on every GADGETUP  IDCMP  and  event.   Now  fixed.  (Reported by
 Henning Schmiedehausen).  Selecting the GetFile  gadget  when no event was
 selected also caused an Enforcer hit.  Now fixed.  The Add Text gadget was
 sometimes not disabled, making it possible  to  add text to a non-existing
 event.  Now fixed.  Added an extra menu item to save project under default
 name without terminating  the  program.   (Suggested  by Raoul Rodriguez).
 Also, the new archive is  better  organized  with drawers for preferences,
 install and documentation.  The Installer-script  has been rewritten.  The
 documentation has been processed once  again, making (hopefully) easier to
 read (all chapter has a right justified margin...).

 12.Nov.93 V1.7
 The two binaries is now reduced in  size.  The sources may now be compiled
 by double-clicking on the  Build-icon  in  the  Source drawer.  Added more
 tips to 'Troubleshooting'.  The installer-script  is made more generic and
 will also detect if the user already has a Recall project and rename it to
 'Recall_OLD.prefs' when installing new example project. Also   reorganized
 the .guide, so that the chapters  appear  in  the same order as when using
 browse.  Corrected a few mistakes  and  misspellings in the documentation.
 Fixed a bug which caused repeating  events   not to be displayed when they
 should.  Also, when counting days  between  different months and years did
 not come out right.  Now fixed.   (thanks to Juha Kallioinen for questions
 about weekly events, which led me into finding this bug!)

 16.Nov.93 V2.0
 This version  is  re-written  from  scratch.  Uses  MUImaster.library  for
 creating  a great looking  GUI.   Font-adaptable  window.  Sizable window.
 Short-cuts for  most  functions.   IFF-FORM  .prefs-file.   Possibility to
 group  events, flash screen  before  event, automatically  delete  expired
 events, acknowledging events alerts.   Confirm   actions  in  Preferences.
 Setting the date and  time   from  a  'calendar'.  Possibility to copy and
 sort lines of text.   Better   readability   and  better organized .guide.
 Documentation also included in ASCII-format.  Unstall-script to delete the
 Recall package on  your  harddisk.   Importing  and  exporting projects of
 different formats (may be  controlled  via  the  Preferences).  More show-
 options.  More date fields in the  same line.  Do not use reqtools.library
 if not requested.  The program  may be iconified.  On-line-HELP.  Although
 Recall has gained a lot  of  functions,  it  is  actually smaller in size!
 Optimized code if a faster CPU is available.  Much more...

 07.Dec.93 V2.1
 NEW All  binaries  and  the  installation-script  is  localized.  English,
     french, spanish, german, swedish and norwegian catalogs are included.
 NEW Speeded up Recall 30%!!!
 NEW All binaries has reduced in size!  Rewritten to use tiny ROM-routines!
 NEW Postponing events!  If you put off an  event, it will keep nagging you
     until you acknowledge it!
 NEW Updating event's attributes is now speeded up (a lot!) in Preferences.
 NEW Safer IFF-saving.
 NEW Settings menu-item: Confirm executables?
 NEW Recall requesters now state the  current  date  in their titles.  Uses
     the selected dateformat.
 NEW Recall uses less memory than before!
 NEW Rearranged the GUI a little:  The date and time are separated from the
     text-group, the getfile-gadget now  uses  the button-background set in
     MUIprefs.
 NEW The  day-of-the-month  gadgets  are  now   of  BOOL  type  (like  Time
     Preferences).
 NEW The calendar can now be controlled from the keyboard.
 FIX Events with x days BEFORE  or  AFTER  were  not displayed (Reported by
     Dirk Böhmer).
 FIX Acknowledging alerts did not  work,  unless  'Acknowledge events?' was
     NOT checked.  This  bug  did  not  appear  when  the  binaries was not
     optimized by the compiler... Strange...
 FIX The GUI of the installation-script was  messy  if  you did not use the
     Topaz.font (Reported by Heikki Kantola).
 FIX The GetFile-gadget did not work! (Reported by Olav Müller).
 FIX GetFile did not allocate it's memory properly.
 FIX The GetFile-gadget was not documented.
 FIX Purging did not remove all the events that it should.
 FIX Corrected several bugs regarding  ghosted  buttons  and  the update of
     attributes.
 FIX One node in  the  documentation  of  Recall  was  not linked properly.
     (Reported by Olav Müller).
 FIX Recall and Recall Preferences did not  deallocate all used memory when
     terminating.
 FIX Recall crashed if Use ReqTools? was checked but not available!
 FIX Events set to whenever or anytime did  not show if BEFORE or AFTER was
     selected.
 FIX The stringgadgets do no  longer  get  activated  when  selecting a new
     event/text from the listviews, making  it  easier  to use the keyboard
     short-cuts.
 FIX Recall Prefs no longer  asks  for  a  file  to  import  or export when
     SYS:Tools/ReConvert is not available...
 FIX Changed the name of some  items.   'Whenever' and 'Anytime' changed to
     'Every day' and  'All  day',  respectively.   'Once  a  day'  has been
     changed to 'Daily'.
 FIX Enforcer Hit when accidentally loading certain non Recall IFF-files.
 FIX All output to shell from Recall will  now be routed to the same shell-
     window!

 03.Mar.94 V2.2
 NEW Italiano catalogs included.
 NEW Nederlands catalogs included.
 NEW SBasePro 4 batch script for  converting  a  database of birthdays to a
     Recall project included.  Script provided by Thorsten Gau.
 NEW Recall only updates the project  when  the  user has selected a button
     which alters any of the internal flags.  Less disk-access.
 NEW The ASL requester now excludes the .info-files.
 FIX Recall now handles dates after 30. January 2000.
 FIX When displaying requesters with  only  one  button (no Cancel-button),
     pressing OK was interpreted as Cancel.
 FIX Events of type 'Execute' were only run once when 'Confirm executables'
     was not checked.
 FIX You could always cancel an  alert,  even  if the 'Confirm Alerts?' was
     not checked...
 FIX Prefs only allocates memory for the Asl-requester when needed.
 FIX Fixed a bug in  the  IFF  save-routine,  which  caused  a GURU on some
     machines.
 FIX Safer IFF-saving.
 FIX All binaries reduced in size (again).  The checker is now only 8Kb!
 FIX Recall used c-lib routines to get  and  calculate date and time.  This
     could be quite annoying when  running  SnoopDOS  in the background, as
     these  functions  access  ENV:TZ  a  lot.   Switched  to  ROM-routines
     instead.
 FIX Recall Preferences did not show events which printed texts to a shell-
     window when testing the project.
 FIX Recall Preferences would not update the  list  of texts when the first
     event in the list was highlighted, and user opened another project.
 FIX Corrected some mistakes and misleadings in the docs.

     The ReqTools.library will not be  included  from  V2.2  and later in a
     desperate try to reduce the size  of  the archive.  Anyway, 991f all
     Amiga-owners already have this library...

 28.Apr.94 V2.3
 NEW Suomi catalogs included.
 FIX Better Nederlands translation.  Now fits on a 640x200 screen.
 FIX Faster rendering of alerts.
 FIX Fixed a bug which caused Alerts to  crash on some machines.  Thanks to
     Olaf Seibert for suggesting the byte-split...
 FIX The Recall-documentation  contained  an  unknown  link.   Reported  by
     Philip Meyer.
 FIX The calendar crashed on some machines when using MUI V2.0.

     The source will not be included in  V2.3  and later in order to reduce
     the size of the  archive.  (Not  many  were  interested in the source,
     anyway...)

 V3.0  14.May.95
 NEW The checker  may  stay  resident  in  memory  (optional)  and  keep on
     reminding you until you quit  the  program  or  turn off your machine.
     Will check the  project  of  events  every  minute  (idle  time may be
     changed).  Uses very little CPU time.
 NEW The checker is a commodity, and  may be controlled via the Commodore's
     Commodities Exchange program.
 NEW Unlimited number of dates can be attached to the same event.
 NEW The calendar now takes weekdays in account.
 NEW You can combine weekdays and date,  allowing  you to make events which
     will be shown i.e. the third Sunday in a month etc.
 NEW The calendar will put each day on its right weekday in the calendar.
 NEW Possibility to set the period before or after a specified time.
 NEW Major update of the calculation  fields:  allowing you to include both
     the current date, current  time,  calculation  of days, calculation of
     years, current weekday and such in the  SAME event!  The fields can be
     selected and inserted from a requester.
 NEW LOTS of new fields types.
 NEW Tooltypes support.
 NEW Executed programs can be launched either  as Shell or Workbench tasks.
     Programs started in Workbench-mode will use tooltypes in their icons.

     keeping all birthday-events in  a  folder called Birthdays.  Unlimited
     number of levels!
 NEW Modular built.   Its  functionality  may  be  extended  with  modules.
     Modules included: Import  ASCII,  Recall  V1.x,  Recall  V2.x.  Export
     ASCII. Module that sorts events  by  date or alphabetically.  Browser-
     module for easy displaying all events.
 NEW Search and replace of event names.
 NEW Completely new graphic user interface.
 NEW Multi-window environment.  All windows are 'multitasking'.
 NEW No longer needs   MUI,  but  the  preferences  program  is still font-
     adaptable and sizeable.
 NEW ALL window-positions and sizes (including  the ASL requester), as well
     as font, screen, palette, etc. may be saved to disk.
 NEW Recall preferences will remember all  window  sizes and positions when
     exiting.
 NEW Recall can pop up requesters on any public screen.
 NEW Requesters may be forced to open on a certain public screen.

     need of RX.
 NEW Recall can  now  display  both  RECOVERY  (Yellow)  and  DEADEND (Red)
     alerts.

 NEW If Recall is resident in memory  and  the project is changed by Recall
     Preferences these changes will be detected and the new project will be
     loaded to memory.
 NEW Recall can now function as an alarm clock with snooze function.
 NEW ...lots more...


How to report bugs

 Keep these things in mind when you report bugs:

 o State the version of Recall you are using
 o State from where you received this software (PD disk, AmiNet, etc.)
 o State  you  configuration  (Kickstart,   WB,   special  tools  run  from
   WBStartup/Startup-Sequence, etc.)
 o Check that the  bugs  are  not  listed  in  'Known  bugs',  described in
   'Troubleshooting' or listed in 'Future developments and plans'.
 o Your list of bugs

 
 NOTE!   The size of the source-code is over 1 Megabyte so please keep your
         temper when reporting bugs.  It's  easy  for  bugs to slip through
         when the source get this long...   You use Recall entirely at your
         own risk!
