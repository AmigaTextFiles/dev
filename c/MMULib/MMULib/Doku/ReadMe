mmu.lib for vbcc
================

Created at 30.11.99 from MMU_Lib.FD (v 41.1)
also included the Disassembler_Lib and the
68040_lib/680x0_lib.

I have also included the lvo-files and the vbcc
autolib-.c-files. Please follow the instructions in the
vbcc doc for using the autolib function. The files
MuAutoLib_xxx.xxx are Autolibs for all four library's.

This libfiles can be used by vbcc and directly linked
to your programs.
To use the library under vbcc this files are recommended.
I don't know to with other compilers they are compatible.
It works correct by use of PhxLnk and vlink.

I generate the libs for myself with an own tool, the
project-make-manager (PMM) and so it is only one command
for me to create them.
I think, other users of vbcc can use them and must not do
same work.

I give this without copyright or anything else free to use
for everybody.

Used tools:
-----------
Stubs and lvo created from fd-file with FD2Lib, FD2LibPPC and
FD2LibWOS.
Stubs assembled with PhxAss and vasm.
.Lib generated with PmmLibr.
.a generated with ppc-amigaos-ar.
Autolib-files created with autolib.
