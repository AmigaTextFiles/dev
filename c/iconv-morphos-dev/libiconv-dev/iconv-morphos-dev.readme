This is MorphOS port of libiconv character set conversion library.
The port provides standard shared runtime library (iconv.library)
based on libiconv 1.11.

The archive contains libiconv.a in three flawours:

lib/libiconv.a
libb32/libiconv.a (libnix)
ixemul/libiconv.a


 [Installing]


Use Install.MorphOS script for GCC and VBCC install.

(VBCC install assumes you are using a VBCC: assign.)


 [Using iconv.library in your programs]


To use iconv.library you must have

#include <iconv.h>

and link against libiconv.a (-liconv).

Optionally you can just use inlines:

#include <proto/iconv.h>

This is little faster but not recommended for ports.


 [Building library]


Run make and wait.
