About this archive:
===================

VBCC has a nice feature ("vbrowse") that allows the usage of a SAS/C Message Browser-like
frontend. Once started, it catches messages that might occur during vbcc compiling
process and displays them, featuring error explanations and the option to click on 
them in order to open an editor and jump to error lines.

Installation:
=============
1. Simply unpack the archive and copy the contents of vbrowse/S to your S: directory. 
   Make sure that the "script" protection bit is set for both 'startvc' and 'vcompile'.
2: If not using GoldEd/Cubic as your editor, adjust s:startvc to your needs.

Usage:
======
1. Open a Shell. Type "startvc" + <Enter> - this sets up the environment.
2. Compile your source: vc +aos68k -o <your_exe> <your_source.c>
   You may also use the provided 'vcompile' script in order to do the job:
   vcompile <your_source> (without the .c suffix!) - this produces the
   executable <your_exe>_vc.
3. If any messages or errors occur, double-click on them in order to
   display error explanations or open an editor and jump to the error line.
