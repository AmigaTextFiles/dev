@NODE nodorkchecazze "What's this?"

Dorkalize is a utility that takes C source files and adds support for AmigaOS
localization by replacing the strings contained in them with calls to the
appropriate OS functions, allows input and editing of their translations,
generates the catalog descriptor files used by CatComp to create catalogs, and
then spawns CatComp itself to create the catalogs. This allows you to program
without cluttering your sources with calls which make them much less readable.

Unlike other programs of the same type, Dorkalize allows you to perform further
development of your program on the original sources, without having to deal
with the clumsy defines and/or function calls which replace printable strings.
Dorkalize will keep track of the modifications you had made to your sources and
will recover the localized strings and their translations from the previous
version. At every new version, you only have to select which strings of the new
ones you entered you want to be localized, enter their translations, and
compile the localized sources. Dorkalize will do all the rest, up to creating
the catalog.

This program was started to be a replacement for the buggy parsing function of
Commodore's "Localize" program, which is used to localize C source programs. At
least for us, it has never worked. It has then turned into a powerful utility
featuring advanced string filtering, automatic patching of source files,
built-in editing and translation of strings, recovery of translated strings
from older catalog descriptors, and spawning of CatComp.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkperche "Why this?"

Because when we tried to localize our Italian lotto program AmiSuperLotto we
discovered, much to our disappointment, that Localize did not work correctly.
Specifically, the line numbers to patch were incorrectly reported. In addition
to this, we wanted to develop a program to suit our needs (and maybe other
programmers') and allow for a quick translation of programs.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkdisclaimer "Disclaimer"

No warranty is given that Dorkalize will perform the expected task. We take no
responsibility for any kind of damage that Dorkalize can cause to its users.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkchevvo "Requirements"

Dorkalize requires any Amiga with at least OS 2.1 and MUI 3.0 or better, the
MUI custom classes NList.mcc and BetterString.mcc (included in the distribution
archive), and the Commodore localization tool CatComp. You may use Commodore's
Localize tool, but this is neither requested nor useful (since it contains more
than one bug). You can find CatComp and Localize in the 3.1 Native Developer
Kit.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkinstallazione "Installation"

To install or update Dorkalize simply double-click on the "Install" icon and
follow the prompts. You need the AmigaOS Installer to execute the installation
script.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkcomesefa "Quickstart for programmers"

If you are a programmer, you can use Dorkalize to generate, starting from your
nonlocalized sources, a version of the same sources that supports localization.

Note that your programs need some @{"modifications" link nodorkmodifichearcodice} you have to do by yourself
before they can be correctly localized.

When you start Dorkalize, you will be presented with the @{"main window" link nodorkprimafinestra}. The
first time you start Dorkalize you should set up all the @{"options" link nodorkopzioni}, in
particular you should tell Dorkalize where CatComp and, if you wish, Localize
are found. This is required to generate the C header file containing the
translation information, and the catalog files.

When you have set the global options, you should set the options for your
current project. Select the @{"Project options tab" link nodorktabopzioniproggetto} in the @{"main window" link nodorkprimafinestra} to set
them up. You should specify the following items:

- The descriptor file path and name. This is the .cd file that contains the
  strings to be localized and that will be used later to generate the catalogs.

- The path and name of the C header output file. This file will be
  automatically #included in the patched source files when needed. Make sure it
  resides in the same directory as your localized source files before compiling
  them.

- The working directory. Dorkalize will store the data needed for automatic
  string recovery here. Do not delete the .str file if you want to take
  advantage of this feature.

- The source directory for the translation files. If you have some old
  translation files (the files with a .ct extension used by CatComp) that you
  want to recover, put them in a subdirectory of the source directory that has
  the same name as the language they refer to. For example, if you have a
  previous .ct file containing the old Italian translations, and you specified
  "Dev:Workdir/" as source translation directory, you must put the file into
  "Dev:Workdir/italiano/". Dorkalize expects that the name of this file minus
  the .ct extension be the same as the name of the project minus the .dprj
  extension, if this is present.

- The destination directory for the translation and catalog files. Dorkalize
  will put the translation and catalog files it generates into subdirectories
  of this directory that have the same name as the languages the files refer to
  (see above). NOTE THAT IF YOU USE THE SAME DIRECTORY FOR SOURCE AND
  DESTINATION YOUR OLD TRANSLATIONS WILL BE OVERWRITTEN AND YOU WILL NOT BE
  ABLE TO RECOVER THEM IN CASE OF ERROR!

You can also choose a filter file from the @{"Filters tab" link nodorktabfiltri} to automatically
exclude some strings from the localization process. The filter window allows
you to edit filter files. A general-purpose filter file, dorkafilter.dflt,
containing patterns for strings which you usually don't want to localize, is
supplied with Dorkalize.

You should keep the default options for the tracking filter. This will allow
Dorkalize to recover the localization status of the old strings: if Dorkalize
had already patched those files, the strings you had decided not to localize
will be automatically put among those that will not be localized. A filter or
yourself can override this decision. If you do not want to take advantage of
the tracking filter, set the tracking depth to zero.

Finally, if you want to generate some of the translations yourself, you should
select which languages you want to generate translations for by adding them to
the list in the @{"languages tab" link nodorktablinguaggi}.

Now you can choose the files you want to localize in the @{"source files tab" link nodorktabfilesorgenti}.
After you have done so, press the button labeled "Dorkalize" to parse the
files.

Dorkalize will open the @{"string window" link nodorkfinestrastringhe}, which contains the strings which
survived the filtering process. To go on with the localization process, remove
the strings you don't want to translate selecting them and then pressing the
"Remove" button. You will find the strings you removed in the
@{"filtered string window" link nodorkfinestrastringhefiltrate}, which contains a list similar to the one above.
Double-click on any entry in this list to move it back to the initial list;
alternatively you can select some entries and move them back with the "Add
back" button.

At this point, you can patch your sources and generate the catalog descriptor
and C header file by pushing the "Patch sources" button. Each patched source
will be put into a subdirectory, called "Localized-source", of its original
path.

If at least one language has been selected, Dorkalize will proceed recovering
older translations from the source translation directory and opening the
@{"translated strings window" link nodorktraduzzione}. If you want to enter translations and generate
catalogs yourself, refer to the @{"quickstart for translators" link nodorkcomesetraduce} to learn how to do
that.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkcomesetraduce "Quickstart for translators"

If you are a translator, you can use Dorkalize to generate, starting from a
catalog descriptor supplied by the programmer, a catalog for each language of
your choice.

When you start Dorkalize, you will be presented with the @{"main window" link nodorkprimafinestra}. The
first time you start Dorkalize you should set up the @{"options" link nodorkopzioni}, in particular
you should tell Dorkalize where CatComp is found. This is required to generate
the catalog files.

When you have set the global options, you should set the options for your
current project. Select the @{"project options tab" link nodorktabopzioniproggetto} in the @{"main window" link nodorkprimafinestra} to set
them up. You should specify the following items:

- The descriptor file path and name. This is the .cd file that contains the
  strings to be localized and that will be used later to generate the catalogs.

- The source directory for the translation files. If you have some old
  translation files (the files with a .ct extension used by CatComp) that you
  want to recover, put them in a subdirectory of the source directory that has
  the same name as the language they refer to. For example, if you have a
  previous .ct file containing the old Italian translations, and you specified
  "Dev:Workdir/" as source translation directory, you must put the file into
  "Dev:Workdir/italiano/". Dorkalize expects that the name of this file minus
  the .ct extension be the same as the name of the project minus the .dprj
  extension, if this is present.

- The destination directory for the translation and catalog files. Dorkalize
  will put the translation and catalog files it generates into subdirectories
  of this directory that have the same name as the languages the files refer to
  (see above). NOTE THAT IF YOU USE THE SAME DIRECTORY FOR SOURCE AND
  DESTINATION YOUR OLD TRANSLATIONS WILL BE OVERWRITTEN AND YOU WILL NOT BE
  ABLE TO RECOVER THEM IN CASE OF ERROR!

Finally you should select which languages you want to generate translations for
by adding them to the list in the @{"languages tab" link nodorktablinguaggi}.

At this point you should save the project to avoid losing the settings when you
quit Dorkalize.

Now press the "Recover translations" key. Dorkalize will open the
@{"translated strings window" link nodorktraduzzione}. In the rightmost column of the list you can enter
the translations of the strings that appear in the central column. You can
select the language you are working upon using the cycle gadget. When you're
done you can choose to create the catalogs (Dorkalize will spawn CatComp
itself) for the language selected or for all at once. You can also choose to
create the translation files for CatComp and launch CatComp by yourself, if you
wish to.

Note that you cannot save your work except by creating the translations or
catalogs. In this case, the new strings will be in the .ct file found in the
destination translation directory. To recover them, press the "Recover new
translations" button in the @{"main window" link nodorkprimafinestra}.

See @{"generating catalogs" link nodorkfaercatalogo} to learn how to use the catalog descriptor to generate
catalogs without using Dorkalize.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkmodifichearcodice "Modifications to C source"

First, all the files that contain strings you want to localize must include the
C header that defines the pragmas for the locale.library; for example, for
SAS/C this is:

    #include  <proto/locale.h>

Then, one of your files (which will most often be the one which contains the
main() function) must include the locale.library definitions header:

    #include  <libraries/locale.h>

and must declare the catalog variable as global:

    struct Catalog  *catalog;

NOTE THAT YOU HAVE TO NAME THIS VARIABLE JUST "catalog", NOTHING ELSE; THIS IS
BECAUSE DORKALIZE WILL REFER TO IT WITH THIS NAME.

Then you have to open locale.library and the catalog itself; for example, the
Dorkalize code that performs these actions is:

    if (LocaleBase = OpenLibrary("locale.library", 38))
    {
        catalog = OpenCatalog(NULL, "dorkalize.catalog",
                              TAG_DONE);
    }

Finally, all the files that will be localized, except the one above, must
contain a reference to the catalog variable:

    extern struct Catalog  *catalog;
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkfaercatalogo "Using CatComp without Dorkalize"

You can use CatComp to generate a blank translation file from a catalog
descriptor with:

CatComp <catalog descriptor.cd> CTFILE=<blank translation file.ct>

You can refer to CatComp's guide for a full explanation of how to edit this to
get a translation file. Finally, use

CatComp <catalog descriptor.cd> <translation file.ct>
   CATALOG=<catalog file.catalog> CFILE=<header file.h>

to generate all the files you need.

Note that you need to include the generated header file in your source and
define the constants CATCOMP_NUMBERS and CATCOMP_STRINGS before compiling (at
least this is the method we use).
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkprimafinestra "Main window"

The main window contains a register with four tabs.

    @{" Source files tab " link nodorktabfilesorgenti}
    @{" Project options tab " link nodorktabopzioniproggetto}
    @{" Filters tab " link nodorktabfiltri}
    @{" Languages tab " link nodorktablinguaggi}

Under the register file are three buttons. The "Dorkalize" button starts the
parsing of the files and opens the @{"string window" link nodorkfinestrastringhe}. This is the only moment in
which filtering is applied. The "Recover translations" button attempts to
recover older translations, if present in the source translation directory
specified in the @{"project options tab" link nodorktabopzioniproggetto}, and then opens the
@{"translated strings window" link nodorktraduzzione}. The "Recover new translations" button performs the
same action, but on the new translations, if present in the destination
translation directory specified in the @{"project options tab" link nodorktabopzioniproggetto}.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorktabfilesorgenti "Source files tab"

The "Source files" tab contains the list of the source files to process. You
can add files entering their name in the string gadget below or selecting them
with the associated popup gadget (which supports multiple selection). You can
remove any source file from the list by double-clicking on it or selecting some
files and then pressing the "Remove" button below.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorktabopzioniproggetto "Project options tab"

The "Project options" tab contains:

- A checkmark labelled "Localize strings in defines". When selected, the
  strings found inside #define directives are by default localized, otherwise
  they are not. You can individually change this attribute for each one of them
  in the @{"string window" link nodorkfinestrastringhe}.

- A checkmark labelled "Use internal patcher". When selected, Dorkalize will
  patch the source files using its built-in patching routine, otherwise will
  invoke Localize. There is no real reason to uncheck it, unless you find a bug
  in the Dorkalize patcher (we found at least one in Localize, anyway), or you
  want to generate a catalog descriptor for each single file.

- A text gadget displaying the command line used to invoke Localize. You cannot
  alter its contents directly, but only acting upon the various options.

- A checkmark labelled "Merge catalogs". When selected it activates the
  MERGECATALOG option of Localize, which means that you will get only one
  catalog descriptor file for all of your source files. It is selected by
  default and should stay so unless you have any special requirements (e.g. the
  source files refer to more than one executable file). When selected, the
  descriptor file name is decided by the contents of the "Descriptor name"
  gadget.

- A string gadget and associated popup labelled "Descriptor name". If you
  checked the "Use internal patcher" checkmark or you selected the "Merge
  catalogs" option, you must insert here the path and name of the catalog
  descriptor (.cd) file you want to create.

- A string gadget and associated popup labelled "String output file". You must
  insert here the path and name of the patch file created by Dorkalize as an
  input to Localize.

- A string gadget and associated popup labelled "Working directory". Dorkalize
  will store the data needed for automatic string recovery here. Do not delete
  the .str file if you want to take advantage of this feature.

- A string gadget and associated popup labelled "Source translation directory".
  If you have some old translation files (the files with a .ct extension used
  by CatComp) that you want to recover, put them in a subdirectory of this
  directory that has the same name as the language they refer to. For example,
  if you have a previous .ct file containing the old Italian translations, and
  you specified "Dev:Workdir/" as source translation directory, you must put
  the file into "Dev:Workdir/italiano/". Dorkalize expects that the name of
  this file minus the .ct extension be the same as the name of the project
  minus the .dprj extension, if this is present.

- A string gadget and associated popup labelled "Destination translation
  directory". Dorkalize will put the translation and catalog files it generates
  into subdirectories of this directory that have the same name as the
  languages the files refer to (see above). NOTE THAT IF YOU USE THE SAME
  DIRECTORY FOR SOURCE AND DESTINATION YOUR OLD TRANSLATIONS WILL BE
  OVERWRITTEN AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER THEM IN CASE OF ERROR!
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorktabfiltri "Filters tab"

The "Filters" tab contains two groups.

- The "Pattern filters" group contains a string gadget and associated popup
  labelled "Filter file". This gadget contains the path and name of the file
  containing the filters used to rule off strings while scanning the source
  files. You can view and edit its contents by pressing the "Show filters"
  button, which will open the @{"filter window" link nodorkfiltri}.

- The "Tracking filter" group configures the tracking filter. The tracking
  filter scans the data of the last localization you performed on that project
  and tries to determine, for each string, whether it was localized or not. If
  it was not localized it is by default filtered out, unless a pattern filter
  decides it must instead be localized. This is extremely useful to avoid
  having to select each time which strings you want to localize. Anyway it is
  not unmistakable and you should check if all and only the strings you want to
  localize are in the string list.

  The tracking filter works by searching for patterns of strings that appear in
  the same order both in the old and new source files. The tracking depth is
  the number of consecutive strings that must appear in the same order to
  "lock" the filter. The higher this number, the more unlikely it is that the
  filter will lock erroneously, but the higher the chance to miss strings. A
  depth of 2 is a good compromise. A depth of 0 disables the tracking filter.

  The "Track inside files only" checkmark determines whether the filter
  searches for patterns in the whole set of files (not checked) or in each file
  separately (checked). Leaving it checked will do no harm.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorktablinguaggi "Languages tab"

The languages tab contains the list of languages you want to generate catalogs
for. To add a file, use the "Add" button: a list will open containing the
supported languages. To remove a language from the list, select it and click
the "Remove" button, or double-click it.

You can modify the supported languages editing the file "Dorkalize.lang",
located in the Dorkalize main directory. Simply enter one language per line.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkfinestrastringhe "String window"

This window contains a listview holding the strings that Dorkalize found in the
selected source files. Each line refers to a string. The listview has seven
columns:

The "Source file" column contains the source file from which the string was
extracted.

The "Pos" column contains a character which is d or D if the string was
contained in a #define, S if the string was contained in the body of a
function, and E otherwise. Strings marked with D or E will not be localized.
Dorkalize will set the attribute for strings in #defines depending upon the
status of the "Localize strings in defines" checkmark in the
@{"project options tab" link nodorktabopzioniproggetto}. Double-clicking on this column will toggle between the d
and D attributes.

The "Line", "Start" and "End" columns contain the line of the source file, the
initial column and the final column where the string is found.

The "Msg #" column contains the number that Dorkalize assigns to each string.
Identical strings in different places have the same number.

The "Text" column contains the text of the string.

Below the listview are six buttons. The "Remove" button will remove the
selected strings from the list and put them into the filtered strings list. The
"Add to filter" button adds the selected strings to the filter list, without
removing it from the string list. You have to press again the "Dorkalize"
button to have the new filters take effect. The "Show filtered" button opens
the @{"filtered string window" link nodorkfinestrastringhefiltrate}. The "Show filters" button opens the
@{"filter window" link nodorkfiltri}.

The "Create patch file" button will create a patch file containing all and only
the strings in the list. The "Patch sources" button will create the same patch
file and then start Localize or the internal patcher, depending on the setting
you entered in the @{"project options tab" link nodorktabopzioniproggetto}, to generate the localized C sources,
the C header file and the catalog descriptor. See the description of the
@{"project options" link nodorktabopzioniproggetto} to learn how to configure the process. The localized C sources
will be put into the "Localized-source" subdirectory of the directory
containing the original source file. If you selected some languages in the
@{"languages tab" link nodorktablinguaggi} in the main window, the @{"translated strings window" link nodorktraduzzione} will open.

Double-click on any column of a line (except the "Pos" column) to open the file
containing the string in the external viewer you can configure in the
@{"option window" link nodorkopzioni}. Double-click on the "Pos" column of a 'd' or 'D' string to
toggle its status between 'd' and 'D'.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkfinestrastringhefiltrate "Filtered string window"

This window contains a listview holding the strings that were filtered off the
source files or removed later by the user from the list in the @{"string window" link nodorkfinestrastringhe}.

The "Source file" column contains the source file from which the string was
extracted.

The "Pos" column contains a character which is d or D if the string was
contained in a #define, S if the string was contained in the body of a
function, and E otherwise.

The "Line", "Start" and "End" columns contain the line of the source file, the
initial column and the final column where the string is found.

The "Msg #" column contains the number that Dorkalize assigns to each string.
Identical strings in different lines have the same number.

The "Text" column contains the text of the string.

Below the listview are two buttons. The "Add back" button will remove the
selected strings from the list and put them back into the strings list in the
@{"string window" link nodorkfinestrastringhe}. The "Add to filter" button adds the current string to the
filter list, without removing it from the filtered string list. You have to
press again the "Dorkalize" button to have the new filters take effect.

Double-click on any column of a line (except the "Pos" column) to open the file
containing the line in the external viewer you can configure in the
@{"option window" link nodorkopzioni}. Double-click on the "Pos" column of a 'd' or 'D' string to
toggle its status between 'd' and 'D'.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkfiltri "Filter window"

This window contains a listview holding the filters for your current project.
The listview has three columns. The "Filter" column contains the filters. The
"Type" column controls whether the filter is a stopping or a passing one. The
"Status" column controls whether the filter is active; if it contains
"INACTIVE" the filter is ignored.

Each filter is an AmigaDOS standard pattern. Filtering works like this:
Dorkalize checks every string it finds in the source files against each active
filter in sequence, top to bottom of the list. When it finds a filter matching
the string, if the filter is a stopping one the string will not be added to the
list of strings to be localized, otherwise it will be added; in any case
Dorkalize will go on with the next string in the source files. Matching is
case-sensitive. If the string does not match any filter it will be added to the
list.

From above derives that the filters appear in the list by descending priority,
top to bottom. This means that, if you want for example to exclude all the
strings starting with "dork", except "dorkalize", you have to insert
"dorkalize" as a passing filter and, below it, "dork#?" as a stopping filter.
You can refer as an example to the supplied file, dorkafilter.dflt, which
contains some filters you should always keep active.

On the right of the listview are two buttons that you can use to move the
active filter up and down the list. You can also move selected filters using
drag'n'drop. Double-clicking on the Filter column removes a filter from the
list, while double-clicking on the Type and Status column will toggle the
contents of the clicked field. The active filter can be edited in the string
gadget below the listview; the changes are entered by pressing the Enter key.

In the bottom part of the window are seven buttons. "New" inserts a new filter.
"Pass" and "Stop" will set the type of the selected filters to PASS and STOP
respectively. "Active" and "Inactive" will set the status of the selected
filters to ACTIVE and INACTIVE respectively. "Remove" removes the selected
filters. "Clear" empties the list. "Save" saves the list into the file
specified in the @{"filters tab" link nodorktabfiltri} in the @{"main window" link nodorkprimafinestra}. "Save as" saves the list
into a user-specified file, which then is also set as the current filter file.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorktraduzzione "Translation window"

This window contains a list with three columns and a row per message. The
"Message number" column contains the message identifier. The "Original string"
column contains the nontraslated message. The "Translation" column contains the
translation for that string into the language selected by the cycle gadget
below. If a previous translation is found from an older translation file, it
will be shown here, otherwise this field will be empty.

You can edit the translation for the active row in the string gadget just under
the list; pressing the "Copy from original" button, the original not translated
string will be copied into the string gadget. Remember to press Enter to
confirm your edits.

The "Catalog version" string gadget contains the version of the catalog you are
creating; if one is recovered from an older translation file it will be shown
here.

The four buttons on the bottom are used to create the translation file (.ct)
for use with CatComp, or directly the catalog (spawning CatComp), for the
current language or for all the selected languages. Once you have created at
least a translation file, you can later recover the work done by pressing the
"Recover new translations" button in the @{"main window" link nodorkprimafinestra}.
@ENDNODE

@NODE nodorkopzioni "Option window"

The option window is opened from the "Set options..." menu item in the
"Options" menu. It contains:

- A string gadget with associated ASL popup gadget marked "Localize
  executable:". This must contain the location of the Localize executable, if
  you just want to use Localize instead of Dorkalize's internal patcher.

- A string gadget with associated ASL popup gadget marked "CatComp
