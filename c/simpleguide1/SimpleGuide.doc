------------------==================================------------------

SimpleGuide is created and programmed by Petter Nilsen, with input and
comments  from  Marius Mortensen.  Thanks to Michael Sinz for creating
to original SimpleRexx ARexx code which gave me the idea for doing the
same with AmigaGuide.

This  code  is  not  public  domain  but may be freely distributed for
non-commercial  purposes.   Use  it at your own risk.  However, if you
intent  to  use this code in one of your own applications, please give
me credit. Hope you find it helpful! 

What is SimpleGuide?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SimpleGuide  was  created  by  me for own use in our program THOR, the
most  advanced  offline  reader  currently on the Amiga (todays ad :).
SimpleGuide  does  much  of the gruntwork associated with the creation
and  use  of the AmigaGuide online help that Commodore has provided to
users  and programmers.  To use it, you simply link you program to the
SimpleGuide  module (simpleguide.c) and call SimpleGuide to create the
AmigaGuide  help  system,  open  nodes,  close  the  help  system etc.
Currently,  this  code  only  supports  opening AmigaGuide as an async
prosess.   There  might  be  some  problems  with  earlier versions of
amigaguide.library with this, but as far as I know these problems only
exist  with  V33  and early V34 versions.

Using SimpleGuide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting  up  the AmigaGuide help system for your application should be
fairly easy if you follow these simple steps:

1.   When  you  need  the  help  system,  call AmigaGuideOpen() with a
initialized NewAmigaGuide structure, as described in the documentation
for AmigaGuideOpen().  This function will open amigaguide.library, the
AmigaGuide   help  system  and  wait  for  the  startup  message  from
amigaguide.library.   This function will return a pointer to a context
that must be passed to all the other functions in SimpleGuide whenever
you  call  them.   Keep  the pointer around but don't modify it or its
contents.   You  might  call AmigaGuideOpen() more than once to set up
the  help  system  for  ie.  several different AmigaGuide files.  Each
call will return a unique context.

2.     Get    a    signal   from   SimpleGuide   with   the   function
GetAmigaGuideSignal()  and  wait  on  this signal in your usual signal
loop.   When  a  signal  arrives, use HandleAmigaGuide() to answer all
messages received from AmigaGuide.

3.  Whenever the user presses the HELP key (rawkey decimal code 95) or
requests  menyhelp,  call the SetGuideContext() function to align onto
the  node  you  want  to  show  for  the  user (se the documetation on
AmigaGuideOpen()   for   more   details)   then   call   the  function
SendGuideContext() to actually show the node.

4.   When you are through with the help system, call AmigaGuideClose()
for each context you received from AmigaGuideOpen().

Please  see  the  simpleguide.c  file for further information on these
functions.

Limitations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Only supports async opening of amigaguide.library.
- Does not support all functions in amigaguide.library
- Only replies to messages from amigaguide.library, without any error
  handling. 

Please  feel  free to modify the code as you like, but if you discover
any bugs or want to make additions, send a mail to me about them.
