Because this package is only usable by this people who own
MaxonC++ it's not neccessary to write a big documentation
because all commands are documented in the official handbook.

Here are only the steps for installation. First you have to copy
the diretories 'Arexx' to the directoy 'GoldED:Arexx' and
'presets' to GoldED:presets'. After that you have to select
the menu 'Config/Menus...' and there the button 'add' (or
something else. I'm using the german config. So I don't
know the name of this button) and select the file 'MaxonC++.men'.
You know have to save this new config. That's it!

Ther is one new command in this menu. It is the Command
'HotHelp'. This command gets the word under the cursor and
searches in HotHelp for this key and presents it on the screen.

I would recommend that you put all the commands on the
function-keys of your keyboard. It is much easier to work
in a text-editor without the mouse.

So, that's it for now. You can contact me for suggestions and bugs.
E-Mail is preferred.

Please excuse my bad english!!!!!

Bye, bye
