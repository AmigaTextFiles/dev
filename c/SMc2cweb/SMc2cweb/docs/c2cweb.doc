                       Amiga Port of c2cweb V1.4
                       =========================

This program was written 1994 originally by Werner Lemberg. I have
not made any changes to it in this port.

Source
------
The only (and main) problem was to make the getopt() function which is
not implemented for SAS/C (but for gcc). After reading the gcc-manual
I understood that it is used similar to ReadArgs for CLI-Commands but
uses the Un*x style (-xyz option). So I searched a program which uses
it and hoped it would use SAS/C as compiler. I found that GNUTar1.2
did just this so I just copied it (getopt.c, getopt.h) from there and
also added alloca.c to it (slight changes to alloca.c so I needed not
to include the whole port.c from GNUTar). That was all I needed.
I have tried it with a simple program and it seems to work fine.

I did not include the whole archive from CTAN:tex-archive/web/c_cpp/c2cweb
directory. What I left out are the MS-DOS binaries and the changes to
cweave (which are not needed for c2web anyway). If you're interested in
this, you can get it directly from there. If you're not sure about it read
the c2cweb.txt file in this directory.

If you want to recompile simply use the included SMakefile.

Purpose
-------
c2cweb will transform plain C or C++ code into a CWEB file to get a pretty
formatted output. You will need the cweb package which can be found on
Amnet as well (Aminet Set 2c or Aminet 9 CD) which contains the CTANGLE
and the CWEAVE binaries. To include your C/C++ code into a LaTeX document
simply use CWEAVE after having processed it with C2CWEB (which you can
also use to make a .tex-file from c2cweb.w, i.e. a documentation for it).
CTANGLE is only needed if you want to recreate c2cweb.c from c2cweb.w

Installation
------------

Simply copy C2CWEB to your favourite TeX binary directory. Then you have
to copy compiler.w to your CWEBINPUTS path. If you want to process the
example and/or you want to use german language you have to copy
macros/c2cweb.ger into a directory of your TEXINPUTS path.

Usage
-----

The only change the user has to do normally is to insert /*@@*/ starting an
empty line outside of a comment or string before the first function block
(normally main(){ ... }) in the C code. After this command c2cweb writes each
function block into a section. Before /*@@*/ all stuff is written into a
(possibly large) section. If you want to structure this further or if you have
structure definitions between functions, use /*@*/ to start a new section
without starting the function block algorithm (and of course /*@@*/ before the
next function).
The function algorithm simply counts paired braces; if none are open, a new
section will begin.
The file example.c has these control codes inserted already.


The syntax is

    c2cweb [switches] csourcefile(s) | @responsefile(s)

The possible switches are:

-v:

all comments are written in typewriter type. You will need this if you have
already formatted your comments, for example

            /********************/
            /*    example.c     */
            /********************/.

-t value:

all tabs will be expanded, and the -t switch defines the tab length (default
value is 4).

-l:

causes all linefeeds inside of C text to be output explicitly by inserting
@/ (a CWEB control code) at the end of each code line.

-o directory:

sets the output directory which must exist already.

-b "titlestring":

defines a title with the titlestring enclosed in double quotes. This string
will be passed directly to \TeX.

-1:

one-sided output (i.e. left header is the same as right header).


The last steps are calling CWEAVE with the transformed master file and then
calling TeX to get a printable .dvi-file.


An example:

    your input files are
        header1.h, header2.h, file1.c, file2.c, file3.c

    you must call then
        c2cweb [options] header*.h file*.c

    to get the *.*w files. c2cweb will now process your files and tell you
    which file is the input file for CWEAVE (we'll assume file3.cw).

    After calling
        cweave [options] file3.cw

    you get a .tex file (and some additional auxiliary files) which should be
    processed further by PLAIN TeX (LaTeX is not supported):

        tex file3[.tex]


Please read the `Hints and Tricks' section about enhancements and limitations
of c2cweb in the file c2cweb.w (say `smake documentation' to build the .dvi
file).
