History of the c2cweb package
=============================


Version 1.0 :
1-Mar-1994      only two persons got it :-)

Version 1.1 :
8-Mar-1994      initial release

                new:
                    $ in identifiers are now allowed (CWEAVE)
                    whitespaces before preprocessor commands are now
                      allowed (CWEAVE)
                    the concatenation operator ## added (CWEAVE)

                    option -1 added (one-sided output) (c2cweb)

                    minor changes affecting documentation only

                errors:
                    Ver 1.0 erroneously reported `@' outside of a string
                      (c2cweb)
                    /*}*/ started a new code section at function block level
                      if in /*@*/-mode (c2cweb)
                    tabs were not handled correctly (c2cweb)

Version 1.2:
13-Apr-1994     new:
                    c2cweb and cweave should now compile smoothly under UNIX
                      (tested with Linux)
                    paper format definition moved from c2cweb to compiler.w

                    some files renamed; makefile for c2cweb added
                errors:
                    A serious bug introduced in Ver. 1.1 caused whitespaces 
                      be swallowed (c2cweb)

Version 1.3:
20-June-1994:   new:
                    Makefiles enhanced

                    new patchlevel of emx.exe

                    c2cweb.dvi added

                    c2cweb.txt updated
                errors:
                    '"' couldn't be used; corrected (c2cweb)

                    sometimes the macro `\e' was concatenated with the next
                      word; '\e ' now written (c2cweb)

                    wrong index entry for dollar sign corrected (CWEAVE)

                    bug in original CWEAVE corrected:
                      you couldn't write e.g. @<Cases for |'\''|@>

Version 1.4:
20-Aug-1994:    new:
                    based now on CWEB 3.2 (July 1994)

                    original CWEB source files for CWEAVE added

                    additional cwebmac.tex style; original cwebmac.tex renamed
                     in cwebmac.ori

                    c2cweb.txt has now an installation section

                    C-code example modified
                errors:
                    \ at the end of the line in multi-line strings will now be
                      treated correctly (c2cweb)

                    from 1.3 : '\e ' is of course wrong. It must be '\e{}' (and
                    sometimes '\e{}%') (c2cweb)

                    //-comment handling was buggy (c2cweb)

                    braces in comments could cause an error (c2cweb)

                    email address changed (same host; old address became
                      unreachable)
