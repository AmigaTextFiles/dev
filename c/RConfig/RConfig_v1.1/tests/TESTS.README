This directory contains the following test programs used to verify
the generated code.  These can also serve as examples on interfacing
with the replacement library, particularly with respect to #defines,
#includes, and function usage.

  (1) detach
  (2) resstart
  (3) stkchk
      (a) better
      (b) dynastack
  (4) alloca
      (a) safe
      (b) risky
  (5) stkchk & setjmp (interdependence test)
  (6) alloca & setjmp (interdependence test)
  (7) alloca, stkchk & setjmp (interdependence test)

Each test directory contains a source test file and an AmigaDOS script
(called "TEST) for generating the appropriate replacement library,
"making" the test program, setting up the run environment, and
conducting the test.

The "make" section for generating the replacement library in each
test case was obtained by capturing the rconfig output to a file,
and then trimming it.  Eg:

    cc RLIB:rlib.c -oT:rlib.o -m0d -pl -sa -s0b -sf -sm -ss -sp -sn
        -r04 -r06 -sr
    as RLIB:crt0.a68 -o T:crt0.o
    cc RLIB:_main.c -oT:_main.o -d__DETACH_MAIN -m0b -m0d -pl -sa
        -s0b -sf -sm -ss -sp -sn -r04 -r06 -sr
    lb rlib.lib T:crt0.o T:_main.o T:rlib.o
