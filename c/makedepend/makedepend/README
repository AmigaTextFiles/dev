Short: makefile dependency examiner
type: dev/c
uploader: rk@gup.uni-linz.ac.at

This is a port of makedepend, a sophisticated makefile dependency examiner.
I found this little tool within the distribution of ET++, an application
framework, running on UNIX.

makedepend scans C sources like a C preprocessor and evaluates #define, #undef
#ifdef... directives to determine all necessary include files. The result is
appended to a specially prepared makefile automatically.

Don't flame me for the horribly ugly programming style - I have just made all
necessary changes to get it work with SAS/C 6.50.
