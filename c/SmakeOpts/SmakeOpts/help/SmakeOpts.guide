@node "Introduction" "Introduction"

I wrote this program because I was to lazy to find a method how to implement
a nice GUI with ARexx for the Editor BED. I wanted to be able to set some
of the smake options and then call them automatically every time I run
smake from the Editor ("Build Project").

The main motivation is that scopts does not support smake options so you
would either have to change the preferences every time you want to change
some options in the Editor or you have to make thousands of menus.

The main use of the program will be to call it from a Editor in my opinion,
to set the options and after that the Editor calls smake with the saved
options (it is saved to a file called "smopts").

Of course you won't need this program if you don't use SAS/C 6.x.

@node "Freeware" "FREEWARE"

Freeware
--------
SmakeOpts is FREEWARE. This means, that you can use it without the need to
pay anything to me (Except you want to :-), I'd also like gifts like A5000s,
Fantasy books, CDRoms, Key Files and more)

I have invested many hours in the program in the hope to create a useful
utility for everyone and I am already satisfied with a mail, postcard or
E-Mail as feedback, what should not be a big sacrifice for a small equivalent
return.

Usage rights
------------

The program may be used for private purposes only. Every commercial usage of
the program without my written permission is prohibited. This includes the
usage within CDRoms and Magazine Cover Disks.

Source Code
-----------

You may use the source code as an simple example how to write an application
with @{"BGUI" link "BGUI"}. You should however not change major things in the source code and
redistribute under the same name. If you intend to make a huge project out of
it you must mention that I was the one who had the basic idea :-).
If you want to make some minor changes you are free to do it. If you want to
redistribute the new code you should let me know about it and why you did it.

Constructive criticism
----------------------

If you like/dislike or even hate please let me know about it. I'd like to get
critics and suggestions. If not the future development will be restricted
and you don't want this (do you ? :-).

@node "Features" "Features"

Features
--------

SmakeOpts has the following features:

- Runs as well from WB as from CLI (supported by tool types)

- Is able to run on a Public Screen

- uses a GUI created with @{"BGUI" link "BGUI"}

- includes example definition & rexx scripts for BED

- @{"BGUI" link "BGUI"} library included

- Source code included

@endnode

@node "Installation" "How to install the program"

Installation
------------

The installation of the program itself is quite simple. Just copy it to sc:c
or to another directory in your path if you use another one for external
SAS_C programs. The Guide should be copied to sc:help (I have sc:help in
my Amigaguide/Path, you need to add this if you wanna use the Online Help).

@{"BGUI.library" link "BGUI"} should be copied to LIBS:. This library is the newest beta
Version (V40.8) and if you're unsure about that you should get the BGUI
archive from Aminet (dev/gui) and install Version 39.

If you use BED as Editor you can as well add/change your SASC/C menu from
the SAS/C.dfn file. I only added this menu to the file and it contains one
new menu for the Options and the changed Build Project Menu. You also need
to copy the rewritten Build.bed (compatible to the old version) and the
SetSmakeOpts.bed  ARexx scripts to BED:rexx/SASC/.

Attention: I made more changes to the SAS/Menu than just the above mentioned.
I created some additional ARexx script (not in this archive) and sent them
to the author of BED, but they are not (yet ?) included with BED!

@endnode

@node "Requirements" "Requirements"

Requirements
------------

SmakeOpts needs the following requirement to work:

- An Amiga with at least 512 KB RAM (it should work, never testet it though)

- OS2.04 or better (I myself haven't tested it with OS2.04, because I only can
  use OS3.1, but I didn't use any 3.1 Features.)

- SAS/C 6.0 or higher (I have it only tested with SAS/C 6.56). I don't know if
  there are options which were added after release 6.0.

- @{"BGUI.library" link "BGUI"} V39 or higher (included in the archive). Only tested with V40.8

@endnode

@node "Usage" "Call from CLI/Workbench)"

Usage
-----

The usage from Workbench and CLI is principially the same. The names of the
CLI parameters are the same like the tool types, if you call it from the WB.

SmakeOpts 0.5 BETA 1. Copyright (C) 1996 Reinhard Katzmann. All rights reserved

USAGE: SmakeOpts P=PUBSCREEN/K

The PUBSCREEN keywords lets you open the Option program on another Public
Screen than Workbench.

Example:

> SmakeOpts PUBSCREEN=Blacks_Editor

This opens SmakeOpts on the Screen of BED.

After that you can edit your settings (see @{"GUI" link "GUI"}). If you save them
a file "smopts" will be created. This file will be read again with your
options if you call SmakeOpts next time.

smopts file
-----------

Now you have created your options you ask yourself how to use them. Smake
itself has no ENV-Variables itself for the configuration so I used alittle
trick in the OS (usually used for calling a filereq in CLI environment on
programs which don't have one):

> smake `type smopts`

Now smake is called with your configuration file (which actually contains
the parameters you defined with SmakeOpts before).

@endnode

@node "GUI" "Usage of the GUI"

I think the GUI is pretty intuitive to use, so I will not discuss in detail.
If you have installed the Guide in a proper place in your Amigaguide Path
you can get online help pressing the HELP key.

I give you here an overview which GUI element which smake option corresponds:

- DEBUG: You have to add a DEBUG variable to your smakefile (see the @{"Smakefile" link "src/Smakefile/main"}
  in the src directory for an example (this link only works if you have the
  src directory in the same directory like this guide)) to be able to use
  this option. It adds the variable DEBUG="DEBUG full" to the command line
  thus replacing your empty defined variable.

- SMAKE DEBUG: corresponds -d switch of smake

- ALL: corresponds -a switch of smake

- SILENT: corresponds -s switch of smake

- ERASE: corresponds -e switch of smake

- SMAKE FILE: corresponds -f <filename> switch of smake

- TARGET NAME: this name will be added at the end of the call thus telling
  Smake to use this target name instead of the default.

- DEFAULT FILE: corresponds -b <filename> switch of smake

- SAVE: Save the options under the filename "smopts"

- CANCEL: Hmm, ???

@endnode

@node "Technical" "Technical Data :-)"

Technical hints
---------------

The GUI itself has been designed using BGUIBuilder V0.91beta. I simply
had to integrate the ready GUI in my source code. This program makes
makeing @{"BGUI" link "BGUI"} GUIs really easy :-). The program uses parts from _main.c
(source code delievered with SAS/C) for reading the smopts file. I
created a datatype to hold the switches and it arguments (if there are
any). I have not tested it but it could be possible that you can compile
progam with DICE as well. I have no idea for GCC (mainly concerning the
tooltypes). If you're interested in these and have solutions send
some patches to me.

If you want to recompile it you need to copy the bgui.lib to sc:lib/ so the
linker can find it. The lib only opens the BGUI.library (I'm a lazy man ;)

If you want me to add rexx scripts and/or prefs file for other editors like
GED, XDME, Emacs or whatever which you have created please send them to me.
(You will get some credits in return :-).

BGUIBuilder automatically uses the stringpatch (which corrects a bug in
Intuition Integer Gadgets) and so I included it though the program does
not make use of it itself. Read the Smakefile for further information.

This Guide, the program and all additionally text files have been written
with BED (by Marco Negri). It can be found on Aminet.

@node "Bugs_Ideen" "Bugs and Ideas"

There's hardly any program which has not some bugs. So I don't pretend that
mine would have none. But I try to get the program as stable as possible on
all the different computer systems which meet the requirements.

Known bugs
----------

- One problem: the `type smopts` trick does not work if you use something
  like DEBUG="DEBUG full", only DEBUG="DEBUG=full" works. Ideas how to solve
  this problems are very much appreciated!

Bug reports and Ideas
---------------------

If you find a bug or have an idea, how to improve the program, don't heitate
to tell it to me.

If you want me to add rexx scripts and/or prefs file for other editors like
GED, XDME, Emacs or whatever which you have created please send them to me.
(You will get some credits in return :-).

Of course bugs are handled in preference to the ideas and I also try to get
rid of them as fast as my spare time allows. But still I'll collect all ideas
and endeavour after answering all mail. You can reach me through my @{"contact address" link "Adress" 0}.

@endnode

@node "Future" "Future Development of the program"

If you want to see some features added, please let me know about it. If the
program is stable enough in my eyes I will release a non-beta Version.

I have some ideas for this program but I don't need them so it depends on
you if you want to see them in a future Version:

- Use another file than "smopts" as Option (C=CONFFILE/K)
- Add practically "unneeded" switches from smake as well.
- Possibility to run smake directly using a "RUN" button object.
- Ideas from you.

   `BGUI',  (C) Copyright 1993-1995 Jaba Development. All rights reserved. This
program is GiftWare. This means that if you want to use the programs you are
morally obligated to reward the author with a gift that, you think, matches
his efforts. If you cannot think of a gift (come on! be creative ;), a small
financial donation will always be gladly accepted.

   I have thought about how to release this package for quite some time. My
initial thought went out to shareware but I soon forgot about this. Since most
of the libraries of this kind seem to be shareware I do not think that many
people like this simply because it's anoying to have to pay for a library if
you had to pay for the application as wel.

   To avoid these problems I have decided to release this package as giftware
for people writing freely distributable software. With "freely distributable
software" I mean non-crippeled, free of charge software. Authors who wish to
use `BGUI' in shareware and/or commercial programs must pay for the usage of
`BGUI' before actually using it.

   ShareWare and/or commercial usage is `not' allowed without:

      1) Prior written permission from the author.
      2) A small finacial donation of US$ 20,-, DM 30,- or HFL 30,-.
      3) A free and registered copy of the product including free updates that
         still make use of the library.

   The idea behind this distribution policy is simple. You make money with the
aid of `BGUI'? I want to get my (very humble) share.

   This software is not crippeled so when you register it you will not recieve
a key-file or an updated version. Registering simply buys you the right to use
this software in shareware and/or commercial applications.

   Resonable, eh?

Introduction
************

   `BGUI' is a BOOPSI based shared library contaning a number of BOOPSI
classes.  It allows for easy creation and managing of font sensitive and size
adjustable GUI's on the Amiga. Hmm, where have I read something like this
before..., I hear you say.

   YES! This is yet another GUI library. I know there has been a lot of
discussions about the usabillity and neccesity of GUI libraries on the nets
lately. Still, being the ignorant bugger that I am, at some point I felt it
was necessary to write yet another one.

   Believe me when I say that `BGUI' was not intended to become a releasable
project. I started coding `BGUI' simply because I was amazed what MUI did
using BOOPSI. Therefore I started coding some BOOPSI classes as a learning
experience.

   Hmmm... This is beginning to sound like an excuse... As if I did something
terrible ;)

   The point is that, while working on BGUI, I saw many GUI libraries being
released and not one of them really seemed to take off. This made me think
that all this talk about "For every app I run I need to install a different
GUI library" really is bull. Please correct me if I'm wrong but I have yet to
see a program requiring a GUI library (with the exception of MUI ofcourse).

   Sure there are a lot available but MUI is the only one which actually seems
to be used by the programmers.

   This is the reason for `BGUI'. I have tryed to create a library which does
it's thing simular to MUI eliminating the biggest problems that programmers
seem to have with MUI. Meaning no fancy
background-pen-frame-text-image-whatever settings editor, not a zillion extra
images, no external class libraries etc.

   `BGUI' is a single library which can be removed as easely as it can be
installed. It provides an easy way to create and control GUI's without becoming
excessive in what it does.

   I guess time will tell if `BGUI' is going to be accepted or not...

                         Add-ons (by the Author)
                         =======================

I took the freedom to add some things from the current development.
I am active member of the BGUI mailing list. Currently there is
a BGUI Builder in progress whose Beta Version is avalaible on the
BGUI homepage. Also discussion were made about a Prefs program
including some examples which also should be on the homepage.

Attention: New Homepage address: http://www..users.dircon.co.uk/~nmc/bgui/

New Features for V40
********************

   * Dragn' Drop for all BGUI objects, especially for Listview class

   * Tooltips for all BGUI objects (short help)

   * Palette and PopButton Class (already existed but not on the feature list
     above, Palette now supports DnD)

   * Multiselection Filerequester are now possible

   * Easy allocation/freeing BitMap functions (for both OS2.x & OS3.x)

   * Listview can scroll horizontally (don't know if this a new feature)

   * BGUI Objects can now be added to the Window border (I don't like the
     appearance of the Objects like it is done now, hopefully this will
     be changed in the future).

   * I've lost the history list since 40.5 (except 40.6) :-(

In development (by other people) are a screen class, a multi colum Listview
class (up to now based on hooks) including some other classes as base for it.
I develop myself a magnify class (works nearly completely, only have major
problems with BitmapScale()) and will develop a mapeditor class (for my own
Role Playing System) somewhen in the future.

Bad News from Jan Van.den.baard:

 Due to some unfortunate (private) circumstances I am unable to continue
putting in the development time in BGUI that  is  necessary to  keep the
project alive.

 I certanly do not want BGUI to end because of this and it does not have
to.  Is  there  somebody  who is seriously willing and able to take over
further development of BGUI?

 I am willing to give that person  the  complete  source code  and other
BGUI related materials. I will also try to give some help  to get things
going.

 If this does not work out I will prepare  one  last  archive which will
contain BGUI as it is now, include the whole source code  and  upload it
as a  final  release on AmiNet.

 I am sorry that I can't do it myself anymore but that is the way it is.
