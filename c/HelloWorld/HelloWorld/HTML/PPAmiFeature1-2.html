<H2>The Amiga implementation</H2>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
The Amiga implements multitasking through the operating system's kernel, Exec. It is Exec's job to handle multitasking. Exec uses a state-mechanism, each task can
have one of three main states: <I>Waiting</I>,<I>Ready</I> and <I>Running</I>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
A <U>waiting</U> task is a task which is busy waiting for the result of an action, such as the user pressing a button on screen, the disk to finish loading or similar things.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
A <U>ready</U> task is a task which is not waiting for anything, but which is not
currently running. It is waiting for Exec to give it it's 'turn'.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
The <U>running</U> task is the task that is currently executing. It will remain running for a specified time, until it needs to wait, or until a process with a higher priority becomes 'ready'.

<H2>Task's and Processes</H2>
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
Under Amiga OS, there are two building blocks for multitasking, the first is
a <U>task</U>, the second is a <U>process</U>.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
A <I>task</I> is the basic building block used by Exec to run the multitasking
system. A <I>process</I> on the other hand, is created by the Amiga-Dos library. The differences are minor, but important. The main difference between tasks and
processes is that a task is not allowed to call any Amiga-Dos functions. Which means a task cannot use files and file-handles and can't, as a result, print output
to the screen using standard IO functions.
