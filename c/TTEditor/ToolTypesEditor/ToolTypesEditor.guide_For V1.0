@NODE "Main" "ToolTypes Editor General Information:"
@PREV "Index"

   A GUI for editing & viewing ToolTypes contained in an Icon.

   The main reason for this program is to use it within other programs
   as a ToolType Editor, thus saving you (but mostly myself) the headache
   of having to write your own ToolTypes editor (again & again).
   
   Here is an @{" example " LINK "Example"} of how to call it from your own program.
   
   When the program is called from a CLI/Shell, it expects at least one
   argument, the name of the Icon you wish to view/change.  There is an
   optional second argument that you can specify, the name of the Public
   Screen to open the program onto, which allows you use the program
   from your own programs.
   
  @{SHINE SYNOPSIS}
      ToolTypesEditor <IconName> [PublicScreenName]
       
   The program can be called from Workbench (but why would you want to when
   there are other, more complete Icon editors available?).
      
  @{BOLD HISTORY}
       1.0 ToolTypes Editor is now working correctly!

@NODE "Example" "How to call ToolTypesEditor from your code:"
@PREV "Main"

   Here is an example of how to use ToolTypesEditor inside your own
   program:
   
   @{FG SHINE}
   void CallToolTypesEditor( void )
   { 
      char command[256];

      strcpy( &command[0], "ToolTypesEditor" );
      strcat( &command[0], " " );
      strcat( &command[0], IconFileName ); // has path also.
      strcat( &command[0], " " );
      strcat( &command[0], PublicScreenName );

      /*
      ** or perhaps you prefer:

         sprintf( command, "ToolTypesEditor %s %s",
                            IconFileName, PublicScreenName 
                );
      */   
      // System() is an AmigaDOS call (but you knew that didn't you?).

      if (System( &command[0], TAG_DONE ) < 0)
         {
         // Tell the User about an error condition:

         sprintf( ErrMsg, 
                  "%s\n couldn't be run by the System,\n"
                  "check your spelling!", command
                );

         // My personal EasyRequest() call:
         UserInfo( ErrMsg, "Invalid Icon Name?" );
         }
   }
   @{FG TEXT}

   If anyone would care to send @{" me " LINK "Author"} an example of how to use LoadSeg()
   so that ToolTypesEditor doesn't have to be external to a program,
   I'll be happy to send that person a copy of the source code for
   ToolTypesEditor.

@PREV "Main"
@NEXT "ToolTypesLV"

   @{B}ToolTypes used by ToolTypesEditor:@{UB}

      @{SHINE DEFAULTDIR}   = System:Tools (Default)
      
      DefaultDir specifies where to begin looking for icons.
        
      @{SHINE PUBLICSCREEN} = Workbench    (Default)

      PublicScreen tells the program which screen to open its GUI onto.
      
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ToolTypesLV"
@PREV "Main"

   When you select a ToolType from this ListView Gadget, it gets written
   into the @{" ToolType " LINK "ToolTypeString"} string Gadget below.  You may change the ToolType 
   there, but it will not take effect unless you save the ToolTypes.
   
   Any changes made to the ToolTypes won't be sent to the Icon until the
   @{" Save " LINK "Save"} Button is pressed & released.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ToolTypeString"
@PREV "ToolTypesLV"

   When you select a ToolType from the @{" ListView Gadget " LINK "ToolTypesLV"}, it gets written
   into this string Gadget.  You may change the ToolType here, but it
   will not change in the Icon until you press & release the @{" Save " LINK "Save"} Button.
   
@ENDNODE

@NODE "VanillaKeys" "Keys that ToolTypes Editor recognizes:"

  @{SHINE "s or S:"}Same as pressing the @{" SAVE " LINK "Save"} Button.

  @{SHINE "r or R:"}Same as pressing the @{" RESTORE " LINK "Restore"} Button.

  @{SHINE "c or C:"}Same as pressing the @{" CANCEL " LINK "Cancel"} Button.

  @{SHINE "i or I:"}Shows an Information requester.

@ENDNODE


@NODE "Cancel" "Cancel Button:"
@PREV "Main"

   Pressing & releasing this button will exit the program without making
   any changes to the Icon ToolTypes.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Save" "Save Button:"
@PREV "Main"

   Pressing & releasing this button will exit the program after saving
   @{B}all@{UB} of your changes to the Icon ToolTypes.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "Restore" "Restore Button:"
@PREV "Main"

   Pressing & releasing this button will undo @{B}all@{UB} changes that you
   made to the ToolTypes.  The other two buttons will exit the program.
@ENDNODE

@NODE "FileName" "File Name string Gadget:"
@PREV "Main"

   Either enter the Icon name you wish to change/view in this gadget, or 
   press the @{" ASL file requester " LINK "ASLButton"} button to the right in order to select an
   Icon name from the filing system.  @{B}ToolTypesEditor@{UB} is smart enough
   to remove the @{B}.info@{UB} from the end of your selection so the program won't
   crash.
   
@ENDNODE

@NODE "ASLButton"
@PREV "Main"

   Either press this button in order in order to select an Icon name
   from the filing system or enter the Icon name you wish to change/view in
   the @{" File Name " LINK "FileName"} string Gadget.

  If your conscience is bugging you to contribute some cash for my

  ToolTypesEditor was written using @{B}SAS-C V6.58@{UB}.

  The GUI was put together with GadToolsBox V37.300 (14.3.93) (C)
  1991-1993 by Jaba Development.  I wish that there was an easy way to pay
  for this godsend of a program (Thanx guys!).
