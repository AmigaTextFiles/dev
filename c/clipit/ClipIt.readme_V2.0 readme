Uploader:  jimbot@frontiernet.net (Jim Steichen)
Author:    jimbot@frontiernet.net (Jim Steichen)
Type:      dev/c
Requires:  68020+, V3.1+ Amiga OS or PowerPC & AmigaOS4+
Version:   2.0

ClipIt! is a GUI that allows the User to access the Clipboard system in 
AmigaDOS.  It was created with GadToolsBox V2.0b & the SAS-C Compiler 
V6.58.  The Program was re-written to use gcc V3.4.4 & works on the AmigaOne
PowerPC & AmigaOS4.  The classic version can no longer be tested by me
(sorry about that).  The source code can be used & modified as long as you acknowledge
the original Author.  You need the functions in CommonFuncs.o in order to
re-compile this program.  Very few non-ANSI functions were used to make 
this program, specifically stci_d(), which is an Integer to ASCII convertor
function from the SAS-C link library (this does not apply to the PowerPC
version!).  Only FTXT & ILBM clip types are recognized by the program (what
other kinds are there??).

WARNING:  There might still be some bugs in this program, so only use it on
          copies of your clips!
