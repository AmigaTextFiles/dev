A Tool for automatically generating a 'DMakefile' for DiCe's Make utility.
Features include a fully graphical user interface, automatic scanning of
source files for headerfile dependancies and handling of precompiled 
header dependancies.  Supports all DiCe compiler options and uses symbol
names and variable assignments in the output file, grouping all files
with the same options together.  Takes into account the environment
variable DCCOPTS.
