VisualMaker      A Tool for automatically generating a  'DMakefile'  for 
                 DiCe's Make utility. Features include a fully graphical 
                 user interface, automatic  scanning of source files for
                 headerfile  dependancies  and  handling  of precompiled 
                 header dependancies. Supports all DiCe compiler options 
                 and uses symbol names and variable  assignments in  the  
                 output file, grouping all files  with  the same options  
                 together. Takes  into account the  environment variable 
                 DCCOPTS.
                 Version 1.0. Requires Amiga DOS 2.0. Binary only.
