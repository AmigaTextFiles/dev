                    Copyright © 1995-1998 by Stefan Kost

This is a collection of some nice macros for c-programmers. Not much today,
but I hope you help me to let it grows.

How to use it ?
---------------

Simply copy it anywhere in your includepath and #include it.

I think it`s not necessary to describe the macros (You find a short description
in the include-file.).


Why use it ?
------------

Macros helping you to write a better readable source-code. Further you may
learn some new tricks by reading the include file.

Support
-------

Please mail me or write me and sending me more macros or ideas.
