Introduction:
	This program is a small GUI for Volker Bartelman's VBCC compiler
	made because I was tired of typing in the cli all the time.

Legal:
	This program is freeware, no more than a nominal fee may be
	charged for distribution of this program, it may however be
	added on any PD/Shareware CD-rom and on Amiga Format cover CD.

	The content of this archive may not be added to, reverse
	engineered or in otherways changed from its original state.

Installation:
	Well, it is not very easy to start, and not as powerfull as
	some of the commercial C packages but it is free :-) and it
	has continued support.

	Edit the "VBCC-startup" file to match your location of VBCC
	and place it in your s: directory, place the vbccgui
	executable somewhere (preferably c: or you have to edit the
	VBCC-startup file further) and place the VBCC icon where you
	can reach it (I have left mine in the Workbench	window)

	Copy the "vbccgui.config" file to the vbcc: path, as the program
	is not yet ready to handle if this file is missing or misplaced!

	If you do not have MagicWB installed, copy the font to your
	fonts: directory.

Usage:
	Now start VBCC from the icon and you will see the window of
	VBCC-gui v1.2 with its 10 gadgets.

	the six upper gadgets are two string gadgets where you can
	put the location of input and output files, and two "H" gadgets
	that call up a window showing the last 10 files you have used as
	input or output, and two "F" gadgets that brings up a
	file-selector for input.

	The tree gadgets below are as follows:

	Include Math library? Will link with the math library so you
				can use the float datatype.

	Execute? Will ask you after compiling if you want to run the
				program just compiled.

	Close con? Will close the console window after your program.

	The OK gadget below will compile your source to the destination
	and if promted by the above gadgets will ask you if you want to
	run the executeable.

History:
	changes from 1.0 to 1.01: Some bugs fixed.
	changes from 1.01 to 1.02: Some more bugs fixed!
	changes from 1.02 to 1.1: Config file added.
	changes from 1.1 to 1.2: History list and File selector added.

Future:
	Additions to this gui will be made after input from you!
	Write to my girlfriend's email sorcia@post8.tele.dk (we live
	together so I will get it too :-) and write VBCC-gui in the
	subject.

	I have planned for linking with multiple .lib files, and an
	easy to use fd_to_lib funktion.

	In the far future I may make an arexx port to this version.

	Also in my mind is an idea to make a fully IDE using vbcc.
