Usage

	change {-cCflprx} {expression |-f patfile} file1 [file2 [file3...]]


Options

    -_: toggle _ is magic character
    -c: changed lines only are printed
    -C: changed lines are counted and reported on
    -f: a file (patfile) contains a list of expressions to be used
        in modifying the files' lines
    -l: line numbering enabled
    -p: prints out pattern(s) change is using
    -r: replace file with changed file
    -x: exact matches for lspec required


Explanation

     change allows one to change files using regular expressions.  It is
     similar to the substitution capability of Unix's sed.  Regular
     expressions include wild cards, ranges, subfields, etc, and are
     very similar to Unix's regular expressions.

     Changes are specified via commands in the following format:

                <-----lspec----->  chgpat tostring rspec
                [/.../|#[,{#|$}]]c/chgpat/tostring/[#|g]
                       separator: ^      ^        ^

   lspec: is the line specification.  It is either of the form
     "#", "#,#", "#,$", or "/lspec-pat/".  Lines to be changed
     must possess line numbers in the range "#1,#1", "#1,#2", "#1
     to the end-of-file".  Alternatively, the lspec may be started
     with a separator character, and only those lines which have
     a matching "lspec-pat"tern given by the lspec format
     /lspec-pat/ will be changed.  Note that the "lspec-pat" is a
     sub-expression as defined below.

        If the lspec has an operator (!&|), and chgpat is not
     null (empty), then Boolean logic is enabled.  In that case,
     {}!&| can be used to enable changes for lines which match
     some logical function of patterns in the lspec.  The {} can
     be used (like parentheses) to change precedence.

   chgpat: The changes will be made at the places in the line where
     the first sub-expression occurs.

   tostring: The "tostring" will be substituted for those string(s) which
     match the "chgpat" pattern.

   rspec: The "rspec" (right-side specification) gives the number of
     times the change is to be iterated on a given text line.  The
     default is 1.  The rspec may be any positive integer or 'g'.
     The 'g'  means:

         "perform change over all chgpat matches (ie. global) on each line".

   Magic Characters:

     In the "/lspec/", "chgpat", and "tostring", certain characters
     possess "magic" properties -- ie. they act as wildcards, etc. (see the
     table below).

     When preceded by a backslash ('\') then the "magic" meaning of
     the associated character is removed.

    ?: wildcard - matches any character
    *: matches 0 to any number of the preceding character.  Uses
       backwards context matching (matches as much as possible given
       the context)
    %: matches 0 to any (like *), but uses forward context matching
       (matches as little as possible given the context)
    +: matches 1 to any number of the preceding character
    `: matches 0 or 1 of the preceding character
    ~: matches so long as it is not the following character
    [...]: match if the character is any of the characters between the
       braces.  Furthermore, a range such as "[w-z]" may be used.
    #: matches any digit
    @: matches any alphabetic character
    _: matches any white space (ie. like [ \t\n^$] )
    ^: match if matching string is at the beginning of the line
    $: match if matching string is at the end of the line
    {...}: sub-string to be stored for tostring usage (see '&#')
    &: (only in tostring) copy entirety of chgpat
    &#: (only in tostring) copy the #th parenthesized sub-string of
        chgpat. (# is a digit from 1 to 9)
    &c#: substitute the character `c' for every character in the
         #th substring.  Note that `c' can be `\h', etc.
    &@L#: convert subfield to lower case
    &@U#: convert subfield to upper case
    &@X#: exchange case of subfield

   Escaped Characters:

       Escaped magic characters (ex. \$) lose their "magic" meaning.
    Most other escaped characters retain their normal meaning.  However,
    the following escaped characters are replaced as follows:

    Escape-Sequence    Result    Escape-Sequence    Result
         \e            escape         \o###          octal char
         \f            formfeed       \t             tab
         \h            backspace      \x##           hexadecimal char
         \n            newline        \A - \Z        control char
    The ##/### digit sequences may have 1-2/1-3 digits.

    The change program was compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following
    options: CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8.

    Good luck, and let me know of any problems you encounter, and any attaboys
    will be appreciated :)
