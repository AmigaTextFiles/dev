Version: 2.05


Usage:

    flist [filename1 [filename2 [filename3...]]
    flist "?"


Options:
	-a     : use antimagic on patterns
	-Amagic: specify "magic" characters for antimagic
    -c     : produce output suitable for inclusion in a comment
    -C     : no comments next to prototypes, etc
	-d     : c++ ctags mode: allow duplication of class::func as func
	-e     : etags mode (generates a <TAGS> file)
	-f     : like -m, but filename:func tags, too
    -G     : only global functions printed (no static)
    -l     : include linenumber in comment field
    -l     : with -Ppat, include filename
    -ll    : with -Ppat, include filename and linenumber
	-L     : lint mode output
    -m     : merge tags with hdrtags if present
    -p     : produce prototype declarations without user variables
	-Ppat  : print "funcname : pattern" while processing function bodies
    -s#    : set screenwidth to specified value
    -S     : only static functions printed (no global)
    -t     : ctags mode: creates a tags file
    -u     : produce prototypes with user variables
    -v     : print filenames as they're processed
    -x     : extern type listing


Explanation:

    Normal output consists of the files' names and a list of functions contained
    therein (for the C and C++ languages). Flist can accept input from the standard
    input.

    Optional forms of output include: <tags> file, prototypes, extern style
    (old K&R), and a form suitable for inclusion in a comment.  One may
    restrict the output to globally accessable functions or to local (static)
    ones.

    The "ctags" mode supports both C and C++.  The C++ mode generates
    tags by function name as usual, but will also generate tags of the
    form class::func, class::~class, operatorX, where X is an operator,
    and class::operatorX.

    The -m option allows the generation of a <tags> file which will contain
    any tags from the local <hdrtags> file in addition to whatever source code
    files were processed by flist.

    The <rdcolor.dat> file should be moved to the s: directory.  Set the
    environment variable

       setenv ChipData s:

    so that the programs can find it.  The file provides a mapping from color
    names to escape sequences, and it should be fairly obvious as to how to
    modify it to suit your requirements.

    The hdrtag program was compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following
    options: CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8.

    Good luck, and let me know of any problems you encounter, and any attaboys
    will be appreciated :).


New Stuff:

	2.05: New options (and bugfixes, of course) -a, -Amagic, -Ppat and associated -l and -ll, -L.
	2.02: Can generate TAGS files (etags mode)
	      Can merge with hdrtag-generated etags mode files (ie. use -me)
