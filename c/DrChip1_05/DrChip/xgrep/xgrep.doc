Usage

	xgrep {options} {expression | -f patfile} file [file2 [file3 ...]]


Options

    -_: toggle _ as magic character (default: its magic for white space)
    -c: matched lines are counted and reported on
    -C: ignore case of characters (ie. A matches a)
    -f: a file (patfile) contains a list of expressions
	to be used in matching to the files' lines.
    -F: doesn't print out filename being processed
    -i: place "file line#" identifier prior to match
    -I: place "file line#" identifier prior to match
    -l: line numbering enabled
    -p: print out pattern table
    -u: unmatched lines are printed
    -x: exact matches to pattern required
    -h: highlights pattern in printed lines


Explanation

	The xgrep program is used to search using regular expressions
	and (optionally) boolean logic algebra for patterns in lines in
	one or more files.

  expression:	[{lspec}][pattern]
    The "lspec" defines the line specification and pattern is the
    pattern to be looked for in the line.  Note that either or both
    the line spec and pattern are optional, and are explained below.

  lspec: default is {1,$}
      An lspec is optional; it describes which lines will be checked
    for matches to the pattern.  An lspec has one or two parts, and
    either part may be either a (line) number or a pattern, separated
    by a comma.  A lone '$' in a part is a special "number" meaning
    end-of-file.  If the second part is omitted, then it is assumed to
    be the same as the first part.

  pattern: default is null (no pattern)
      The pattern is composed of a string which may either have a
    simple string to be found or may include "magic" characters which
    have special meanings.  In order to remove the special meaning from
    a "magic" character, precede it by a backslash ("\").
    In addition, boolean logic is supported.

  Magic Characters:

    !: if the pattern is not in the line, then the line matches
    &: p1&p2: both patterns (p1 and p2) must be in the line for a match
    |: p1|p2: either pattern (p1 and/or p2) in the line causes a match
    {}: used to specify precedence for boolean logic (ie. like parentheses)
    ?: wildcard - matches any character
    *: matches 0 to any number of the preceding character.  Uses
       backwards context matching; ie. it matches as much
       as possible without context.
    %: matches 0 to any (like *), but uses forward context matching.
       Matches as little as possible without context.
    +: matches 1 to any number of the preceding character
    `: matches 0 to 1 of preceding character
    ~: matches so long as it is not the following character
    [...]: match if the character is any of the characters between the
       braces.  Furthermore, a range such as '[w-z]' may be used.
    #: matches any digit
    @: matches any alphabetic character
    _: matches any white space (ie. like [ \t\n^$] )
    ^: match if matching string is at the beginning of the line
    $: match if matching string is at the end of the line

  Escaped Characters:

       Escaped magic characters (ex. \$) lose their "magic" meaning.
    Most other escaped characters retain their normal meaning.  However,
    the following escaped characters are replaced as follows:

    Escape-Sequence    Result    Escape-Sequence    Result
         \e            escape         \o###          octal char
         \f            formfeed       \t             tab
         \h            backspace      \x##           hexadecimal char
         \n            newline        \A - \Z        control char
    The ##/### digit sequences may have 1-2/1-3 digits.

    The xgrep program was compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following
    options: CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8.

    Good luck, and let me know of any problems you encounter, and any attaboys
    will be appreciated :)
