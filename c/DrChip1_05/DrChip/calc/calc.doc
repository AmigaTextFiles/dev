Explanation

	Computes algebraic arithmetic expressions from the command line
	or, lacking the expression, calc will go into interactive mode.
	Calc can handle user-defined variables, parentheses, and has pi and e
	built-in.

	expression: an arithmetic expression to be evaluated

	More Help: try "? subject", where the subject is
	           examples, help, int, modes, or op

	To ask for help on a function, try "? funcname": eg. ? Expn
	Calc supports various formats for input and output.  Try
	"? modes" for more.

	Finally, in interactive mode: use "q" to quit.

	Functions Available:
	Beta      J         acsc      atan2     cot       incGamma  pow       sqrt    
	E         K         angdiff   atanh     csc       incgamma  q         tan     
	Expn      Y         asec      ceil      exp       ln        sec       tanh    
	F         acos      asin      comb      fabs      lnGamma   sin       todeg   
	GenE      acosh     asinh     cos       floor     log       sinh      torad   
	I         acot      atan      cosh      gamma     perm      

    The calc program was compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following
    options: CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8.

    Good luck, and let me know of any problems you encounter, and any attaboys
    will be appreciated :)
