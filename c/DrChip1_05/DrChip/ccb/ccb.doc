Usage

    ccb [-bBcdfirsv]


Options

    -b:  place a bar between functions
    -B:  replace leading blanks+tabs, not just tabs
    -BB: replace leading tabs and >=3 blanks
    -c:  don't detab case statements by one
    -d:  de-tab close curly
    -f:  don't de-tab functions by one
    -i:  don't use if/do/while/else/for mode

    -s:  save output in *.cb file(s)
    -v:  verbose mode (to stderr)


Explanation

    The ccb program is Dr. Chip's C beautifier program.  It enforces my preferred
    tabbing rules based upon the current number of open curly braces and can shift
    comments and open curly braces around near if, for, else, else if, do, and
    switch statements.  The ccb program has an obvious relationship with the
    *IX cb program, but has a different (default) style.  The default style is, of
    course, Dr. Chip's preference, but can be modified to the "standard" cb
    style with the options "-cdfi".  Naturally, my style is the best! :)

	Caveats: this is version 1.02, and as such it may well have bugs.  It may
	not function with your style of coding, especially if you do funky things
	with the preprocessor.  It has the potential to mess up your code, so:

		*** USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ***

	Normally, the ccb program puts its output onto stdout, so its output can
	be filtered, etc.  However, the -r flag will replace your files with the
	"beautified" code (again: this is dangerous), although the old files will
	be kept with a .bak suffix.  Don't remove your *.bak files until you're
	sure the beautified ones will compile correctly.
    
    Dr. Chip's C beautifier also contains extensions which should enable
    it to work with C++ programs, too.

    The <rdcolor.dat> file should be moved to the s: directory.  Set the
    environment variable

       setenv ChipData s:

    so that the programs can find it.  The file provides a mapping from color
    names to escape sequences, and it should be fairly obvious as to how to
    modify it to suit your requirements.

    The ccb program was compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following
    options: CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8.

    Good luck, and let me know of any problems you encounter, and any attaboys
    will be appreciated :)


New Stuff

	The ccb program has had very few bug fixes and appears pretty stable.
	The main new thing is the "-BB" option, which retains leading 1 or 2
	blanks.
