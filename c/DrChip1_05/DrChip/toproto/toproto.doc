Usage:

    toproto [options] [filename1 [filename2 [filename3...]]
    toproto "?"


Options:

    -b : body of code not printed
    -B : print both prototype and old style
    -Bstring : print both prototype and old style,
         using "string" instead of default __STDC__ in #ifdef test.
    -c : add variable list comments
    -o : make old-style declarations (ie. not prototypes)
    -r : replace file(s) with their new format (dangerous - use at own risk)
    -t type: use next argument as default type
    -v : report on progress (verbose)


Explanation:

    toproto converts C files to a prototype-using format or to old K&R
    style.  The toproto program will leave the old files with a .bak
    extension when the "-r" option is used.  This program is

                *** !!! USE-AT-YOUR-OWN-RISK !!! ***

    It has the potential to destroy your files.  Make sure that the output is
    compilable before deleting the *.bak file(s)!  In particular, funky things done
    with the preprocessor may not be understood properly and can cause deleterious
    behavior.

    The

        toproto "?"

    will give you online help.

    Normally, toproto will send its output to the stdout (screen).  Of course,
    that means that you can redirect it, filter it, etc.  The -r option does
    allow one to replace files with the prototype'd (or K&R'd) form, but
    *PLEASE* be wary of it!  Again: *I am not responsible or liable for any damage
    done by this program*.

    Now that I've said that, I've found toproto highly useful.  It never damages
    *my* source code files, although I've seen it foul up some source issued
    by others (typically, because of funky things done with the preprocessor).

    Those of you who #define BEGIN { and #define END } will find that toproto
    does not work for you.  In fact, any of you who don't use { and } properly
    will find toproto does not work for you.

    It will change <varargs.h> style to <stdarg.h> style (and vice versa):

        <varargs.h> style:              <stdarg.h> style:
        ---------------------------     ------------------------

        int yourfunc(arg1,va_alist)     int yourfunc(sometype arg1,...)
        sometype arg1;
        va_dcl
        {                               {
        va_list args;                   va_list args;
        ...                             ...
        va_start(args);                 va_start(arg1,args);
        ...                             ...
        va_end(args);                   va_end(args);


    The -B flag causes toproto to issue both the new and old style:

        int main(int argc,char **argv)
        {
        }

    becomes

        #ifdef __STDC__
        int main(
          int argc,
          char **argv)
        #else    /* __STDC__ */
        int main(argc,argv)
        int argc;
        char **argv;
        #endif    /* __STDC__ */
        {
        }

    If -Bstring is used, the given string will be used instead of __STDC__.

    Normally, functions without types are assumed to be of type "int".  The
    "-t type" flag allows one to change that default behavior (for example,
    one may wish to use -t void).

    The <rdcolor.dat> file should be moved to the s: directory.  Set the
    environment variable

       setenv ChipData s:

    so that the programs can find it.  The file provides a mapping from color
    names to escape sequences, and it should be fairly obvious as to how to
    modify it to suit your requirements.

    The hdrtag program was compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following
    options: CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8.

    Good luck, and let me know of any problems you encounter, and any attaboys
    will be appreciated :).
