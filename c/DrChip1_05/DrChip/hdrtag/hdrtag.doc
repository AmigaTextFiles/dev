Version: 2.06


Usage:

    hdrtag [-options] {*.h | directory-names}
    hdrtag "?"


Options:

    -a: use antimagic on patterns
    -Amagic: specify "magic" characters for antimagic
    -e: generates "almost" etags in <hdrtags>
    -g: tag global variables, prototypes, etc
    -h: restrict hdrtag processing to *.h files
    -m: merge hdrtags with tags
    -M: merge hdrtags with current hdrtags
    -p: c++ mode: tag global variables, prototypes, etc
    -r: permit recursive descent down directories (ie. do subdirectories, too)
    -s: system header file handler (fixed, static files)
    -v: verbose mode
    -x: toggle exclude duplicates (default is to exclude)


Explanation

    The hdrtag program examines header files and creates a <hdrtags> file with
    <tags>-style information on how to tag to

        structure names
        typedefs
        #define labels
        enum names
        enumerated types

    and optionally (-g) to

        global variables
        prototype function names
        and anything which is not a C or C++ keyword.

    Examples of use:
        cd include:                 # go to your compiler's header files
        hdrtags -garvh include:     # generate a <hdrtags> file
        rename hdrtags tags         # editors use <tags>, not <hdrtags>
        vim -t ARG0                 # go to the file & line where ARG0 is defined
        vim -t putc                 # go find the prototype for putc
        vim -t BPTR                 # go to the file & line wher BPTR is defined

    Note that editors (ViM, Z, emacs) use a <tags> file, so hdrtag can optionally
    merge the hdrtags into a pre-existing tags file instead using the -m option.
    
    Alternatively, one may use the flist program with its -m option generate a
    <tags> file and to merge a pre-existing <hdrtags> file into it.  This latter
    method is probably the more useful of the two.
    
    Not all editors use magic characters during tags processing.  ViM, for example,
    only uses a subset of magic characters when it handles tags (ex. the asterisk
    is not magic when its handling tags).  The antimagic facility allows one to
    customize hdrtag's handling of magic characters.

    The antimagic facility inserts backslashes (\) before "magic" characters.
    The default set of magic characters is: ^$.[]|\ .  If your favorite program
    needs a different set of magic characters, two methods are provided:

        1) use the -Astring (or -A string) option, where the string is your set
           of magic characters

        2) set an environment variable, HDRTAGMAGIC, to the magic characters
           your favorite editor needs in tag files.

    The hdrtag program will give help with
        hdrtag "?"

    For those of you with Aztec C or SAS C, the include: directory hierarchy
    holds your header files.  I suggest using

        hdrtag -garvh include:

    to process the header files therein.  Doing so, however, will take up over
    3MB of ram.  Afterwards, one may wish to

        rename hdrtags tags

    and leave the file in the include: directory.  Over 5500 tags will result!
    I'd distribute the resulting tags files myself, but SAS informs me that there
    may be copyright problems with Commodore.  So, please do *not* distribute
    the tags files you generate from the include: hierarchy.

    Options are not restricted to appearing at the beginning.  The hdrtag program
    will examine all command line arguments first and process those beginning
    with '-' as options.  One may concatenate arguments (ie. -garvh) or separate
    them (ie. -ga -v -rh).  Options may also be specified with a leading '+'
    which will be processed in sequence with the other arguments
    (ie. hdrtag -a one.h +g two.h).

    The -s flag may or may not be useful to you.  On *IX systems, the vi editor
    can tag not only to search strings (/some string where the tagged info is),
    but can tag to a line number.  Obviously, the latter tagline is rather shorter,
    thereby conserving file space and improving tagging times.  Since line
    numbers are used, however, the header files so processed should be more or
    less static, and system header files fit this bill nicely.

    The <rdcolor.dat> file should be moved to the s: directory.  Set the
    environment variable

       setenv ChipData s:

    so that the programs can find it.  The file provides a mapping from color
    names to escape sequences, and it should be fairly obvious as to how to
    modify it to suit your requirements.

    The hdrtag program was compiled with Aztec C on an A3000 with the following
    options: CCOPTS=-qf -wp -c2 -f8.

    Good luck, and let me know of any problems you encounter, and any attaboys
    will be appreciated :)

New Stuff

	2.06:
	Hdrtag now supports etags-style tagging.  Using the -e option, it creats
	<hdrtags> using an almost-etags style; "flist -me" will finish the job,
	creating a <TAGS> file.

	Hdrtag now also supports *.y (yacc, bison) files, tagging productions,
	%left/%right operators, %types, etc.

	Hdrtag now prioritizes tags internally: typedefs have high priority,
	prototypes have low priority, etc.  Prioritization affects the order
	that (ctags-style) tags will appear; excluding duplicates (the default
	behavior) will cause only the highest priority tag to be retained.

	Bugs have been squashed, of course.
