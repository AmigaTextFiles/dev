		   Resource Tracking Library V0.1

		 (C) 1994, Aaron "Optimizer" Digulla


 OVERVIEW
 --------

One of the major advantages of the Amiga is that the OS does not track
resources. This is one of the main reasons that the OS is so fast and small
(the other is that many parts have been written in assembler).

    While this is great for the user (he needs only few RAM and small
harddisks), the situation is quite different for programmers. While the
user has no need nor intention to make mistakes that may crash the machine
(he is guided by a more or less bug-free software that does not allow him
to do dangerous things like calling functions with wrong arguments), this
is exactly what the developer does. So for developing software, resource
tracking is a must be.

    Several tools were and are lurking around which allow to track and/or
protect resources (like Enforcer, Mungwall, SnoopDos and DosTrace), there
is none that work likes the OS under UNIX which frees all allocated
resources after the program exited or crashed. And this is where RTL comes
into play.

    The resource tracking library (RTL) is a link library with the following
features:

    - Resource tracking only for the program you are developing right now
      and only where you need it. This saves as much speed and resources
      as possible.
    - You can check the currently used resources at any time.
    - Not only the creation and disposal of resources is checked but also
      the usage. If you, for example, lock a file and the duplicate the
      lock, the argument to DupLock() is checked and the return value
      of DupLock is tracked, too.
    - Gives a list of all still allocated resources at the end of the
      program.
    - All messages come show the file and line where the resource was
      allocated or a function was called with illegal parameters.
    - Source is included :-)

For a list of all currently tracked resources, have a look into restack.h.

For debugging, RTL offers the following functions:

    StartResourceTracking - Begin resource tracking for a specified list of
		resources (no need to track when we know it works).
    SetResourceTracking - Change the tracked resources.
    PrintTrackedResources - Print a list of all known resources.
    SetResourceTrackingLevel - Temporarily disable/enable all resource
		tracking.
    IncResourceTrackingLevel/DecResourceTrackingLevel - Same as
		SetResourceTrackingLevel, but can be nested
    EndResourceTracking - Stop resource tracking and free everything that's
		still allocated.
