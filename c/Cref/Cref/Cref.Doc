  cref - C cross referencer

This program reads C source from its standard input or one or more files
and prints the source code with line numbers followed by an alphabetic
list of  word references by line number.

To run:
    cref [-q] [-lnnn] [-wnnn] [-hheading] [-tnnn] [-?] [file ...]

Options:
    q    - don't print normal input file listing.

    lnnn - set page length to n instead of the default 66.
            Minimum allowed is 4, maximum is 9999.

    wnnn - set page width to n instead of the default 132.
            Minimum allowed is 27, maximum is 132.

    hccc - set page heading to 'ccc' rather than file names.

    tnnn - set tab spaces to n instead if the default 8.
            Minimum is 1, maximum is 132.
     ?    - display this list.

This program was written by Mike Edmonds for use on Unix. It was ported
to the Amiga by Joel Swank. The original UNIX source is included for
the sake of completeness.
