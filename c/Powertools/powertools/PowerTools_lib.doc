    The PowerTools package (lib, includes and docs) are public domain
    and freely distributable. Anyone who programs the Amiga may use
    the PowerTools code for commercial or PD software. A small note in
    the documentation of your software would be appreciated, though.

    What is PowerTools?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The PowerTools.lib is a standard Amiga linker-library that contains
    some handy and easy to use C-coded functions. The functions were
    developed and elaborated in a series of programs that I made.
    Because the functions increased the compilation time considerably,
    I thought it was a good idea to put them away in a library.
    This library will grow bigger as I have new and good functions to
    put into it. You can see it as a sort of amiga.lib.

    Although most functions in this lib already exist in other (shared)
    libraries, the versions in my lib are easier to use, and very powerful
    too. In fact, this lib uses the existing code in other libraries but
    it also makes the necessary memory allocations and initializations.
    So, you don't have to bother anymore on opening libraries, closing
    them, declaring structures, filling them in, etc...

    The functions in the lib are designed to make efficient use of the
    available libraries (e.g. PowerTools.lib uses Kickstart 3.0 features
    if available). Some functions allow you to prefer ReqTools routines
    without being dependant of ReqTools (if ReqTools calls fail, standard
    system routines will be used). This allows you to create very flexible
    and intelligent programs.


    How to use PowerTools?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Currently, PowerTools can only be used within C-programming environ-
    ments. If anyone knows how to make PowerTools available to other
    programming languages, please contact me.

    Simply #include the PowerTools.h file (should be placed in INCLUDE:-
    directory) in your C-source. It contains all definitions and prototypes
    to use PowerTools.lib.
    After that, you can call the PowerTools.lib functions like any other C-
    function. Just pass the right parameters and collect the (optional)
    return code, PowerTools does the rest!

    After compilation, you must link your program object with the
    PowerTools.lib file. If you use the PT_USERT flag with the PowerTools
    functions, you must also link the reqtools.lib (together with
    PowerTools.lib) with your program. The reqtools development package is
    available from Nico François directly, or from various PD collections.
    The linker (from your C-development package) will attach all used
    PowerTools (and ReqTools) functions to your program. Now you can test
    your program and see if everything works as you expected.

    PowerTools.lib opens all it's needed libraries itself, and closes them
    when they aren't needed anymore. This means you don't have to take care
    of opening and closing libraries for PowerTools, but it also means that
    you may *NOT* rely on the libraries PowerTools opened (because PowerTools
    may close them without any notice). If you use the same libraries as
    PowerTools, you should open (and close) them yourself, for private use.
    The only libraries PowerTools expects to be open are the exec.library and
    the dos.library. Both of them should have been opened by the startup-code
    anyway.

PowerTools.lib/pt_BusyPointer   PowerTools.lib/pt_BusyPointer
  NAME  
    pt_BusyPointer -- Intelligent busypointer function (V1)

  SYNOPSIS
    pt_BusyPointer (window,state);

    void pt_BusyPointer (struct Window *,BOOL);

  DESCRIPTION
    First checks if running under OS 3.0. If intuition.library V39++ could
    be opened, pt_BusyPointer uses the Workbench busypointer (user defined).
    If OS 3.0 check is negative, this function checks for the presents of
    reqtools.library (any version) and uses its rtSetWaitPointer() function.
    If this doesn't work, the function returns without changing the pointer.
    Window input is blocked by opening an invisible requester on it (V2).

  INPUTS
    window - a pointer to the window that should be (un)blocked for mouse input.
    state - TRUE to block input, FALSE to unblock.

  NOTE
    Don't forget to call this function twice: the first time to block input and,
    very important, the second time to UNBLOCK the input.

  BUGS
    No busypointer when no intuition.library V39 or reqtools.library
    available. No info on this.

PowerTools.lib/pt_SimpleRequest   PowerTools.lib/pt_SimpleRequest
  NAME
    pt_SimpleRequest -- Very easy to use system requester (V1)

  SYNOPSIS
    num = pt_SimpleRequest (window,title,textformat,gadgetformat,flags);

    LONG pt_SimpleRequest(struct Window *,STRPTR,STRPTR,STRPTR,WORD); 

  DESCRIPTION
    This function allocates, interprets and frees everything necessary to
    display a system-requester. If you set the PT_USERT flag,
    pt_SimpleRequest() opens a ReqTools-requester. Otherwise, intuition
    will be used. This function supports multigadget requesters (any number
    of gadgets) and a C-style formatted text string (without arguments).

  INPUTS
    window - a pointer to the window the requester should appear on. If you
             pass NULL, the requester opens on the default public screen.
    title - pointer to a title string.
    textformat - C-style formatted string with the body text 
                 (e.g.. "Hello World!\nThis is an example...").
    gadgetformat - string containing all gadgetlabels, each label separated
                   by a '|'-symbol (e.g. "OK|Maby|Cancel").
    flags - Currently supported flags:

            PT_USERT: Set if you want reqtools.library to be used.
                      If this fails, the function will fall back
                      on intuition (which should work always...)

  RESULT
    Number of gadget that was selected. Note the strange numbering:
    From left to right, the gadgets return number 1, 2, etc.
    The utmost right gadget (the "Cancel" gadget) returns number 0.

  NOTE
    This function calls pt_BusyPointer() internally if window ~= NULL.

PowerTools.lib/pt_FileRequest   PowerTools.lib/pt_FileRequest
  NAME
    pt_FileRequest -- Very easy to use file requester (V1)

  SYNOPSIS
    ret = pt_FileRequest (window,title,pathbuffer,pattern,flags);

    BOOL pt_FileRequest(struct Window *,STRPTR,UBYTE *,STRPTR,WORD); 

  DESCRIPTION
    This function allocates, interprets and frees everything necessary to
    display a filerequester. If you set flags to PT_USERT , pt_FileRequest
    opens a ReqTools-requester. Otherwise, an Asl-requester will be used.

  INPUTS
    window - a pointer to the window the requester should appear on. If you
             pass NULL, the requester opens on the default public screen.
    title - pointer to a title string.
    pathbuffer - pointer to a stringbuffer which should be at least 108 
                 bytes long
    pattern - pointer to a string that contains a pattern to be used
              in the file-requester. NULL if no pattern required.
    flags - Currently supported flags:

            PT_USERT: Set if you want reqtools.library to be used.
                      If this fails, the function will fall back
                      on asl (hope this works !).

            PT_SAVEMODE: Set if the requester is used for a save or
                         write operation (strongly advised!).

  RESULT
    TRUE if user selected OK (string in pathbuffer is valid), FALSE
    if user canceled requester (do not use pathbuffer contents !).

  NOTE
    The allocation and length of the buffers are completely your
    responsibility ! Buffers of less the 108 bytes may lead to serious
    memory trashing (and machine crashing)!!

  BUGS
    No filerequester when reqtools.library and asl.library are not
    available. No info on this.

PowerTools.lib/pt_SplitPath   PowerTools.lib/pt_SplitPath
  NAME
    pt_SplitPath -- Break a path into a dirname and a filename (V1)

  SYNOPSIS
    pt_SplitPath (path,directorybuffer,filenamebuffer);

    void pt_Splitpath(STRPTR,UBYTE *,UBYTE *); 

  DESCRIPTION
    This function splits a given path into a directoryname and a filename.
    The two name-strings will be copied into the directory and filename
    buffers.

  INPUTS
    path - pointer to a legal AmigaDOS path string. (e.g. the one that
           pt_FileRequest creates in your pathbuffer)
    directorybuffer - pointer to a directory buffer which should be at
                      least 108 bytes long.
    filenamebuffer - pointer to a filename buffer which should be at
                     least 108 bytes long.

  NOTE
    The allocation and length of the buffers are completely your
    responsibility ! Buffers of less the 108 bytes may lead to serious
    memory trashing (and machine crashing)!!

PowerTools.lib/pt_AllocProgress   PowerTools.lib/pt_AllocProgress
  NAME
    pt_AllocProgress -- Allocate, initialize and render progress indicator (V1)

  SYNOPSIS
    progress = pt_AllocProgress (window,xcoord,ycoord,width,height,max,flags);

    struct pt_Progress *
         pt_AllocProgress(struct Window *,UWORD,UWORD,UWORD,UWORD,LONG,UWORD);

  DESCRIPTION
    This function allocates an pt_Progress structure, fills is with the init-
    values and renders a progress indicator in the window according to the
    guidelines in the Amiga User Interface Style Guide (Commodore-Amiga).
    It returns a pointer to the pt_Progress structure for the indicator.

  INPUTS
    window - a pointer to the window the indicator should render in.
    xcoord - X-coordinate of the indicator box. Note that before the box
             a "0% " string will be rendered (leave enough space !).
    ycoord - Y-coordinate of the indicator box.
    width - width of the indicator box. Note that after the box
             a " 100%" string will be rendered (leave enough space !).
    height - height of the indicator box.
    max - maximum level for indicator (= total = 100%), e.g. the total size
          of a file, the total estimated time for a job. This value will
          be used to scale the progress indicator level while updating.
    flags - not used, for future enhancements. Currently always NULL.

  RESULT
    A pointer to an initialized pt_Progress structure. This structure
    contains everything the pt_UpdateProgress() function must know
    to adjust the level in the indicator. All fields in this structure are
    private (and subject of change in future) and may only be changed by
    the specific PowerTools functions.

  BUGS
    Rendering is based on topaz.8 font and this font is considered as the
    default screen font (and this is not always the case under Release 2++).

PowerTools.lib/pt_UpdateProgress   PowerTools.lib/pt_UpdateProgress
  NAME
    pt_UpdateProgress -- Display progress (update) in a progress indicator (V1)

  SYNOPSIS
    pt_UpdateProgress (progress,progressvalue);

    void pt_UpdateProgress(struct pt_Progress *,LONG);

  DESCRIPTION
    Use this function to keep the progress indicator up-to-date. According
    to the progress value you pass, pt_UpdateProgress will render the
    portion of the job that has been processed (in % scale).
    You can call this function at any time, as much as you want. I advise
    you, though, not to call this function after every time a tiny bit of the
    job has been completed. The update routines performs a few (heavy) float
    calculations which require some processor time. I suppose you don't want
    your program calculating on the updating all the time, instead of working
    on your job. A periodic call to this function during the processing of
    the time consuming job should not slow down the performing of your
    program, however.

  INPUTS
    progress - pointer to the pt_Progress structure of the indicator.
               pt_UpdateProgress() will update some fields of the struct.
    progressvalue - the absolute amount of the job already finished. This
                    value must always increase (with every call to this
                    function) until it finaly equals to the max value passed
                    in the pt_AllocProgress() function.

  SYNOPSIS
    pt_FreeProgress (progress,flags);

    void pt_FreeProgress(struct pt_Progress *,UWORD);

  DESCRIPTION
    When you do not need the progress indicator anymore, you MUST call this
    function to free all the memory pt_AllocProgress allocated.

  INPUTS
    progress - pointer to the pt_Progress structure of the indicator.
    flags - not used, for future enhancements. Currently always NULL.

  SYNOPSIS
    listreq = pt_AllocListRequest(window,font,flags);

    struct pt_ListRequest *
         pt_AllocListRequest(struct Window *,struct TextAttr *,UWORD);

  DESCRIPTION
    Allocates and initializes a pt_ListRequest data structure for you.

  INPUTS
    window - pointer to the parent window (you must supply this !).
    font - font to render ListRequest (NULL is not safe!).
    flags - not used, for future enhancements. Currently always NULL.

  RESULT
    A pointer to an initialized pt_ListRequest structure. This structure
    must be passed to the pt_ListRequest() function. It is safe to read/
    write the fields in the struct.

  SEE ALSO
    pt_ListRequest(), pt_FreeListRequest()
PowerTools.lib/pt_ListRequest   PowerTools.lib/pt_ListRequest
  NAME
    pt_ListRequest -- Get input from user via ListRequester (V2)

  SYNOPSIS
    item = pt_ListRequest(listreq,title,list,flags);

    WORD pt_ListRequest(struct pt_ListRequest *,STRPTR,struct MinList *,UWORD);


  DESCRIPTION
    Opens a ListRequester presenting a list of possible choises to the user.
    This function returns when the users makes a choice (returncode >= 0)
    or cancels it (returncode = -1). pt_ListRequest() uses pt_BusyPointer()
    to block all input for the parent Window. It also uses the parent Window
    to find the Screen to open on. The ListRequester is sizeable and font-
    sensitive.

  INPUTS
    listreq - pointer to an initialized pt_ListRequest structure.
    title - title string.
    list - pointer to a valid MinList structure to display in the
           requester.
    flags - not used, for future enhancements. Currently always NULL.

  RESULT
    Ordinal number of selected item (starting from zero) or -1 if requester
    failed or canceled by user. The selected item (struct node *) can be
    found in the listreq->lr_node field.
