Building programs
-----------------

The most work will done by rules from the MAKE-Dir.
Don't search for a doc-file, there isn't one.
Look IN the file that included in make. The full
documentation can be find there.
You find a subdir, called democonfig_eng in
make. Copy the file one dir up to make and
delete the empty dir. It is only build for
copying. The original files in make work full
identical but the documentation is german.

best work:
first read the doc-files (and understand).
second go to the make-dir and have a look
on the files.
If you understand how Pmm work take a
SMALL program and include it in make.
Best is, make a backup of make bevor do
any changes.
Aftes all things work correctly, do
source by source to pmm. Test every program
that will included same time you put it
in the project.
