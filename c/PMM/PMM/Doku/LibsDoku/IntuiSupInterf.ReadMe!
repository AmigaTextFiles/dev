Here is the interface modules to use the Intuisup library (v4.5) from 
Torsten Jürgeleit with the MSCS Modula II compiler.
I use the same names as the original 'Intuisup.h' file, I test all 
the functions of the library and found no problem, but if you find 
something wrong with these modules please tell me about it.
The comments are still in spanish, sorry.
