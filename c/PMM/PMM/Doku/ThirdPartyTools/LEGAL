There are many other authors with own copyright's to the included
tools, library's and documents.

You will find the copyrights in the docs.

I created all linklibs, that say not, I've wrote the source!

STRING_xxx.lib and ADOS_xxx.lib are really linklibs. Parts
are ported from various places (most Unix), other part are
written by myself.

SUPRA_xxx.lib and MEM_xxx.lib are only ported to vbcc by me.

MMU_xxx.lib, PPC_xxx.lib, IntuiSup_xxx.lib, MetaXpr_xxx.lib
and ReqTools_xxx.lib are only stubs-libs, used by myself build
with the Pmm-scripts you will find in this package.

Gateway_xxx.lib is also a stubs-lib for my own, included
gateway.library.

Tools: All programs in bin are from other authors, look for
the docs and copyrights!

The folders from 68000 upto wos in bin are my work and my
programs. You will find version for all 68k. The ppc- and
wos-versions are not available at this time. Every part that
works will be included at same time.

There are many other authors. First I've begin a list with
copyrights and with part the wrote.
It's to big. Please check out the docs for info's.

I only will say:
----------------
Thank all the authors for the many good shareware on the best
computer in past, today and (hope so) future.
Thanks to the hardware customers that supports the Amiga in
the years after Commodore.

And also thanks to Bill Gates for show us how to do it not!
