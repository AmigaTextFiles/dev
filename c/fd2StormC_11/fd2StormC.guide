fd2StormC.rexx, Version 1.1

This little ARexx script saves you a lot of time.
It creates a pragma-file for the Storm-C/C++ Compiler from any given FD-file.
In this Version, ugly errors have now been fixed...

Installation:

  Copy fd2StormC.rexx whereever you want.
  A good place e.g. is the rexx-directory on your system partition.

@node "Usage" "Usage"
Usage:

  First, be sure to be in the same directory where the fd-file is located.
  This is important, because some of the generated output relies on the
  given FD-filename. (have a look in the generated pragma-file...)

  Call fd2StormC from shell like this:

    rx rexx:fd2StormC.rexx <fd-filename without path>

  FD-filename should look like: dummy_lib.fd,
  the prototype-filename should be: dummy_protos.h,

  the pragma-filename will be: dummy_pragmas.h

@node "Bugs" "Bugs"
Bugs:

Things go really wrong, if the contents of an FD-file are corrupt or
non conform. In this case, I can do nothing at all...

But there is another problem: most private library functions
are labeled 'private1()','private2()', etc...
This causes the Storm-C/C++ compiler to moan about the resulting pragmas.
Simply put a comment around them, as they are private and should not be used.
