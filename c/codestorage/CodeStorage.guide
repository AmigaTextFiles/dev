@NODE "Main"  "Code Storage (c) documentation:"

   @{B}Code Storage@{UB} is a program designed to allow programmers to store
   their code in a data base & retrieve it in pieces in order to 
   avoid writing the same functions over & over again.
   
   Here is a list of the help available for this program:

   @{" Startup       " LINK "startup"} -- Running the System. 
   @{" Requirements  " LINK "requirement"} -- What do you need?
   @{" Configuration " LINK "DiskConfig"} -- Directory Storage. 
   @{" Warranty      " LINK "warranty"} -- (Are you kidding?) 
   @{" Distribution  " LINK "distribution"}
   @{" ToolTypes     " LINK "tooltypes"} -- Hurray, Someone who uses them!
   @{" Author        " LINK "Author"} -- Who is this Guy?

   @{" Logo          " LINK CodeStorageLogo.iff/main} -- The program Logo.   

@ENDNODE

@NODE "startup" "Running the system:"
@PREV Main

  The CodeStorage system is invoked by typing the command @{B}CodeStorage@{UB}
  or by clicking on the CodeStorage icon.
  The program will open its own windows on the workbench.  Using the 
  @{" ToolTypes " LINK "ToolTypes"} stored in the icon, the program will load whatever DataBase
  is specified by the @{B}CurrentDataBase@{UB} ToolType.

  After the program is done setting up, the small @{"Logo" LINK CodeStorageLogo.iff/main} Display will close
  & the main GUI window will open, where the Records of your functions
  can be entered, edited, sorted & searched for.

  The program consists of the following CanDo (c) cards:
  
  @{" TitleCard " LINK "titlecard"} -- The Logo Display window.   
  @{" MainCard  " LINK "maincard"} -- Where you'll spend most of your time.
  @{" AboutCard " LINK "aboutinfo"} -- Brief information window.   
  
  @{" ToolTypesEditor " LINK "ToolTypesEditor"} -- Change the ToolTypes.
  @{" MaintenanceCard " LINK "Maintenance"} -- DataBase HouseKeeping.   

@ENDNODE

@NODE titlecard "The Logo Display window:"
@PREV startup

   This window displays my program @{"logo" LINK CodeStorageLogo.iff/main} until the program is ready to
   continue with the main part of the program @{FG SHINE}(how groovy!)@{FG TEXT}.

   This is where the ToolTypes setup the program.

@ENDNODE
   
@NODE "maincard" "Where you'll spend most of your time:"
@PREV startup

   This window is the main GUI for running the program.  From here you
   can enter records, delete records, edit them, sort them & search for
   particular records.  Most of the gadgetry is self-explanatory, except
   for the @{B}Update Record@{UB} gadget & the two little arrow gadgets surrounding
   the @{I}Record #:@{UI} display.

   When you press & release the @{B}Update Record@{UB} gadget, all of the changes
   (if any), that you've made in the string & listview gadgets are
   used to update the Record in the program's memory.
@{FG SHINE}   
   WARNING:  There is no Undo gadget here, so be careful. @{FG TEXT}
     
   The arrow keys allow you to page through the records in the Current
   database.  The left arrow shows the Previous record, while the right
   arrow shows the Next record.  
@{FG SHINE}   
   WARNING:@{FG TEXT}  If you press & release these arrow gadgets before you press
             & release the @{B}Update Record@{UB} gadget, any changes you've made
             to the displayed record will @{B}NOT@{UB} be saved in memory.

   There are no restrictions on how large the Function Code or the
   Function Documentation can be in size; however, if you wish to make
   use of the translation to DBase III (when implemented) menuitems on
   the @{" Maintenance Card, " LINK "Maintenance"} Make sure that the Function Code & the Function
   Documentation are less than 4096 characters long.  This is a limitation
   imposed by DBase III.
      
   @{" Menus " LINK "MainMenus"} -- What do the menus do?

   @{B}DISTRIBUTION
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~@{UB}
   This software package is @{B}ShareWare@{UB}. It may be put on any
   media which is used for the distribution of ShareWare, like Public
   Domain disk collections, CDROMs or FTP servers.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package, distributors
   should use the complete original distribution. The author cannot be held
   responsible if this software has become unusable due to modifications
   of the distribution contents or of the distribution files themselves.
   There is no limit on the costs of the distribution, e.g. for the media,
   like floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact disks, or the process of
   duplicating.  Such limits have been proven to be harmful to the idea of
   shareware, i.e., instead of reducing the price of the
   floppy disk below the limit, the software was simply removed from the
   master disk.

   Although the @{" Author " LINK Author} does not impose any limit on the 
   distribution of this software, he would like to express his personal 
   opinions on this matter:

   * This software package should be made available to everyone free of
     charge whenever it is possible (so they can send me money instead ;)).

   * If you have acquired this software package under normal conditions
     from a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk at a price higher than
     US $5, then you have definitely paid too much.  Please don't
     support this improper profit making any longer and switch to a
     less expensive source as soon as possible.
