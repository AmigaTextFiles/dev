General Description

    StripIt is a programmers tool.
    StripIt simply strips all  kinds  of  comments  from  Source  Codes.
    StripIt can handle all kinds of programming languages.
    StripIt needs OS 2.xx to run. It is not able to run under
    Kickstart 1.2 and 1.3.

Features

    StripIt  [SI]  is  configurable  for  all   kinds   of   programming
    languages through its configuration file.

    SI is relatively fast und easy to use.
    ( Not like stripc of Manx etc.).

    SI can be stopped at each time simply by ^C. No loosing data.

    You can specify multiples Source Codes at  once.  In  this  case  SI
    first strips then and then copies it to the Destination.

    StripIt is a OS 2.xx only Tool, that means it is much  shorter  than
    tools which supports OS 1.3 and 2.xx.


Using StripIt

    You need StripIt if you want to strip all  comments  e.g.  from  the
    Include-Files. This results in a much more shorter  compiling  time.

    Or you want to strip comments from old sources. Then you could strip
    the comments manually, which could be work for a live,  or  you  can
    alternatively  use  StripIt  which  takes  only   a   few   seconds.

System Requirements

    You need at least OS 2.xx Version  37.  Version  36  may  have  some
    problems because some functions which SI uses, was in  this  version
    not fully implemented.


Legal Stuff:


        This  program  and  all files come with it, also the docfiles,
        are released as FREEWARE.

        this means:

            everybody may use StripIt,

            everybody may copy StripIt, if:

                1. You copy all included files, see list at the end of the
                   doc file.
                2. No changes are made,  this  means  the  program and all
                   included files must stay in the original form.
                   Exception: you  may  archieve  it; but in this case you
                              must also archieve the whole package.
                3. If  you  recompile  it, you have to include a notice to
                   the original author. If you also want to (re)distribute
                   in any new form you have to send me a copy.
                4. You may not sell StripIt.
                   Execption: you`re  allowed  to  take  a  small copy fee
                              which should not extend 5US$.
                5. If you want to include StripIt
                   or one of the  included files as a part of a commercial
                   package,  you  must  have  written  permission  of  the
                   author (address see below).


        I take no warranty or garanty for the function of this program.
        The whole risk of using StripIt stays only by the user.



Installation

    The best is to copy StripIt to the directory where you have put your
    compiler, linker, etc.

    In each case it should be located in the AmigaDOS searchpath.


Cli-Syntax

    StripIt can only be called via CLI. It has the following options:


SYNTAX: Stripit [SRC/M/A][TO/A][Cfg/K][C/S]

with

        SRC/M/A         SRC is the name of your Source  Codes(s),  which
                        should  be   stripped   from   their   comments.
                        You can specify multiples Sources but  you  must
                        at least specify one.
                        Therefor you must take care  bot  to  forget  to
                        specify  also  a  destination.  Else  the   last
                        Source-File is taken as  destination  und  would
                        be overwritten. BE CAREFUL


        TO/A            TO is the name  of  the  destenation.  You  must
                        specify TO. If you specify multiple Source-Files,
                        the comments from all files will be deleted  and
                        append  to  TO.  Much  equal  the  Join-command.
                        You cannot specify the same file for SRC and TO.
                        In this case  the  file  could  be  overwritten.

        CFG/K           If you type CFG  following  by  the  name  of  a
                        configuration file  StripIt  use  this  file  as
                        configuration. About syntax  of  this  file  see
                        below. This  file  contains  all  comment  chars
                        which should be deleted from SRC(s).

        C/S             Is c is given StriPIt uses an intern configuration
                        which knows all C-comments like
                        /* , */ , // . The `//` are supported for  ANSI-
                        compatibility. All chars after a // are  handled
                        as comment until an `EndOfLine' appears.


Configuration File

    StripIt knows two different kinds of comments.

1.  The first is a comment that startet with  a  string  and  ends  with
    another different string. All between this two strings are  comment.

    e.g.:

                  /* : Is a start of a C-comment
                  */ : Is the end of a C-comment

                  /* And this too */ This not

    equal exists in other programming languages too

TAKE CARE: StripIt doesn`t support comments in comments

         e.g.
                 '/* Hello /* Comment 2 */    */'

       will get an error, because StripIt only waits for the end of the
       comment. You will get something like:

                 '                            */'


2.  The scond kind of comment starts  with  a  string  and  ends  by  an
    EndOfLine.

    e.g.

                   ;   : All behind this char is a comment
                   *   : This could be a comment in Assembler
                   ;   : there are comments in AmigaDOS-scripts too
                   REM : Also in BASIC are comments allowed

I didn`t want to handle all kinds of comments of all kinds of languages.
So I take the advantage of a full user-configurable config file.

So you can still use StripIt with new languages.

To differ the two kinds of comments the config file has the following
syntax:

.sta ##
.end ##
.lin ##

Instead of ## you must specify the comment keys

.sta means: The string behind .sta represents the  start  of  a  comment

.end means: The string behind .end  represents  the  end  of  a  comment

that means: .sta ## must always be followed by  an  .end  ##  statement,
            else you can lose datas.

.lin means: The string behind .lin  represents  a  ToEndOfLine  comment.
            If StripIt finds this statement in a source code  all  chars
            until EndOfLine wil be deleted.

You can use upto 10 (!) different comment statements.

This should be enough for all kinds of sources.

I have a few (most simply) example config files included in the examples
directory. There are examples  for  Batch-,Csh-,Dme-,ASM-  etc  comments
included.


Technical

               StripIt  uses  a  lot  of  new  OS  2.xx  features,   for
               commandline parsing and outputs etc.
               Besides StripIt has get rather  big.  This  is  a  result
               at the on hand of the complexibility ( full  configurable
               interal C-comments-support etc.)
               on the other hand of secuity functions (  Break  Handling
               etc.). So StripIt can be stopped at any  time  simply  by
               typing a ^C. Before SI ends it first  closes  all  opened
               files and gives back all allocated resources.
               The more comment statements are used the more  time  will
               be used to strip the comments. If using all 10 statements
               and very large source files it can take a  lot  of  time.
               In this case you should run StripIT as a  backgound  task
               and sets its priority to something like -1.


Last

               I hope StripIt will be used by a lot of people.
               If you find some bugs please let me know.
               Also seriously critic and/or ideas are wellcomed.
