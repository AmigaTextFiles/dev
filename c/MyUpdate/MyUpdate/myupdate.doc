Format:        MYUPDATE [-C][-I][-S][-V] <source> <destination>

Template:      MYUPDATE "-C/S,-I/S,-S/S,-V/S,SOURCE/A,DESTINATION/A"

Purpose:       To update workbench disks with system software


Specification:

MYUPDATE without any switches will copy a file from the source directory
to the destination directory only if the file exists in the destination
directory. It is designed to update software within a workbench disk without
increasing the number of existing files on customized workbench disks. If
the -C switch is used, the command will copy files from the source to
the destination directories without checking for the existence of the
destination file. If the -I switch is used, the command will run in
interactive mode and query you before each file is updated. If the
-S switch is used the file will be stripped of unnecessary whitespace
as it is copied to the destination directory. Its primary use is for
updating and stripping C language include files. The -V switch is used to
put the command into verbose mode and notify you as each file is updated.
All the switches may be used together or separately to achieve the desired
effects.


Examples:

MYUPDATE df1:c df0:c

updates files that exist in df0:c with files from df1:c.

MYUPDATE -c -s -v df1:include df0:include
      or
MYUPDATE -csv df1:include df0:include

copies and strips files from df1:include to df0:include without checking for
the existence of the destination file. The command will notify you as each
file is processed.
