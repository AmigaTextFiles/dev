The following is a utility that I wrote to update my C workbench disk
whenever Commodore would update my operating system software. It can be
used to create a new disk as well. It differs from the update command that
Commodore provides in that it can strip C header files of comments and
unnecessary whitespace. It compiles under lattice C with a simple
cc -o update myupdate.c
