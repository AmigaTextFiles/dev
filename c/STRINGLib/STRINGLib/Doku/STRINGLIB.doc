StringLib.ReadMe is a original poster and text taken from the
Fred Fish-puplic domain series. These sources build the biggest
part of the link-library. Own sources an source-codes that be
declared as freeware are added.
The various authors all wrote with own specials. One uses
char, another ubyte and third UBYTE.
I've make the source more conform. Based on the oldest codes now
all strings are char.
The vbcc-compiler find a lot of 'const' declared variables that
not real used as const. This warnings all be corrected, two errors
also be corrected. This are the only changes that be made on the
source. My own sources work with special includes, created to
make the building of the bbs-system simple. In this collection
the sources don't do that to work like standard-stringfunctions.

After this, I build the lib and compile the strings(3)-testsystem.
A problem will be found at memchr - test 9. I don't know the
reason of this error. As I take a lock in the source, I killed
the most lines, obtimize the rest and rebuild all. The problem
not longer exists.

The source of 'teststringlib.c' is included.
First version: Works on the internal functionnames of the lib.
This will be work with and without stringfunctions of your
compiler. As second comes a version 'testvbcc.c'. I exclude
all tests of function's that not exist on vbcc.

The test found problems that will be send by me to Volker
Barthelmann to check it. I've included the testprogram.
Ignore the error's, they are NOT real errors. Only problems
with a litte hack by fred fish and the strict ansi-c-progamming
from vbcc.

Future:
-------
Many more stringfunctions waiting. They will added, after port
and test them.

Sources:
--------
The sourcecode has no makefile, because I used my PMM to create
the lib.
If you really need them, please contact me.
