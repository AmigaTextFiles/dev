This readme is written dec 1998.
I write many year's software on the amiga for my own
use. I've make it as commercial software. But I think
the amiga community is a great thing and so, I give
my work now free away.
Because I changed the compiler from Aztec to vbcc I
missed any things. Also I rewrite many part's and
lock on a software-archiv with free software that
I build in the last years. Based on this software
and my own I build library's and port my software
easy from the old to the new compiler. But I think,
there must be more people, that have the same problem
and the lib's will be usefull for them. But it will
not help, if the lib's only include the functions
that I missed. Also I port my software and than I
complete the libs, lock around and find other good
and usefull libs that not available on vbcc.
As example, there is an old lib to check the use
of memory. 3 week's ago I had a problem that and
this lib missed. Also I will now port all this
software and put it on my web-sides for all user
that will use it.

Note:
All freeware libs from other authors comes out
with the sources. My own software comes without
the source.
A makefile not exists and so can't it be include.
I use the own Pmm-System to create all software
and it work with a own dataformat.
Lock at my web-sides for Pmm. It is a complete
projectmanager for complex c-project's.
