     I have posted the sources for "gi" to net.sources.  gi is a program
I whipped up to assist on a project I am currently working on, and which
I felt would be of general use to a lot of us Amigoids.

    gi reads a DeluxePaint "brush" file, and produces an output file which
contains the C statements necessary to create an Image structure, including
height, width, depth, and color information, as well as the array of data
which represents the bit planes of an image.  gi also allows re-assignment
of the color registers used by an image (particularly useful for sprites).

    The syntax of gi is as follows:
	 gi <DP brush filename> <output filename>
gi will read the brush file, analyze its data, and produce a list of the
color register assignments used for the image.	It then allows the re-
assignment of color registers.	When color register assignment is complete,
it produces the output file containing the C statements.

NOTES  -   The color map data is output in packed RGB format, and is
   meant as advisory information only - the output file WILL need
   to be edited before it is suitable for use.

BUGS   -   Lord knows.	Probably some, although I think it mostly works.
   It does enough to get MY job done, anyway.

IMPROVEMENTS POSSIBLE - Infinite.  Currently, gi does not allow duplicate
   color register assignments, nor does it allow for output in "Sprite"
   format.  It would be nice to "Intuitionize" gi, allowing display
   of the image, menus, gadgets, etc.,	but I'll let someone else do
   that.

   Have fun!
