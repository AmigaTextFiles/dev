         GetImage - by Michael J. Farren
  A utility to convert DPaint brushes into c source code as Image structures.

   This archive contains the source & executable for gi and GetImage
  by Michael J. Farren. Gi is the unadulterated program and GetImage is a
  version that I hacked up a bit to suit my needs. Both programs make Image
  source from a DPaint brush file, but GetImage also creates an Image
  structure along with the Image data, and includes other info about the
  processed Image. GetImage also does not require a destination filename.
  This way your Image source file has the same name as your brush file but
  with a '.c' extender.
   For those of you that have used the ImageMaker program, GetImage has
  one big advantage over it in that very large brushes can be processed
  without getting a truncated source file. ImageMaker can't handle brushes
  that are 100x20 pixels in dimension in med-res, while I have yet to have
  GetImage to gag on anything.
   These programs were compiled with the Aztec 3.20a compiler, but
  Lattice should work just fine.
   GetImage & gi run perfectly under Kickstart 1.2 beta-7(release).
   If anybody makes some useful changes to these programs I'd like to
  have access to the new code, as I use this program a lot.

More Updates, by Charles A. Brand
---------------------------------

   1/90 This utility has been since upgraded to:
            1. Search for BODY label, instead of assuming it is allways
               12 bytes passed the GRAB label.
            2. Only prints the data for the bit planes that are used in
               the Image, (Planes that are not all zero's), and sets
               the PlanePick variable in the Image structure accordingly.
            3. Prints the entire colormap and labels which colors are
               used by the Image.
            4. Adds the #include's needed, to the file, to allow you to
               compile it immediately.
            5. Show the size of the Image data array, so that you know
               how many bytes of CHIP_MEM to Allocate in your program
               to render the Image. (Note the array size is in WORDs, in
               the outputed C file.)
