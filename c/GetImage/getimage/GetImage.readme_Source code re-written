If you compare GetImage.c.orig with the re-written file GetImage.c
you should see immediately why this update was created.

I find it amazing that this program (gi) is still around & that no one
has improved upon it very much.  I made a few improvements but mostly
I re-wrote the GetImage.c source file for readability, Jim Steichen.

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   68040 or better microprocessor. (or Re-compile the program).

ORIGINAL README CONTENTS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An enhanced version of "gi" from disk 14.  It now looks for the GRAB
marker, in the brush file, instead of assuming that it is at a specific
place, sets up the PlanePick value in the Image structure, and deletes any
unused bitplanes to save memory and disk space.
