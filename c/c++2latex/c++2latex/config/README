This folder contains some stuff to support c++2latex's usage within
imke configurated application programs.

	1. `Imakefile' contains a DVI target generated by 

	2. `mkpt' a `make pretty definition target' tool based on the
	imake rules provided by 

	3. `pretty.rules', which must be included from your `local.def'
	files somewhere down your system's X11 tree
	(e.g. /usr/local/X11/config/local.def)

This is just a demo, but we use it for our InterViews based CARTOON
project...

Enjoy!
