MatchWild.c         01/09/95           Paul Stevenson

This is a function you can call to add wildcard support to your programs.
It is called like:
    MatchWild(char *pattern, char *reference);

    where the first argument is a pointer to the string you wish to test,
possibly containing wildcards. The second argument is a pointer to the
string you're really looking for. It may not contain wildcards.

tokens currently supported are:
      #, ?, *
      and any combination thereof.

Possible problems may arise by bizarre use. Things to remember:
    # means 0 or more occurences of the next single character typed.
    ? means exactly 1 character which may be anything.
    #? therefore means anything at all - including nothing
    * means exactly the same as #?

    This software is so free, they're giving it away. Feel free to use it.
Although it seems to work fine, it could do with extended support for more
exotic wildcards. Feel free to improve it (mail me a copy).

Compilation note: The routine is recursive: If very complicated wild card
strings are called the will be correctly parsed but can cause a stack
overflow unless provision is made to avoid this.
