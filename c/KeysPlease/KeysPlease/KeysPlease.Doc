** DISTRIBUTION:***********************************************************

KeysPlease is SHAREWARE and may be redistributed with the provision that
only reasonable media and distribution costs are charged.

If you like it, and use it, send $3 (that's THREE DOLLARS) to:
	Brian Koetting
	671 East 420 North
	Provo, Utah  84606

This is not a large program.  Three dollars is not a large sum of money.

** AAD:********************************************************************

Please add ALL APPLICABLE DISCLAIMERS here.

** INTRODUCTION:***********************************************************

KeysPlease is a nice little utility for programmers who every time they
need a RAWKEY code or an ASCII code, go hunting for that place where
they KNEW they wouldn't forget, where that stack of papers lies hidden
that contains all those important tables, lists, etc...

So unless you've got 'em all memorized (or use something different)
KeysPlease is for you.

KeysPlease displays a nice rendition of the Amiga keyboard and allows you
to either click on a key-gadget or press a key to find that key's rawcode.

Alternately, the program also displays a chart of all ASCII characters
which you can select either by mouse or key to find its value.

Numbers are displayed in both decimal and hexidecimal.

Moreover, the program is very self-explanitory.

There are other programs that perform these functions, though I have not
seen one to do them all, and certainly not as nice.

KeysPlease is "Enforcer" and "Mungwall" passed.

Note that there is a dead area on the Return key-gadget which clicking
has no effect. (this is the area under the ']' key.  By sending in your
$3 SHAREWARE fee, and a self-addressed stamped disk mailer and a blank
disk, you'll receive a version that fixes this problem.  (There has to
be _some_ motivation for registering)

** USAGE:******************************************************************

KeysPlease runs only under AmigaDOS 2.0 and above.

KeysPlease accepts the following command line argument:

	KeysPlease SCREEN/K:

where SCREEN is the keyword to indicate which public screen to open on.
If the public screen does not exist, KeysPlease will open on the default
public screen or Workbench.

For example, I have the following line added to my TTX_Startup.dfn file
in the KEYBOARD section:

	F2  ExecTool "run BOOT:Bin/KP SCREEN=TURBOTEXT"

There is also a SCREEN ToolType for Workbench users.

In addition to the CloseWindow gadget, RightAmiga-Q will quit the program
