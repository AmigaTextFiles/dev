	An encapsulation of Intuition for C++


	I ++ is a library and include files defining classes wich manage
	Intuition in a simplest way, and manage also event handling.

	There are three group of classes :

		- Windows

	Gadgets, Menu, and so on will be encapsuled one day...

	See documentation in doc directory for more informations.
	See header files for interface with your programs.

	Please test it the harder you can and send me bug report, I use it
	for my own needs but I did not test all methods seriously.


	This release is public domain, copy everything you want but tell me 
	what you modify, in a way of having one day a clean and unique version.
	All rights reserved to me.


	To install the release click 'Install' if you use Ccomeau and SAS,
