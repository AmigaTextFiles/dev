	Intuition++ documentation.

	Files .txt are ASCII and files .ps are PostScript and can be printed
	as is. Those files have been made with QXPress on MacIntosh (I apologize)
	so they cannot be interpreted by Post, but GhostScript manage them well.

	Sorry, but QXPress is the best Desktop Publishing program on the world,
	like Amiga is the best machine.
