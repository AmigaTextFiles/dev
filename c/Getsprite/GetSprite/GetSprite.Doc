This is a little utility I put together to convert DPaint brushes to C data,
which I needed for another project. It works in the same way as brush-to-
image converters: give it the filename of a DPaint brush and out comes the
same file (with .c on the end) containing the brush's palette and data,
organised in sprite format. Note that the sprite data "frame" words are
included.

If the brush is too wide (16 max) or deep (2 planes max) an error message
is given.
