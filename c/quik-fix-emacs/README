		 Using Aztec C QuikFix with GNU Emacs
	  ==================================================
Contents:
	README			- this file.

	quik-fix.el		- GNU Emacs code.

	quik-fix.rexx		- AREXX script to communicate with
				  GNU Emacs.

	quik-fix-stop.rexx	- AREXX script to abort QuikFix from
				  outside of GNU Emacs.

	menu_example		- example menu to use with QuikFix

Requirements:
	o  GNU Emacs 18.58, Amiga port 1.25DG
	   Thanks to David Gay (dgay@di.epfl.ch) for a great port!

	o  runback - the quik-fix.rexx script starts emacs with the
	   runback command (that is, if emacs is not already running).
	   If necessary, you can edit the script to use something else.

Installing:
	1. Place quik-fix.el in the GNUEmacs:lisp directory.

	2. Place the ARexx scripts in the GNUEmacs: directory.
	   (actually, it can go anywhere, but this is what I assume
	   for the following instructions)

	3. Edit the "Config" section of each quik-fix file.

	4. Create the CCEDIT environment variable.  Use the Aztec
	   "mset" command.  For example:
		mset "CCEDIT=SYS:RexxC/rx GNUEmacs:quik-fix.rexx"

	5. Put the following line in your "s:.emacs" file:
		(load "quik-fix")

	   or, you can use the following line instead:
		(autoload 'quik-fix-start "quik-fix" nil t)

	   This makes emacs load the quick-fix code only when needed
	   (thus speeding up your startup when not using quick-fix)

	6. Use the "-qf" flag when you compile.	 The compiler
	   automatically executes the CCEDIT command if there is an
	   error or a warning.

Using:
	0. The compiler starts QuikFix automatically.  If emacs
	   is not already running, the quik-fix.rexx script starts
	   it.	After emacs is running, the script executes the
	   (quik-fix-start) command.

	1. Call the following commands to move from error to error:
		quik-fix-next		- goto next error
		quik-fix-previous	- goto previous error
		quik-fix-current	- goto current error
		quik-fix-first		- goto first error
		quik-fix-last		- goto last error

	2. Call one of the following commands when you are done:
		quik-fix-stop		- cancel the compile
		quik-fix-recompile	- recompile the file

	   These commands ask you to save your files, but do not
	   exit from emacs.

	3. If, for some reason, you cannot stop QuikFix from within
	   emacs, execute the quik-fix-stop.rexx ARexx script.


Notes:
	Format of the file "AztecC.Err" (as far as I can tell):

	   str>int:int:char:int:str:
	    |	|   |	|  |  |
	    |	|   |	|  |  --- description
	    |	|   |	|  |
	    |	|   |	|  --- error code number
	    |	|   |	|
	    |	|   |	--- [EW] error or warning
	    |	|   |
	    |	|   --- column
	    |	|
	    |	--- line
	    |
	    --- filename


Bugs:
	o (quik-fix-start) displays the error message, but then emacs
	  erases it. As a workaround, select the (quik-fix-current)
	  command to redisplay the error message.

Todo:
	o If the EMACS1 ARexx port is not open, check for EMACS2, etc.

	o Figure out how to load more than 25 errors (if possible)

	o Add an optional argument to the movement commands. If you
	  call the command with an argument, move to an error. If you
	  call the command without an argument move to an error or a
	  warning.  Send me your opinions, or modify the code
	  yourself.
