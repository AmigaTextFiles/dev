This is a shar archive.  If you can't unpack it, let me know and I'll
send you the files individually.

Note: after you unpack, rename "quik-fix-stop." to "quik-fix-stop.rexx".
My Unix system has a 14 char filename limit :-(

I'll submit this to Fred Fish when I get the chance.

Send email if you have any comments,
