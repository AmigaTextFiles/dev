The programs in bin are compiled without CPU/FPU-option
and work on every amiga from 68000 to 68060.

I think, your CPU is another...

You will find 6 sub-dirs, every dir is named like a cpu.
Move or copy the binaries from the dir that matches your
cpu-typ to the bin-dir.

Check programversion and cpu-support: run "programname ?"
will show info's about the program, supported/requested
cpu and internal info's.

the program usage can show with "programname -? or -h".
The programs that MUST be startet with any option display
te help also if wrong or no options given.


PowerUP:
--------
There are a lot of problems that will make a PowerUP-
version not usefull. It begin by the start of such
programs and ends by pipelining (not work). Use the
mc68k-version!


WarpUP:
-------
My system block WarpUP (all versions over V7 that
disable ppc.library). My ppc.library start bevor
startup (i think it starts from the flashrom).
WarpUP has no chance or permissions to change the
ppc-controlling.
So I can not test the warpup-programs. To change
this problem I will change the A1200 bevor the
year ends to a better machine. If you use Warp
V14, please send me a status, with problem (if
exists) you find. To really work, better use the
mc68k-versions.   SORRY about that
