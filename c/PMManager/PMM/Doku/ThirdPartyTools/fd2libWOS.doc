fd2libWOS by Frank Wille / Volker Barthelmann / Johnny Tevessen


INTRODUCTION

    fd2libWOS takes .fd-files as input and generates assembler source to
    create a library with stubs to call the functions (including stubs
    for varargs functions).


LEGAL

    fd2libWOS is public domain.


USAGE

    Usage : fd2libWOS [-sd] [-l] [-r2] [-nv] [-base <name>] [-o <dir>]
                      [-of <format>] [-d] [-?|--help] [files/pattern]

      -sd  : Use small data model (else large data model)
             Not yet supported.
      -l   : First argument (r3) is library base
      -r2  : PPC-only library uses r2 as base register (##abi PPC2)
      -nv  : No varargs logic - ...A and ...TagList will not be detected
      -base: Overwrites library base name (##base)
      -o   : Specify directory to store source files in
      -of  : C printf style output format to generate compiling
             script. Three `%s' are replaced with output file name
      -d   : Turn on debugging/verbose mode
      -?   : Show help/version and quit
    files  : FD files to convert, defaults to stdin

    Commandline is parsed left-to-right. So specifying

    > fd2libwos alib_lib.fd -sd blib_lib.fd

    will result in alib created using large data model.

    There may also be a -prof option in future, but it's not yet
    implemented.

    fd2libwos will process all the .fd-files specified at the command line
    (not specifying any filename results in fd2libwos using stdin (console)
    as input) and will generate an assembler source for each library
    function as functionname.s and a file containing all the library
    vector offsets as libname_lvo.s.

    Files are placed in the current directory. Specify an alternative
    destination using the `-o <dir>' option.


GENERATED CODE

    fd2libWOS creates code to be assembled with Frank Wille's pasm (use
    option -F2 for EHF). The generated stubs are compatible with H&P's
    PowerOpen-ABI. vlink is recommended for linking the stubs, because
    the "@_xxx" symbols have to be created on demand.


VARARGS

    Some functions take a pointer to a list of arguments as the last
    argument. fd2libwos has a hardcoded list of such function and creates
    additional stubs that can be called with a variable number of arguments
    from C (e.g. OpenWindowTagList and OpenWindowTags).

    If you want to extend this list, you have to add the name of the
    function and the name of the varargs function to the file vargs.h
    and recompile fd2libwos.

    Fd2libwos also tries to recognize functions that might have varargs
    automatically. It scans for `TagList' and `A' postfixes and sub-
    stitutes them with `Tags' or `'. `A's are only suggested to be varargs
    if the letter right before is lowercase.

    You may turn off automatic recognition by specifying `-nv'.


GOODIES

    `-of <string>' allows you to get runtime output. You may use this
    feature to show fd2libwos's progress or to create batch files for post-
    processing fd2libwos's output. `%s' is substituted by the output asm file
    just processed. E.g.:

    > fd2libWOS -of "pasm -F2 %s" fd:dos_lib.fd >batchfile
    > execute batchfile

    will process dos' functions and then compile them straight-forward.

    You may use `%s' upto three times in the format string. C like jokes
    like `%30s' to show the file's name right-aligned are also allowed.


CREATING LIBRARIES

    If you want to create a library from some .fd-files proceed like this:

    > delete T:#?.(s|o) quiet
    > fd2libWOS -o T: <all the .fd-files you want>

    (copying pasm to ram: now may speed up the process)

    > vc +warpos -c T:#?.s
    > join as <name of resulting lib> T:#?.o
    > delete T:#?.(s|o)


MakeALIB.script

    This is a small but smart script which will create an amiga.lib
    in T:. It will delete files from T: before and assumes nothing is
    written to T: while it is running.

    You have to assign FD: to a directory that contains the .fd-files for
    the Amiga shared libraries and cd into the libsrc/AmigaLib directory
    and start it from there. Otherwise you will get an error.

    It will then create all library stubs and LVOs with fd2libWOS (this
    will result in many many small files in T: which will be assembled by
    pasm - so having pasm in RAM: will speed it up quite a lot).

    Then the support routines in libsrc/AmigaLib will be compiled/assembled
    and the resulting object files will be put in T:, too. You must have
    the C= includes.

    The support routines are taken from libnix and have been changed a bit
    to work with vbcc. I have not tested them and several support routines
    from the original amiga.lib are missing.

    The whole process may take quite some time and a few MB space in T:
    The resulting amiga.lib should be free from any copyright and is a
    rather good (but not complete) replacement for the original amiga.lib.

    If everything went right you will be asked whether you want to have the
    library installed to vlibwos:. Type <y> or do so manually if you don't
    trust my script. :-)
