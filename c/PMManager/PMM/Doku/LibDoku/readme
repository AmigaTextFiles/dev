 Supra -- Additional functions to the existing Amiga libraries
 =====

 Version 1.1 (11. Apr 1995)
 © Copyright by Jure Vrhovnik. All rights reserved.

You can use Supra library in your own programs. You can redistribute
the original archive as long as it remains unchanged. You may change
the source code but you have to report all changes to the author of
Supra library.



1) INTRODUCTION
------------------

    Supra is a collection of routines that can be considered as a
small update to Amiga ROM libraries.
Since computer programs grow complexier day by day programmers find
it hard to cope with high level organization, and thus can't afford to
use their time for implementing basic routines. That's why Amiga's
libraries are so valuable - they help programmers to concentrate on
developing larger projects and make the pieces of a puzzle bigger.
However, Amiga libraries haven't been updated for quite a long time.
The pieces of a puzzle haven't changed, but the puzzle grows along with
more advanced projects.

This is my first release of supra functions. The collection is very
tiny. However I hope this release will set a decent example that
Amiga OS can and should be updated.



2) DESCRIPTION
-----------------

    Supra is a linked library which contains a few useful functions
that are easy to use. A brief description of what it contains:

    o File copier
    o Very easy but powerful recursive directory scanning
    o Quick file type/existance checking
    o Create an entire directory path (extension to CreateDir() )
    o Image colour remapping (now you can show images in their real
      colors on a workbench!)
    o Obtain a list of best pens (extension to ObtainBestPen()


Here is a list of function names:

    - FCopy()
    - FileType()
    - RecDirInit()
    - RecDirNext()
    - RecDirTags()
    - RecDirFree()
    - MakePath()
    - ObtPens()
    - RelPens()
    - MakeNewImg()
    - FreeNewImg()
NEW - AddToolType()


Every function is well documented and there are some useful examples
included in this archive.



3) INSTALLATION
-----------------

    This release has only a header file for C language. You should
do the following:

- copy lib/supra.lib library into your lib: directory
- copy libraries/supra.h header file to include:libraries/supra.h



4) USAGE
-----------

    When you want to use any function from supra library with your
C program you have to include a header file supra.h in your source:

#include <libraries/supra.h>

You'll have to link your object file with lib:supra.lib



5) AUTHOR
------------

    I want Supra library to be as perfect as any rom libraries. I
will be very happy for any comments about it (concerning source code,
documentation, new ideas etc.). Programmers who have experiences in
other languages, please contact me if you are willing to make header
files in order to get supra available to other languages as well.

6) HISTORY
-------------

    o v1.1  - Minor problem in source code: no pragmas were included
              (only clib instead of proto). That was causing some problems
              with linking. This is now repaired.
            - AddToolType() function

    o v1.0  First release
