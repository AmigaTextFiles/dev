 @{b}What is it?@{ub}


    Supra is a collection of routines that can be considered as a small
update to Amiga ROM libraries. Since computer programs grow complexier
day by day programmers find it hard to cope with high level
organization, and thus can't afford to use their time for implementing
basic routines. That's why Amiga's libraries are so valuable - they help
programmers to concentrate on developing larger projects and make the
pieces of a puzzle bigger. However, Amiga libraries haven't been updated
for quite a long time. The pieces of a puzzle haven't changed, but the
puzzle grows along with more advanced projects.

This is my first release of supra functions. The collection is very
tiny. However I hope this release will set a decent example that Amiga
OS can and should be updated.

@{b}What do you get?@{ub}


    Supra is a linked library which contains a few useful functions that
are easy to use. A brief description of what it contains:

    o File copier
    o Very easy but powerful recursive directory scanning
    o Quick file type/existance checking
    o Create an entire directory path (extension to CreateDir() )
    o Image colour remapping (now you can show images in their real
      colors on a workbench!)
    o Obtain a list of best pens (extension to ObtainBestPen() ) NEW o
Add or alter icon's tooltypes


Here is a list of function names:

    - FCopy()
    - FileType()
    - RecDirInit()
    - RecDirNext()
    - RecDirTags()
    - RecDirFree()
    - MakePath()
    - ObtPens()
    - RelPens()
    - MakeNewImg()
    - FreeNewImg() NEW - AddToolType() 

Every function is well documented and there are some useful examples
included in this archive.

@{b}How to install?@{ub}


    This release has only a header file for C language. You should do
the following:

    - copy lib/supra.lib library into your lib: directory
    - copy libraries/supra.h header file to include:libraries/supra.h

@{b}How to use it?@{ub}


    When you want to use any function from supra library with your C
program you have to include a header file supra.h in your source:

#include <libraries/supra.h>

You'll have to link your object file with lib:supra.lib

    I want Supra library to be as perfect as any rom libraries. I will
be very happy for any comments about it (concerning source code,
documentation, new ideas etc.). Programmers who have experiences in
other languages, please contact me if you are willing to make header
files in order to get supra available to other languages as well.

    @{b}o v1.1@{ub}  - Minor problem in source code: no pragmas were included
              (only clib instead of proto). That was causing some problems
              with linking. This is now repaired.
            - AddToolType() function
