; if not startet from pmm-root-dir, absolut path must included

Assign PMM: ""

If not exists
  MakeDir PMM:Err
  MakeDir PMM:Developer/Lib
EndIf

The next two assign's used by me for own includes and the
sourcedir's. I think that I don't include anything that use
this assigns. If I make an error and the called from everywhere
you knwo the meaning of them now.

; Assign include: vinclude:
; Assign proj: <my mainpath>

; Add the dis with binaries and scripts to search-path

Path PMM: PMM:Bin PMM:Batch ADD


; Add the FD-Files (better copy them and forget this)

Assign FD: PMM:Developer/FD ADD
Assign Lib: PMM:Developer/Lib

; The next lines may be not useable for everybody. I include
; them only as demo what to do if Pmm is the only used tool
; on the system. I use them since the last makefile is deleted
; Remember: unalias unset any alias
;
; The commandreplace with alias is the best way to change them
; wihout really changes on the system. PmmLibr emulate both
; commands without problems. But "make <prog> ALL" don't work,
; that must write in Pmm-syntax as make <prog> -o all. The alias
; is because because I forget often to write the "new" command
;
; Make <name>      now uses Pmm
; Alib and Libr    now replaced with PmmLibr

Alias   Make    "Pmm -o 40 -q 88 -p "
Alias   Alib    PmmLibr
Alias   Libr    PmmLibr

; if not set at other position these lines for PIPE

; Set _mchar ","
; Set _pchar "|"
