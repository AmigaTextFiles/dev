Welcome to the demo version  of StormC 2.0
==========================================

Here it is: NEW version 2.0 of StormC - The programming system for the future of the AMIGA. There are a lot of enhancements and improvements.
Most of them were big wishes of our customers and users of the demo 
version 1.0. For that reason we want to thank everyone who supported 
the development of StormC.

I. Ratings of the Press
=======================

StormC 1.1 now got rating 

"VERY GOOD" 

in the biggest magazine, called AMIGA MAGAZIN (Publisher: Magna Media).

Some impressions of articles of the German press regarding the Preview 
version 0.9: (I will try to translate it as close to the original as 
possible)

Amiga Plus 1 / 96

  New concepts of development and quality assurance... 
  The first remarkable feature is the project management...

Amiga magazine 1 / 96

  The project management: At last there is a tool that does not feel 
  like a "ball and chain", but is really useful.

Amiga Special 2 / 96

  A fast compiler, a powerful debugger and a comfortable
  development system are an interesting mixture, if we talk about
  professional software engineering..


With the enclosed demo you can convince yourself of these statements.


II. Features of StormC 2.0
==========================

StormC 2.0 [NEW]
The Advanced C/C++ Development System for the Future of the AMIGA !

StormC is an integrated development system which contains all 
development tools imperative for efficient engineering: editor, 
compiler, linker, debugger and RunShell with many outstanding 
features.

The heart of StormC is its visual project manager which manages every 
part of the project, e.g. sources, headers, libraries, documents, 
binaries.

The very fast editor displays key-words colourfully to get a better
readability and a syntax check.

The StormC compiler handles ANSI C and C++ sources and generates 
optimised code for the whole Motorola 68xxx family (including 68060 
and 68881/882).

The RunShell is a powerful run-time system that monitors the running
application and prevents it from crashing the system. It also offers
resource tracking and it can start the source-level debugger 
during (!) run-time of the program.

([NEW]Features marked by this are new in version 2.0.)

III. Restraints of the demo
===========================

The enclosed compiler will compile your large sources but he will however 
write a maximum of 10 KB of object code. But you can get the assurance 
that your large projects can be compiled too.

The linker can write programs with a maximum of 20 KB of 
size.

All parts of StormC can NOT be started from CLI. They can be used only 
with the integrated environment.

The Storm demo ends automaticaly after 10 minutes.

Important
=========

This demo is optimised for installation from CD-ROM. If you have copied 
the files to your hard disk already you need not to do the installation. 
You should then enter solely an assign to StormC into the "user-startup",
so the demo programs and the pre-sets of StormC can be used unchanged.


IV. Include Licences
====================

If you have got the demo from a mailbox or from the Aminet, only our 
includes and libraries are included. For programming you will soon 
need the complete system includes of Kickstart/Workbench 3.1.

How to get these includes?
--------------------------

1. We can send you a demo of StormC with all includes, but you have 
   to pay a charge of 20 $ (30 DM). You have to pay in advance.

2. You will find the complete includes and libraries on the CD 1/96
   of the German "Amiga Magazin".

3. If you have got our Preview of StormC you have already got these 
   files too.

You only have to add the following files:

In the includes drawer the directories:

  datatypes
  devices
  diskfont
  dos
  exec
  gadgets
  graphics
  hardware
  intuition
  libraries
  prefs
  resources
  rexx
  utility
  workbench

In the libs drawer the libraries:

  amiga.lib
  small.lib
  debug.lib
  ddebug.lib

Please do not use the includes of other compilers or directly these 
of other compilers or our Preview. We have altered some of them, 
so they will only work the way we told you.


V. MagicMenu and SUN-Mouse-Utilities
====================================

If you use MagicMenu the mouse pointer freezes up to 10 seconds if you 
are pressing the right mouse button over an icon of the icon bar. This 
is because MagicMenu is not very OS compliant.

The same problem can appear with other SUN mouse utilities too.
