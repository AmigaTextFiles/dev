 SYNOPSIS
 diff [-abhitw] [ -c[#] | -e | -f | -n ] options fileA fileB

 DESCRIPTION
 diff is used to compare the contents of two text files. Diff3
 compares three files.  Lines that are the same in all files are not
 printed.  Lines that are different are shown with arrows.  Note that
 the arrow "points" at the file from which the line came:

 < Lines found in fileA, but not in fileB.
 > Lines found in fileB, but not in fileA.

 -a  Treat the files as normal (ascii) text files. It may be
     necessary when the files include characters outside the 0-127
     range (ie 7-bit).

 -b  Treat the files as binary files. In this case it will only say
     whether fileA and fileB are the same, but dosn't give any
     detail on where they differ.

 -h  Perform a fast search. It can get confused when changes are not
     well separated but does work on files of unlimited length.

 -i  Ignore the case of letters.

 -t  Expand TAB characters in output lines. Normal or -c output adds
     character(s) to the front of each line which may alter the
     indentation of the original source lines and make the output
     listing difficult to interpret. This option will preserve the
     original source's indentation.

 -w  Ignore all blanks (SPACE and TAB characters); for example,
     `if ( a == b )' will compare equal to `if(a==b)'.


       The following options are mutually-exclusive:


 -c[#]  Use an alternate style of output: output begins with
        identification of the files involved and their creation dates,
        then each change is separated by a line with a dozen *s. The
        lines removed from filename1 are marked with `- '; those added
        to filename2 are marked `+'. Lines which are changed from one
        file to the other are marked in both files with `!'. Every line
        is shown with along with the preceding # lines and the
        following # lines. If omitted, # defaults to 3.

 -e  Produce a script of a, c, and d commands for the editor ed,
     which will recreate filename2 from filename1.

 -f  Produce a script similar to that of -e, not useful with ed,
     which is in the opposite order (also the commands are in the
     form 'letter''line' instead of 'line''letter').

 -n  Produce a script similar to that of -e and -f but suitable for RCS.
