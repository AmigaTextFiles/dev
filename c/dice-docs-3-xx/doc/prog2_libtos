 This program converts the Commodore supplied amiga.lib from large data
 model to small data model.  You must convert amiga.lib before you can
 use it with the DICE system to generate residentable programs.

 Note that this isn't required, but a small-data amiga.lib will generate
 faster code with fewer reloc32's (and thus load much faster).

 The small-data-model version of amiga.lib is called AMIGAS.LIB
