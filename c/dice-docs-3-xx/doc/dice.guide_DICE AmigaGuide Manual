- This guide was written with v39/40 amigaguide lib and datatype in mind,
it will probably work with v37, but I have no way of testing it, any
reports of problems, (although I have tried to be careful) would be
helpful thanks.

- Its all messy! The text does not even fit into the window properly? err
this is your fault, it does on my computer. I used polarsmall.font, I cant
possibly get it to fit with all font sizes on all screen resolutions (the
RTF version is for this). Anyway, why are you using a screen font that does
not allow you to fit a standard width 75 columns line onto your screen at 
once? wordwrap is set to 76. This seemed the best option. If you have small
problems change this, if you have big problems use the RTF version...!!

Introduction to @{b}DICE 3.16@{ub}

- 1) DICE is back in development by @{b}Richard Drummond@{ub}, of CU Amiga
     Fame (well almost) as well as anybody else who wants to contribute.
     It was only posted on 02/10/98 so don't expect a IDE yet.
     Mail him at....
     
     @{B}dice@drummond.u-net.com@{UB} and the DICE mailing list at
     @{B}onelist.com/archives.cgi/dice@{UB} free subscription .....!!
     
- 2) Yes it was compiled from the Free DICE 3.15 source, (yes I tried it
     as well, takes ages however) get if from aminet, dev/c/dice-3.15.lha
     and spend hours fiddling to try and get it to work.
     
- 3) Matt Dillion @{b}Fully@{ub} supports new DICE versions and is in the 
     process off setting up a CVS deposit for any new source code. (cool)

- 4) Yes, those are the fd files and No, its OK, they were (apparently)
     released just before they lost it last time.

- 5) What's this AmigaGuide? err, its going to be part of the new
     documentation set. I also plan a RTF version (this will come before
     any major new amigaguide versions). I will test it on ww6, Word6/97
     (PC/MAC), (sorry but lets face it - where are people going to print all
     this stuff out? yep at college, university or at work, so unless you
     are very lucky is go to work with Word) also it is much easier to use
     as a reference in paper form, well I think so...., some more help is
     needed however..

- 6) Who the hell are you!!, err sorry Matthew Fletcher, mjf or mfletche on
     chat areas. I am doing software engineering but prefer to play around
     all day with masses of text files. Mail me at...
     
     @{B}Matthew.Fletcher@student.shu.ac.uk@{UB} or over the summer 
     @{B}amimjf@Hotmail.com@{UB} just don't expect quick replies.....!!

@NODE history "Where has this guide been? (MCP.Guide homage, kind of thing)"
@prev newstuff
@next main

- @{i}18/10/1998@{ui}
When this guide was begun. At the moment, it is just a quick tester. only an
Amigaguide front end to the mass of out of date and messy text documents
that reside in the docs drawer. This was 0.1 (I wonder what would happen if
you were to check the version from the shell ???) and was mailed of to
Richard for abuse and maybe some comments.

- @{i}22/10/1998@{ui}
In hindsight, the layout for the the previous version was a bit crap, anyway
it was totally re-done and with much pain and effort was re-designed and
made in a more professional manner, (i.e. it has working prev / next and an
index buttons) now. It is at times like this that I wish that the "search"
code that exists within v40 datatype library worked, as the index is going
to be massive and will take an age to load / scroll on anything other than a
060. I also noticed a nasty problem, the backslash does not appear in my
guides. I have tried lots of fonts but I think it could be an Amigaguide
problem?

- @{i}08/01/1999@{ui}
The guide has just about been converted now all that needs doing is to
update the contents (shock horror) for any new releases.. Also i have
had a few people point out rarther embrasing errors on my part but its
all for a good cause.

- @{i}12/05/1999@{ui}
Still fiddling, infact it could be considered a major re-design of the
whole interface, but anyway,.. cut out loads of duplication.

- @{i}13/07/1999@{ui}
Uploaded to AmiNet, and got some feedback from Matteo Cortese, using his
version of the guide (thanks), i updated whole chunks of stuff.

This was one of the areas that we thought should be beefed up, due to the
lack of real programming tutorials, books etc. The beginners will have real
problems, so these are what we came up with. Yes I know there are two simple
tutorials in the introduction section but this is the main section for all
that kind of stuff and it also contains the sources so that you don't have
to type them all in.
