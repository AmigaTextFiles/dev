@{b}Project Manager Beta@{ub}

OK so this may be a new consept for hardcore shell users but everyone else
prefers a frontend for their compilers. It allows easy organisation of source
files, libs and paths as well as providing an easy way of using Dice options.
Eventually PM will provide support for all of DICE functions, and all those
of the DICE suite of programs to. However this is not going to be an IDE, or
Intigirated Development Enviroment of the sorts that StormC or PC users have.

However it will...

- Automaticly Generate and Update Dmakefiles.
- Provide GUI control of all the DICE suite of tools.
- Provide for Error correction and intrigration with text editors
- ??
