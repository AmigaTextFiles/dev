 NAME
 _DOSBase auto-open

 SYNOPSIS

 FUNCTION
 If the _DOSBase base variable is referenced (i.e. extern) but not
 declared then _DOSBase will be automatically declared in the doslib
 module of auto.lib.  Additionally, auto.lib adds routines to the
 autoinit and autoexit sequences called by c.a that automatically
 opens "dos.library" before _main and closes it after _exit.

 If the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is
 ever called.

 The autoexit routine that closes the library first checks to see if
 the base variable is NULL and skips trying to close the library if
 so.

 NOTE
 _DOSBase is normally openned this way for most programs since parts
 of c.a are normally reference that make dos calls.  In fact, all
 programs that use the main() entry point since c.lib's _main()
 entry point references DOS.

 NAME
 _GFXBase auto-open

 SYNOPSIS

 FUNCTION
 If the _GFXBase base variable is referenced (i.e. extern) but not
 declared then _GFXBase will be automatically declared in the gfxlib
 module of auto.lib.  Additionally, auto.lib adds routines to the
 autoinit and autoexit sequences called by c.a that automatically
 opens "graphics.library" before _main and closes it after _exit.

 If the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is
 ever called.

 The autoexit routine that closes the library first checks to see if
 the base variable is NULL and skips trying to close the library if
 so.

 NOTE
 Programs that use this auto-open feature by simply calling graphics
 library functions without bothering to declare or open the library
 will only compile under DICE.  When compiled with other compilers a
 link error will occur since the linker will not be able to find any
 declared storage for the base variable, only references.

 EXAMPLE
 /*
  *  Example program which just calls a graphics.library function
  *  without bothering to open the library.
  */

 main()
 {
     WaitTOF();

 NAME
 _MathIeeeDoubBasBase auto-open

 SYNOPSIS

 FUNCTION
 If the _MathIeeeDoubBasBase base variable is referenced (i.e.
 extern) but not declared then _MathIeeeDoubBasBase will be
 automatically declared in the ieeelib module of auto.lib.
 Additionally, auto.lib adds routines to the autoinit and autoexit
 sequences called by c.a that automatically opens
 "mathieeedoubbas.library" before _main and closes it after _exit.

 If the auto-open fails the program will be aborted before _main is
 ever called.

 The autoexit routine that closes the library first checks to see if
 the base variable is NULL and skips trying to close the library if
 so.

 NOTE
 DICE uses the autoinit feature to automatically open and close
 floating point libraries that are indirectly referenced by
 fp operations.

 EXAMPLE
 #include <stdlib.h>

 main()
 {
     double d;

     d = atof("1.234");
 }

 SYNOPSIS

 FUNCTION

 Additionally, auto.lib adds routines to the autoinit and autoexit

 to the autoinit and autoexit sequences called by c.a that
