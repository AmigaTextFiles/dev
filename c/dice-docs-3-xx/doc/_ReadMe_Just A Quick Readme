                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes this is just a quick readme to explain some things which I might not
have mentioned too often in the docs, so here goes...

1.  Yes, the text files have gone (they are still on Aminet though)!

2.  Yes, there is now an AmigaGuide version and Yes, it was a big effort
    and Yes, there are probably loads of errors. Please tell me..

    - Matthew.Fletcher@student.shu.ac.uk or
    - amimjf@Hotmail.com (in the summer months)

3.  Yes, there is a RTF (Rich Text Format) version and it will load into
    Wordworth or Final Writer. If it does not, then contact me... or it
    probably never will.

    ************ Important ***********
    This is very large so unless you have loads of ink and all night to
    print the thing off at home, DON'T do it at college or work, or it
    will cost an absolute bomb and require about 50MB of mem to print...
    ************ Important ***********

4.  What? No ANSI / FXTX / HTML / or other custom format versions? err
    sorry but we are talking a 3mb+ (DICE) download already and what
    would be the point? We should all buy Amiga books... right?

5.  This is just a geneal note, so save everybody a bit of hastle, please
    use the provided installer, and if possible version 43.3 (the latest)
    as well as getting setpatch 43.6, thanks.
