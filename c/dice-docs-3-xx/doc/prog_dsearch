 SYNOPSIS
 dsearch "string" [files/wildcards]
 qsearch "string" [files/wildcards]

 DESCRIPTION
 The DSEARCH program will do a case-insensitive search for the
 specified string in the specified files.  Wildcarded file names
 may be specified.  DSEARCH prints out the name of each file
 scanned whether or not any matches are found in that file.

 QSEARCH works like DSEARCH but only prints out the name of files
 when matches are found within them.

 Both DSEARCH and QSEARCH are the *SAME* executable. One can nominally
 COPY DSearch QSearch to obtain a 'qsearch'.
