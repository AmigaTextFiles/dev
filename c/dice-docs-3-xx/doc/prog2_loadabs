 GENERATING ROMABLE FIRMWARE // LOADING AN EXECUTABLE ABSOLUTE

 LoadAbs exefile -o outfile  -A addr

 exefile     - executable to do the absolute relocation on
 outfile     - resulting image file
 addr        - 0xHEX absolute relocation address

 LoadAbs takes a standard Amiga executable and generates an image file
 relocated to the absolute location specified.  The image file is layed
 out in the same order as the hunks appear in the amiga executable.  BSS
 hunks will generate 0's in the image file.

 This program will do 32 bit relocations only.  Generally you only use
 LoadAbs with -mD -mC compiled programs.
