The location of top level includes such as stdio.h

@{i}DINCLUDE:Amiga13/@{ui}
The proper location of 1.3 amiga includes, -1.3 option must be used with DCC 
or set in ENV:DCCOPTS or you will get trash when you try to compile. It is
probably also worth saying that you can have the includes anywhere, as long
as you make the assign properly.

@{i}DINCLUDE:Amiga20/@{ui}
The location of 2.0 amiga includes, -2.0 option must be used with DCC or set 
in ENV:DCCOPTS.

@{i}DINCLUDE:Amiga30/@{ui}
I wonder what these could be ?, humm ?, it is worth noteing that if you like
me have never even seen a 1.3 include then dont worry, i just have all the
3.0 inludes dumped straght into DINCLUDE: and it al works just fine.

NOTE !!! Amiga 1.3 and 2.0 includes should be placed in the subdirectory 
dinclude:Amiga13 and dinclude:amiga20, that is, dinclude:Amiga13/Exec/*.h, 
dinclude:Amiga13/graphics/*.h, etc...

@{b}DCC generated link lines@{ub}

If you give DICE the following line (if DCCOPTS contains the -1.3 option):

    1> DCC foo.o -o foo

It will run DLink with the following options:

DLink dlib:c.o foo.o dlib:cs.lib dlib:amigas13.lib dlib:auto.lib dlib:x.o -o foo

    DLIB:C.O            DICE startup code
    FOO.O               your object module(s)
    DLIB:CS.LIB         small data model version of c.lib
    DLIB:AMIGAS13.LIB   small data model version of commodore amiga.lib for 1.3
    DLIB:AUTO.LIB       DICE AUTO.LIB
    DLIB:X.O            DICE section terminator code

Some explanation is in order. AUTO.LIB catches any references to common
library base variables when no storage has been declared and imports code 
to automatically open said libraries on startup and close them on exit.  
DICE uses this feature to import code to open and close "dos.library" when 
DOSBase is referenced, and also for the floating point libraries.

You, the programmer, can use the feature to simply make arbitrary library 
calls and not have to deal with base variables, openning, or closing 
libraries in your code.  To take advantage of the feature simply do not 
declare library base variables or open/close the libraries.

X.O is used to supply an RTS at the end of the special autoinit and autoexit 
sections.  Any module between C.O and X.O may declare these special sections 
to handle run-time relocations and other DICE features, and do so such that
when the base of the section is JSR'd all the various module's code is 
sequenced through until the RTS in X.O is hit for the sections in question.

@{b}SMALL DATA AMIGA.LIB@{ub}

DICE uses a small-data model version of Commodore's AMIGA.LIB to allow it 
to generate residentable executables (-r option to DCC). The small data
amiga.lib, called AMIGAS13.LIB (note the 's') is generated from the large 
modem amiga.lib with the LIBTOS program. (under 2.0 it's AMIGAS20.LIB)

The source to the LIBTOS program is available to allow developers using 
DICE to add new base variables to LIBTOS's search list when new operating 
systems come out without having to wait for my update.

WARNING!!  Commodore screwed up the var-args entry points in the 2.0 
amiga.lib, such as CreateNewProcTags().  To ensure that you get tags that 
work properly, you must remake the 2.0 's' library from the library source
archive after installing updates from commodore. The DICE library source 
overides these var-args tags with ones that work.

@{b}COMPILER FEATURES LIST@{ub}

- ANSI.  Pretty much ansi.  Please report non-ansism problems. Check out the 
KnownBugs section and release notes before reporting a problem.

- autos are placed in registers based on weighted usage.  A0,A1,D0,D1 will 
be used as register variables whenever possible, which usually reduces the 
number of registers that must be saved/restored in critical low level 
routines.  The 'register' keyword is essentially ignored but does add some 
weight to the variable for register selection. If you do not wish a variable
to be placed in a register, use the volatile storage qualifier when 
declaring the variable.

- LINK/UNLK is removed from low level routines that do not reference A5 and
do not make any subroutine calls.

- MOVEM is converted to MOVE or deleted entirely when possible.

- Various obvious optimizations:  use of BSET, BCLR, BTST as short cuts to 
logic operations, CMP/TST, etc...

- Switch() statements are optimized as follows:

 * if the range of values is less than double the number of cases a lookup
 table will be used

 * if a small number of cases exists a sub[q]/beq sequence will be used

 * for a sufficiently large set of cases that cannot be made into a jump 
 table, a binary subdivision method is used allowing huge switches to be 
 processed very quickly.

- Branch optimization.  Bxx to BRAs are optimized (up to 20 hops) by DAS, 
and massive optimization is done to multi-level conditionals by the main 
compiler pass.  branches to the next instruction are deleted entirely.

- Workbench support.  The standard startup module supports the workbench.
Specifically, the low level _main() in c.o does this. When a program is run
from the workbench, a different entry point is called: wbmain(wbmsg)

If you do not supply a wbmain() then the one from the c.lib library is used
which immediately return(-1)s, exiting the program.

The standard return from wbmain() or using exit() or _exit() automatically 
ReplyMsg()s the workbench message for you, do NOT do so manually.

- _main() shortcut for extremely low level programs.

    REFER TO THE _MAIN SECTION FOR INFORMATION ON USING THE _main()
    ENTRY POINT INSTEAD OF main().

- AutoInit support.  You may qualify a subroutine with the __autoinit 
keyword that will cause it to be automatically called by the startup code 
rather than having to explicitly call it from main.

This feature is more useful to bring code in indirectly.  For example, to 
automatically OpenLibrary() (& CloseLibrary()) floating point libraries if 
their base variables are referenced.  However, it can also be used for 
independant module initialization.  Note that stdio is NOT up and running 
at this time.

Refer to the auto.lib source code for examples.

__autoexit works the same way.  Note that __autoinit routines are called 
BEFORE _main, just after autoinit libraries are openned, and __autoexit 
routines are called in __exit just before autoinit libraries are closed.

- DCC runs fast.  Make everything resident and watch it fly.  Most of this 
speed comes from loading entire files into memory at once. This might 
present a memory problem, but in general DICE's memory usage is comparable 
to Lattice and Aztec.

- CODE SIZE is comparable with Lattice and Aztec, even better in many cases.
The minimum program sizes are as follows:

_main() { }          448    no stdio/fd
 main() { }         2736    some stdio
 main() { printf..} 5492    most of stdio

(12) EXTENSIONS , see EXTENSIONS.DOC.  DICE provides many extensions
 to C to support various AMIGAisms and ROM based code, including
 special treatment of the 'const' storage qualifier.

(13) The preprocessor is able to handle arbitrarily sized macros.  There
 are no limits to symbol or macro length.  The preprocessor is able to
 handle up to 64 levels of includes / macro recursions with arbitrary
 use of the string-ize (#) and token pasting (##) operators.

 The preprocessor implements the __BASE_FILE__ macro as well as all
 standard ANSI macros (__FILE__, __LINE__, __DATE__, __TIME__, ...)

(14) DICE supports the creation of residentable executables in nearly
 all cases (exception: using the __geta4 procedure qualifier
 precludes being able to make an executable resident, also non
 const __chip data... see EXTENSIONS.DOC)

 Not only is residentability supported, but it is supported
 without requiring the programmer to #include all sorts of
 prototype/pragma files.

(15) DICE supports the small-data model, large data model, small and
 large code models, and special data models (word absolute,
 absolute known address) for supporting ROMable code.  The linker
 automatically generates JMP tables when the small-code model is
 used in large executables.

(16) REGISTERED user's DICE supports __chip, __near, and __far keywords,
 as well as many others.

(17) Simplified library and startup module design.  There are no multiple
 versions of a single library for different memory models and the
 frontend, DCC, makes all library and startup module interaction
 except m.lib invisible.  The same c.o handles both resident and
 non-resident startup.  c.lib and m.lib may be used with programs
 that declare more than 64KBytes of BSS (though not with programs
 that declare more than 64KBytes of __near initialized storage).

 There is no large-data-model version of c.lib and m.lib,
 although you can easily recompile the libraries into a large-data
 model version if you wish.  I suggest that instead of doing that
 you stick with the small-data model and use the __geta4 type
 qualifier to procedures which are called out of context.

 The registered dist contains several source examples for libraries,
 dos handlers, exec devices, and printer drivers.

 (18) Optimization of args to prototyped routines

@ub}GOALS@{ub}

 In writing DICE my goals are as follows: @{i}Matt Dillion@{ui}

- reasonably fast compilation.  Modular executables for ease of use,
  reliability, and testability.

- concentrate more on reliability and less on optimizations.  Remember that
  this is only the third major distribution of DICE, I expect some bugs
  to show up.  I expect to become more reliable than the two other
  commercial C compilers in the Amiga market within a year.

- but do not forget optimizations... put in relatively easy to implement
  optimizations that do not destroy the reliability of DICE.  DICE does
  no common sub-expression or loop unrolling optimizations, but does do
  relatively smart register allocation and multi-level history to
  propogate conditional expressions.

- provide comprehensive support of the Amiga, especially for new
  versions of the OS that come out.  DICE fully supports 1.3 and 2.0
  with an easy extension mechanism to allow development on several
  OS versions / betas simultaniously.

- I have always torn my hair out at not being able to easily fix bugs in
  the support libraries for commercial compilers.  DICE includes full
  source for its support libraries (c.lib, m.lib, auto.lib) and a means
  to remake the library.  DICE also includes full source to some of
  its own utilities, namely LIBTOS and the DCC frontend which are the
  most likely candidates for programmer hair loss.

@{b}COMMENTS@{ub}

Registerized parameteres are now implemented.  The implementation
turned out to be not all that complex.  However, you cannot as yet
specify WHICH registers parameters are to be placed for a call.
Refer to the -mRR option in DCC.DOC

Inline library calls are not implemented.  Inline library calls are
actually useful and when properly implemented increase efficiency to
low level calls such as AddHead() and GetMsg().  Other calls such as
Move() and Draw() do not increase noticably in efficiency. #pragma's
must be used to define inline calls and this makes the compiler
enviroment less portable.  Lattice made a big mistake *requiring* the
use of inline library calls with residentable programs.  My solution
was to write a program to convert AMIGA**.LIB into a small-data version
of same called AMIGAS**.LIB.

DICE still uses tags for library calls, but fully registerized tags are
now available to registered users which significantly reduces library
call overhead to the point where it's only a few cycles slower than a
SAS/C inline call, and without the hassle.

Similarly, I have not implemented prototype and amiga-library function
array support in the compiler or linker but instead have provided
separate programs to aid in this.  While less automated than SAS/C,
this support is MUCH more portable and, in my opinion, much cleaner, as
well as more easily maintained.

In general, I refuse to implement a thousand nearly useless features
that will only introduce more bugs into the compiler.

@{b}ANSI C@{ub}

With structural returns and auto-aggregate is implemented, DICE is now
95% ANSI compliant.  Known differences are described in the KNOWNBUGS
document.

I spent a great deal of time ensuring that STDIO routines run
relatively fast.  I decided to write nearly all of the support library
in C instead of falling back to optimized assembly to keep the system
uniform and portable.  One does not notice much of a difference between
the C strcpy() and an assembly strcpy() relative to the run time of
their program.

@{b}AMIGA@{ub}

As said in feature (7), if you wish your program to be runnable from
the workbench you must supply a wbmain() entry point.  If you do not
then running the program from the workbench will result in its
immediate termination (e.g. nothing happens).  On return from wbmain()
or exit() the workbench message is automatically ReplyMsg()d by the
exit code.

DICE separates workbench startup and puts it in the hands of the user
to simplify the user's code.  Since there are two entry points,
main() for CLI run programs and wbmain() for WORKBENCH-run programs,
the programmer can more easily modularize his code.

The Registered release of DICE supports the __near, __far, and __chip
keywords.

@{b}UNBUFFERED CONSOLE IO@{ub}

You may set a console to RAW mode using the setbuf() and setvbuf() calls.
You may set a console back to COOKED mode using the same calls.

* NOTE, a common problem is that users have removed various floating
point libraries from LIBS: and this may prevent DC1 from running. Make
sure you have the full complement of floating point libraries in LIBS:

Another common problem is related to your PATH... if DCC is unable to
run one of the subprograms (DCPP, DC1, DAS, and DLINK) you may not have
DCC:BIN in your path.  ARP is known to screw things up in this regard
and if you are running ARP try de-installing it to see if that was the
problem.  You cannot use the ARP resident command (ARES) with DICE
executables.
