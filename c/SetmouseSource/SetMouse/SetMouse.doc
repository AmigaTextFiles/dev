SetMouse V2.0   © 1995 Ketil Hunn
---------------------------------

BACKGROUND
  SetMouse is part of the Recall package (the BEST reminder-utility
  available!), but is also released on its own.

  Intentionally constructed to control the mouse pointer from Recall
  input events (since the position of the mousepointer is not
  accessible through the rawmouse input class), but may also be useful
  for other purposes.

DESCRIPTION
  SetMouse will enable you to control the mouse pointer position from
  Shell and/or generate left, middle or right mouse button presses (or
  a combination of these).

  May also be used to centre the mouse pointer on screen at boot time
  (as in Windows) using the position -1,-1.

USAGE
  SetMouse XPOS=NUMBER/A/N,YPOS=NUMBER/A/N,LEFTBUTTON/S,MIDDLEBUTTON/S,
           RIGHTBUTTON/S,DOUBLECLICK/S

  XPOS          Horizontal mouse pointer position.
  YPOS          Vertical mouse pointer position.
  LEFTBUTTON    Generate a left mouse button press.
  MIDDLEBUTTON  Generate a middle mouse button press.
  RIGHTBUTTON   Generate a right mouse button press.
  DOUBLECLICK   Generate a doubleclick left/middle/right mouse button
                press.

EXAMPLES
  SetMouse 50 100              (move mouse pointer to X=50 Y=100)
  SetMouse XPOS=50 YPOS=100    (move mouse pointer to X=50 Y=100)
  SetMouse -1 -1               (centre mousepointer on screen)
  SetMouse 12 90 LEFTBUTTON    (move mouse pointer to X=12 Y=90 and
                                generate a right mouse button press)
