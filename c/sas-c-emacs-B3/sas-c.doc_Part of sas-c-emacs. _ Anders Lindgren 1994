			     INTRODUCTION

This package is the glue that ties the SAS/C message handler, SCMSG,
to GNUEmacs for automatic error message reporting. The package gives
Emacs all the knowledge about errors normally stored in the SCMSG
utility. It also enables SCMSG to automatically bring Emacs to the
front, place the cursor on the correct line in the correct file, and
display the error information in the minibuffer.

sas-c-mode is in GNU Emacs terms a minor mode. This means that it is
an addition to the current major mode, such as c-mode. When enabled
the text "SAS/C" will be present to the right of the the name of the
current mode. The sas-c-mode rebinds keys of the current local keymap,
when it is terminated the original definitions are restored.

The idea behind makeing sas-c-mode a minor, as opposed to major, mode
is to be able to use the features of c-mode. It can also be enabled
when editing smakefiles or assmebler files.


			     REQUIREMENTS

Atleast SAS/C V6.0 and Emacs V1.28 are required for this program.
However SAS/C V6.50 is recomended.


				FILES

Files contained in this package:

sas-c.doc		This file.
sas-c.el		Source code in elisp.
sas-c.elc		Byte-compiled version of the above.
SCMSG.opt.SC_EMACS	Options for SCMSG.
sc_emacs.rexx		Handler for SCMSG->Emacs communication.
quithost.rexx		Terminates sc_emacs.
slashquote/
  slashquote.library	A ARexx host library containing two functions.
  slashquote.doc	A small docfile for the above.
  slashquote.c		The sourcecode.
  slashquote.fd		Library description file, used by slink to build
			the library.
  smakefile		file containing rules for building 
			slashquote.library


			       INSTALL

* The library "slashquote.library" should be placed in LIBS:

* Place the file `sas-c-mode.elc' into a lisp directory (for 
  example GNUEmacs:lisp)

* Move sc_emacs.rexx and quithost.rexx to your rexx: directory.

* Copy SCMSG.opt.SC_EMACS to ENV:sc/SCMSG and ENVARC:sc/SCMSG.

* Turn on the ErrorRexx option in SCOPTS.

* The following line should be placed in s:.emacs

	(autoload 'sas-c-mode "sas-c" nil t)

* If you would like the sas-c-minor mode to be activated automagically
  when editing C-files, place the following lines into your s:.emacs

	(setq c-mode-hook 
	      (function (lambda ()
			  ;;; Other thing to do when entering 
			  ;;; c-mode goes here.
			  (sas-c-mode 1))))

	
If you know how to give the command "evaluate-region" on the lines
entered into s:.emacs, do it. Otherwise quit and restart emacs.


			       EXAMPLE

A normal sequence of events is the following:

* You compile a program, and an error occur. If no error occured, 
  something must be very unnormal :-)
* The SCMSG is started by the compiler, if it's option RexxOnly
  is activated, no window is opened.
* Automatically (if AUTOEDIT is enabled), or when an error is
  doubleclicked, the SC_EMACS host is started. (Please see the section
  `KNOWN PROBLEMS' below).
* Emacs is started, if it isn't already running.
* The cursor is placed on the correct line in the correct file
  and the current errormessage is displayed in the minibuffer.
* The message will disappear if the cursor is moved; press
  C-c C-l to redisplay it.
* Press C-c C-n to see next error, or C-c C-d to delete the current and
  see next.
* The SCMSG utility can be used to browse errors. Just doubleclick on
  the errors to edit it in Emacs.
* When done, press C-c C-c to rebuild the project.


				USAGE

The following keys are defined by default when sas-c-mode is
active:

C-c C-a		Display the alternative file, if any.
C-c C-c		Build a project (normally execute smake).
C-c C-d		Delete the current message and display next.
C-c C-h		Hide the SCMSG window.
C-c C-l		Redisplay current error message.
C-c C-n		Display next error message.
C-c <down>		---- " ----
C-c C-p		Display previous error message.
C-c <up>		---- " ----
C-c C-q		Remove all messages for a certain primary file.
C-c C-s		Show the SCMSG window.
C-c <		Go to the first error message.
C-c <sh. up>		---- " ----
C-c >		Go to the last error message.
C-c <sh. down>		---- " ----

When an error is displayed, the mark is set at the previous cursor
position. Press C-x C-x to return to the old position.


The message is displayed in the following forms:

	Class #: text

Where Class is "Error", "Warning" or "Info". # is the error number and
text is the actual message. If there exists an alternate file the string
"(Alt)" is placed immediately to the left of the colon. To see it, press
C-c C-a. The primary file can always be reviewed by pressing C-c C-l.


			      VARIABLES

sas-c-mode	non-nil if in sas-c minor mode. READ ONLY.

sas-c-compile-command
		Command to use when building project (default "sc:c/smake").


			      FUNCTIONS

sas-c-bottom	Go to the last message.

sas-c-build	Rebuild the current project. This is done by executing
		the command in the variable sas-c-compile-command.
		
sas-c-delete	Delete the current error message and move to the next.

sas-c-delcomp-current	
		Delete all messages with the same primary filename
		as the current error. NOTE: This function does not take
		the filename from the current buffer.
		Also note: This function is not bound to a key since
		I belive it's a little bit unintuitive.

sas-c-delcomp	Prompt for a for a filename to remove from the error list.
		Default is current buffer.

sas-c-delfile-current	
		Same as sas-c-delcomp-current, but for secondary file.

sas-c-delfile	Same as sas-c-delcomp, but for secondary filename.

sas-c-display-altfile
		This function displays the alternate file and places
		the cursor on the corrent line.

sas-c-display-error
		This function displays the current error and places the
		cursor on the offending line.

sas-c-hide	Close the SCMSG window.

sas-c-next	Move to the next error message.

sas-c-prev	move to the previous error message.

sas-c-show	Show the SCMSG window. If called with an argument
		the window gets unactivated. (i.e. call if called
		with C-u M-x sas-c-show RET.)

sas-c-top	Go to the top of error messages.


			    CUSTOMIZATION

The sac-c-mode can be custimized. a special variable sas-c-mode-hook
is defined for this purpose. It shall be defined as below:

(setq sas-c-mode-hook 
      (function (lambda ()
		  ;;; Things to do here
		  )))

When defining new keys the function sas-c-define-key must be used. If
not, the mechanism which removes the keybindings when sas-c-mode is
terminated won't work.

For example:

(setq sas-c-mode-hook 
      (function (lambda ()
		  (sas-c-define-key "\C-x`" 'sas-c-next)
		  (sas-c-define-key "\C-c\C-q" 'sas-c-delcomp-current))))

This defines C-x ` as sas-c-next. This is quite useful for people
who are used to the old "compile" macro. It also redefines the
key C-c C-q to use sas-c-delcomp-current, instead of sas-c-delcomp.


			     TIPS n'TRIX

If you are going to compile from within emacs, I recomend using
the NOERRORHIGHLIGHT and BATCH flags.

It is useful to be able to compile (C-c C-c) from a makefile. I normally
places the following lines into the header of the makefile to make it
use the sas-c minor mode:
(According to Emacs rules the local variables should be placed on
the last page of the file.)

#       Local Variables:
#       eval:(sas-c-mode 1)
#       End:


			    HOW TO EXPAND

sas-c-mode can be expanded with new clever commands, just start up
your brain!

The following ELisp functions can be useful:

(sas-c-view-message file line text class errnum)
	Display the actual error message. It reads in the file, if
	it's not in any buffer. It then shows the buffer and places
	the cursor on the correct line and displays the errortext.

(sas-c-get-file file)
	Used by above.

(sas-c-scmsg command)
	Send a ARexx command to SCMSG without requesting a resultstring.

(sas-c-scmsg-str command)
	Send a ARexx command to SCMSG and return the resultstring.

(sas-c-scmsg-str command)
	Send a ARexx command to SCMSG and return a number.


			    KNOWN PROBLEMS

1) SCMSG has given me quite a headache during the development due to a
unfoutnate combination of bad design and bugs. The main problem is
that the mechanism which calls the editor can't be used directly since
it often emits strings with quotes, resulting in syntactically
incorrect ELisp statements. It also only quotes filenames containing
spaces resulting in inconsistency when writing a template of the form:

	(sas-c-get-file "%f")

which is expanded into:

	(sas-c-get-file ""foo bar.c"")

which also is an incorrent ELisp statement.

The solution to the problem is the sc_emacs ARexx host which
translates all SCMSG messages into lisp statements.


2) When scmsg is started for the first time the option `AutoEdit' is
ignored. The result is that Emacs isn't activated until the second
compilation. A simple workaround is to start SCMSG once, before
starting to compile. If you compile a lot and you've got a lot of
memory you can start scmsg at boot time.

The following line does the trick:
	run scmsg HIDDEN


				 TODO

Sometime, I would like to write an installer script and to TeXInfo:ify
this documentation. However, I have been waiting for some spare time
to do it on the past six months, without luck. Finally I decided that
you folks probably would like to have it even without the fancy
stuff...  and here it is.

When is V1.0 about to come? Soon, I just want to run this one through
the toughest test avaiable; the Amiga development community.

			     FINAL WORDS

I would like to thank the guys at SAS, especially Doug Walker and
James Cooper, for their GREAT C compiler environment and their immense
support. 

The english probably contains a lot of spelling and gramatical errors,
please consider that english is not my native toung. Should somebody
find the time to correct the language, nobody would appreciate it
more than myself.

Suggestions, new ideas and (positive) criticism are highly
appreciated. Please email them to:
