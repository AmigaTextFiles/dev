    A 'popup menu' is a quick menu which appears when you click the right
    mouse button on a particular window. In PureBasic, you can attach
    one popup menu per window which allow you to do context sensitive
    menu. The nice popupmenu.library is used to achieve that, so if you
    decide to use these functions, doesn't forget to include this library
    in your final package, as it's not a 'standard' library.
