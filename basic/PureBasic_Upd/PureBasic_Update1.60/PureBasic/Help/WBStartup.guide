  @{b}PureBasic WBStartup library@{ub}

    This library is a bit special as it contains only one command.
    It is designed to allow a program to be started from an icon
    from the Workbench. The Workbench requires a special procedure
    to know which programs have been launched and also to do some
    special operations if needed (like dropping an icon over
    another...)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  WBStartup() adds the needed code to allow your program to be launched from
  a Workbench icon. It returns a value that indicates whether the program
  was launched from the CLI or from the Workbench.

    If StartMode <> 0, program is launched from Workbench, else from CLI.



  Note for advanced programmers :
  -------------------------------

    WBStartup() returns the pointer to the WBMessage structure. You can use it
  to get your required information.
