@NODE INTRO "What's a map editor?"
  @{FG SHINE}@{U}@{B}What the Hell's a Map Editor?@{UB}@{UU}@{FG TEXT}

    Basically it's an editor that allows piece smaller chunks of
  graphics to make up a whole screen. In the case of this editor,
  it allows you to piece Blitz2 shapes onto a backdrop of any size
  you find suitable.
  @{I}  e.g. Imagine you have 100 shapes containing the images of paths,
  grass, trees and water. You could piece these together to give the
  impression of a park.@{UI}

    This is a very common method used in 2D scrolling games where the
  play area is very much larger than the screen. As the player walks
  along, new scenery is drawn slightly off screen and scrolled into
  view.
    @{I}e.g. Faery Tale Adventure, Chaos Engine on the Amiga and even more
    modern affairs such as Loaded and Diablo use this style.@{UI}

    Simon's MappED will allow you to create such enormous maps to use
  in your own @{I}(Presumably Blitz2)@{UI} games.

@NODE REQUIREMENTS "Can I run this thing?"
  @{FG SHINE}@{U}@{B}Requirements?@{UB}@{UU}@{FG TEXT}

    To be honest I've no idea what other systems it runs under, because I
  know no-one else who owns an Amiga.

    I know in theory what it @{i}should @{ui} run under.

  @{fg highlight}Operating Systems@{fg text}
    @{B}OS 3.0@{UB} or above is required for the Intuition the program uses.

  @{fg highlight}Memory@{fg text}
    @{B}2MB Chip RAM@{UB} is plenty for most map editing. Of course it
  doesn't hurt to have a wad of Fast RAM, but at a push I think this could
  run with just 1MB of Chip RAM.

  @{fg highlight}Processor@{fg text}
    It's a very stable program, but not blindingly fast, as is the way
  of all intuition based programs. Vanilla A1200 users will find this
  sluggish so any processor lower than an 68030 requires patience.
    Works fine and dandy on my '040/40mhz though.

    If it works under a system I haven't mentioned here, or indeed
  if you find any bugs, please write and tell @{"me" LINK ME} about it.

@NODE INSTALL "How do I Install this?"
  @{fg highlight}@{B}@{U}Installation@{UU}@{UB}@{fg text}

  Just drag the MappED drawer to wherever you want on your harddisk.
    If you want it to run from floppy then format a disk with an
  install bootblock and expand this archive straight into the root of DF0:

  Make sure you install the following libraries, in @{B}LIBS:@{UB}
   @{FG FILL} asl.library
    diskfont.library
    mathtrans.library
    reqtools.library@{FG TEXT}


  And also copy Dpaint.font into @{B}FONTS:@{UB}
    If you've installed Deluxe Paint on your harddisk it will be
  there already.

    These are fairly common, and you should probably own them already.

  After that, you are ready to run.

    To run the MappED Either:-

    @{I}* Double click on the Workbench Icon
    * Go the the appropriate CLI drawer and type MappED@{UI}

@ENDNODE

@NODE FEATURES "Why's this any good?"
  @{FG SHINE}@{B}@{U}Features...@{UU}@{UB}@{FG TEXT}
    * Everything is Intuition friendly, with Gadtools, ASL and Menus.
    * Menu's mean novices can get quickly to grips with the MappED.
    * Keyboard shortcuts are included for experienced users.
    * Undo and Erase functions.
    * Quick and versitile shape selection.
    * Maps can be drawn with "depths" allowing for foreground and background.
    * 32000x32000 pixels of map. over 100 times the
        standard width and height of a physical lo-res screen.
    * Maps can have an IFF background underlying the them.
    * Saves your last working directories, allowing to quickly re-access
        the last files you were working on.

@NODE MAP "The .MAP file format"
  @{FG SHINE}@{U}@{B}Using the .MAP format@{UB}@{UU}@{FG TEXT}
    The standard .MAP format is a fairly simple text file with keywords
  to declare details of the map.
    You can use this description to write the code you need to
  load the map data into you're programs.
    Here is a line by line summary of the .MAP format.

  @{B}* The file begins with a remark declaring the file to be MappED file.@{UB}
    @{I}If the file is in Mki$ format it will be noted after this rem.@{UI}
  @{B}* A remark naming describing the following map.@{UB}
  @{B}* A remark identifying the game/utility the map is intended for.@{UB}
  @{B}* A remark declaring the author of the map.@{UB}
  @{B}* Keyword "WIDTH:"@{UB}
  @{B}* the map's width parameter@{UB}
  @{B}* Keyword "HEIGHT:"@{UB}
  @{B}* the map's height parameter@{UB}
  @{FG FILL}If a background is used in the map add the following...@{FG TEXT}
    @{B}* Keyword "BACK:"@{UB}
    @{B}* the background's AmigaDOS path@{UB}
    @{B}* the background's AmigaDOS filename@{UB}
  @{FG FILL}If a palette used in the map add the following...@{FG TEXT}
    @{B}* Keyword "PALETTE:"@{UB}
    @{B}* the palette's AmigaDOS path@{UB}
    @{B}* the palette's AmigaDOS filename@{UB}
  @{B}* Keyword "SHAPE:"@{UB}
  @{B}* the shape's AmigaDOS path@{UB}
  @{B}* the shape's AmigaDOS filename@{UB}
  @{FG FILL}It's possible for several set of shapes to be defined here@{FG TEXT}
  @{B}* Keyword "MAP:"@{UB}

    Following the keyword MAP: follows is the @{I}map data.@{UI}
  It's simply a list of a shape number, an X co-ord and a Y co-ord.

    If the map is saved in layers you'll see the @{B}Keyword "LAYER "@{UB} plus
  a number for which layer follows. The number begins at one each
  time a new layer starts the number increases.

 @{I} N.B. If the map is saved without notes or layers then only a list of a
  shape number, an X co-ord and a Y co-ord is saved in the file.@{UI}

  @{FG FILL}In the examples/ drawer there is a .MAP file to look at.@{FG TEXT}

@NODE DISCLAIM "Covering my ass..."
  @{fg highlight}@{B}@{U}Legal Disclaimer@{UU}@{UB}@{fg text}

  To the best of my knowledge, MappED is completely OS friendly
and creates perfectly useable map data, so there should be absolutely
no danger to your Amiga.

  If, however as a result of using MappED your Amiga should become
host to a @{I}Candarian Demon@{UI} who taunts you with voices urging you to @{FG FILL}@{B}kill@{UB}@{FG TEXT}
your friends and family I accept no responsibility.

  I also accept no responsibility for anything else which goes wrong as
a result of MappED.

  Of course, I hope everything is fine. Good Luck and I hope you find this
program at least half as useful as I do.

@NODE HISTORY "MappED History"
  @{B}V1.0, May 1994@{UB}
      Written just for the creation of a platform game @{I}(ZX81)@{UI} that I never
    finished and never will. The editor was a Blitz mode affair with
    no grid and a very suspect erase function which required pixel
    perfect clicking. No undo was included making map-making a
    harrowing business. Still, with patience you could make single
    screens (320x256) from the one set of shapes it let you use.

  @{B}V2.0, September 1994@{UB}
      I updated my ZX81 editor for use with an overhead Zelda style
    game I had planned. It was still the attrocious Blitz mode
    monstrosity, but undo was now included and a 16x16 grid could
    be used. The source code had to be altered to use different shapes
    in your maps.

  @{B}V3.0, March 1995@{UB}
      Another update for another game. The big step this time was
    allowing to select which game you were editing maps for. Sadly
    though it was from a pre-programmed list that had to be updated
    whenever files were changed or shifted. The grid was now versatile
    and maps bigger than the screen could be created.

  @{B}V4.0, July 1996@{UB}
      At last I attempt the awkward shift into Amiga mode and the
    world of intuition. The result is a hideous lethargic beast,
    that although friendlier than it's predecessors was simply to slow
    to use.

  @{B}V5.0, September 1998@{UB}
      At long last, an editor that is both friendly and multi-tasking.
    more versitile and better presented and much faster.

  @{B}V5.1, November 1998@{UB}
    Cleaned up a major bug in the scrolling. Stopped duplicate shapes
  landing on the same co-ordinates. Added extra keyboard shortcuts.

  @{B}V5.2, December 1998@{UB}
    Killed a major bug in the erasing of map blocks.

  @{B}v5.3, February 1999@{UB}
    Added Iconify option. 
    Added a (very slow) 'View map' option
 
  @{B}v5.4, February 1999@{UB}
    Fixed bug in the select shape window.
    Shapes can now be selected by double click.

  @{B}v5.5, April 2000@{UB}
    Improved editing of multiple layered maps, you can now view and
  edit single layers instead of viewing all layers at once.

@NODE BUGS "bugs. Bugs. BUGS. BUUUUUGS!"
@{B}@{FG SHINE}@{U} Known Bugs @{UU}@{FG TEXT}@{UB} 

@{B}Crash@{UB}
  This is an odd one. If you've had a few programs in the memory before
running MappED it might freeze permanently when you highlight shapes.
On other amiga's it can sometimes freeze on boot-up.
  Oddly, once the program is up and running and you've already
highlighted some shapes it never crashes and works just fine.
  More oddly however, I have had reports that loading Dpaint and quitting
it before running MappED, ensures that it runs smoothly and never crashes.
@{I}How odd.@{UI}  

@{B}Undo@{UB}
  Switching between erase and draw and using undo a lot will sometimes
cause oddness in the undo function overall. Nothing serious just odd.

  If you experience any more bugs, or think you know what's causing these
please tell @{"me" LINK ME}.
