[This is a copy of the document I received from Carolyn Scheppner along
 with the disk.  Any errors that have occured in the process of typing it
 in are mine...  You can create a demo disk by cloning a working AmigaBasic
 disk, deleting the basicdemos and tfiles directories, and overlaying
 whats left with the contents of this directory via a command of the
 form "copy AmigaLibDisk27:ABdemos df1: all"     Fred Fish  28-Jun-86]


Enclosed is a disk containing my AmigaBasic demos.  For distribution,
I removed AmigaBasic from the disk and replaced it with an icon:

		 ----------------
		<		<
		 \    NOTICE!	 \
		  >		  >
		  ----------------
		CopyAmigaBasicHere

The disk is 67% full.   There are seven sample screens on the disk which
are referred to by the programs.

The disk contains:

 BasicDemos Directory:

    NewConvertFd ------	Creates .bmaps from fd files, prepending an "x"
			to any system function name that conflicts with
			an AmigaBasic keyword.

    BitPlanes ---------	Finds addresses of and writes directly to the
			bitplanes of the screen's bitmap.


 LibDemos directory:

    AboutBmaps --------	Short tutorial on the creation and use of bmaps.
			(Basic listing)

    LoadILBM-SaveACBM -	Loads and displays an IFF ILBM pic such as those
			created with GraphiCraft, DPaint or Images.
			Demos color cycling if a GraphiCraft CCRT chunk
			is found.  Optionally saves the screen as an 
			ACBM (Amiga Contiguous BitMap) file.  An ACBM
			file can be loaded more quickly by Basic.

    LoadACBM ----------	Loads and displays an ACBM pic file.

    SaveILBM ----------	Creates a demo screen and saves it as an ILBM
			file, readable by GraphiCraft, DPaint, and Images.

    ScreenPrint -------	Creates a demo screen and dumps the screen to a 
			graphic printer.

    exec.bmap
    dos.bmap
    graphics.bmap -----	Bmaps required by the demos in this directory.
			(1.1 bmaps created with NewConvertFD)


 OtherBmaps directory:

    (various)  --------	Bmaps for other system libraries.
			(1.1 bmaps created with NewConvertFD)
