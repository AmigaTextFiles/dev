'BMAPS  ---  C. Scheppner   CBM  05/86
'
'  The Bmap directory contains .bmaps
'created with NewConvertFD using the
'FD files found on the 1.1 Amiga C disk.
'
'  These .bmaps make it possible for
'you to call Amiga system routines
'from an AmigaBasic program.
'
'  Three of the .bmaps have been placed
'in the LibDemos directory because they
'are needed by the some of the demo
'programs there.
'(graphics, dos, and exec .bmaps)
'
'
'PLACEMENT OF BMAPS
'
'  When you use the LIBRARY statement,
'AmigaBasic looks for a .bmap file
'for that library.  It will look in two
'places for the .bmap:
'
'   1. The libs: directory
'      (Usually the libs directory of the
'      workbench disk you booted with.)
'
'   2. The directory AmigaBasic is
'      cd'd to.
'      When you enter AmigaBasic, this is
'      the directory (drawer) containing
'      the icon you double clicked.
'      You can cd to a different directory
'      with the CHDIR command.
'
'   To run the demos in the LibDemos drawer,
'EITHER doubleclick the demo's icon
'OR   - doubleclick AmigaBasic
'     - type  CHDIR "df1:LibDemos" <RETURN>
'         in the Output window
'     - Open the desired demo
'     - Start the demo
'
'
'CONFLICTING ROUTINES / KEYWORDS
'
'  NewConvertFD prepends an 'x' to
'any Amiga system routine name that
'conflicts with an AmigaBasic keyword.
'
'  The known conficting routine
'names can be found in data statements
'at the end of NewConvertFD.
'
'  Using these .bmaps, the conflicting
'system routines may be declared
'and called by prepending an 'x' to
'the routine name. (ex. xRead)
'All other system routines are
'declared/called by their original
'names.
'
'Note:
'   The dos_lib.fd file on the
' Amiga C disk had a bad line that
' I had to correct (using ED) before
' using NewConvertFD on it.
' I changed:  ##bias 5*6
'        to:  ##bias 30
