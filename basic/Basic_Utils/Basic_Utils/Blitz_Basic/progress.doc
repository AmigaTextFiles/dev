Progress.doc
============

The »ProgressXXX« listings contain three statements:

  openprogwindow {"Window title"}
  -------------------------------

  This statement opens the window of the progress indicator.

  Note: If you want the window to be centered on the screen, add these lines to the statement:

        X.l = (WBWidth - 163) / 2
        Y.l = (WBHeight - 37) / 2

        Change the 100,100 in the line beginning with WINDOW piw by X.l,Y.l.

  drawprogind {percent.l}
  -----------------------

  This statement draws the progress indicator bar. Percent.l can be obtained by using an equation
  similar to this one:

    percent.l = (current * 100) / total

  *** OR ***

    percent.l = ((current - start) * 100) / (end - start)

  closeprogind {}
  ---------------

  This statement closes the window of the progress indicator.

                                            CAUTION
                                            -------

All statements use the highest possible window number (= Maximum Window - 1).
