NAP is a preprocessor which has been developed especially
for the ACE programming language.

Features : - processing of the following preprocessor
             commands: IF, ELSE, ELIF, ENDIF, INCLUDE,
             DEFINE, IFDEF, IFNDEF, UNDEF
           - removal of C comments, e.g. /*   */, AND
             ACE comments, e.g. {   } and '.
           - removal of unused structures (thus gaining
             memory during compilation)

Changes  : - more optimized -> faster
           - added -x Option (see manual)
           - changed default configuration
           - fixed some bugs
           - default defines, e.g. __TIME and __DATE
           - extended manual



  Happy ACEing ;-)
