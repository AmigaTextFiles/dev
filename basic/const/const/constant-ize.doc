============
Constant-Ize
============

Ultra small program for converting lists of things into constant lists for
HiSoft Basic 2, a bit like enums, but const is much nicer :-)

First make a nice list of anything you want to turn into a list of stuff.
This list can contain anything, but make sure it is all valid as variable
names.  You do not need to include any nasty '%' signs.  I really hate
typing them.

Then run 'constant-ize <filename>' and a few seconds later you will suddenly
have a couple of new files in the same directory.

'<filename>_h.bas' is the real file of usefullness.  It contains the list of
constants you want to include in your program.  You can then do stuff
without remembering tedious stuff like offsets.

'<filename>_sub.bas' is a quick subroutine that may come in handy.  I like
loading a string array with the same contents as the constants so I can
print what it is without doing a million 'if' statements.

I have included a quick sample about cars.
	<cars>		The source file containing all those interesting
			vehicles 
	<cars_h.bas>	Generated constant files
	<cars_sub.bas>	generated subroutine to load up the cars into an
			array. 

I hope you find this program usefull, I know I do a LOT of this sort of
thing, and have been continuously alarmed by the lack of good code
generating utilities for HBasic2.  The only other one I know of at this time
is 'ConvertiILBM' by Massimo Tantignone, which converts iff files into
something more usable.  'aminet/gfx/conv/c_ilbm21.lha'  If you have any cool
code generators, please upload them.  Please send me the url as well !
