                       .:! WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? !:.

Some months ago I started writing on a cargame in the style of Lotus in
BB2.  But other projects (PIV & PlubZ) caught my attention, so I forgot
about this game.   Today when I was looking through all my old projects
to see if there was something worth developing, I found the  darn  game
again.  I looked at it for a while, and said "Oh, what a mess...". So I
decided to spread the source out instead of doing something about it.
   If you find something joyful in the code you may feel free to use it
and develop it. In my eyes, the code is very old (I didn't know how  to
code  during  that  good  ol'  time ;-) and messy, but still it's not a
complete waste of bytes.

Anyway... Send me an e-mail if you make a game out of it :) Not that  I
want any credits, but it's always nice to know!
