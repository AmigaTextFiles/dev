  @{b}Pure Basic - File library V1.00@{ub}

    The file is the main way of storage for nowadays computers.
    With the PureBasic you manage them in very simple and optimized
    way. Any number of files can be handled at the same time. This
    library use buffered functions to increase the writing/reading
    speed.

@ENDNODE


@NODE CloseFile

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  CloseFile(#File)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Close the specified #File and it can't be used anymore for later use.
  Closing a file ensure the buffer will be put effictively on the disk.

  Note: on the program end, Pure Basic is smart enough to close all
        the unclosed files, so you don't need to do it yourself.

@ENDNODE


@NODE CreateFile

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Result = CreateFile(#File, FileName$)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Open an empty file. If the file was existing, it open it and replace it
  by a blank one ! Careful. If 'Result' is not null, the file is effectively
  created and you get the AmigaOS pointer to the file (for advanced programmers).
  If Result is NULL, the creation has failed. It must be always tested, as
  performing operations on a non created file will cause severe crashs.

@ENDNODE


@NODE DeleteFile

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Result = DeleteFile(FileName$)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Delete the specified 'Filename$'. You can give the full path and filename
  or only the filename (then the current directory will be used). If the
  result is NULL, then the filename hasn't been deleted.

@ENDNODE


@NODE Eof

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Result = Eof()

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Eof stands for 'End Of File'. It will return true if you have reached the
  end of the current file, NULL else.

@ENDNODE


@NODE FileSeek

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  FileSeek(NewPosition)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  It designed to change the current pointer position inside the file.

@ENDNODE


@NODE InitFile

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Result = InitFile(#NumMaxFiles)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  With init all the file envirronement for future use. You must call this function
  before any other file functions.

  #NumMaxFiles = Number of maximum files you need to handle simultanely.

@ENDNODE


@NODE Loc

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Position = Loc()

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Return the actual pointer position inside the file.

@ENDNODE


@NODE Lof

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Length = Lof()

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Lof stands for 'Length Of File'. It will return the length of the current
  file.

@ENDNODE


@NODE MakeDirectory

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Result = MakeDirectory(Path$)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Create the directory given in the Path$. If the result is NULL, then
  the directory can't be created.

@ENDNODE


@NODE OpenFile

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Result = OpenFile(#File, FileName$)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  It will open the designed file or create it if it doesn't exists. You can
  perform read and write on this file. If 'Result' is not null, the file
  is effectively opened and you get the AmigaOS pointer to the file
  (for advanced programmers). If Result is NULL, the creation has failed.
  It must be always tested, as performing operations on a non created file
  will cause severe crashs.

@ENDNODE


@NODE ReadByte

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Number.b = ReadByte()

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Read one byte on the current opened file.

@ENDNODE


@NODE ReadFile

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Result = ReadFile(#File, FileName$)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Open an existing file for read only operations. If 'Result' is not null, the file
  is effectively opened and you get the AmigaOS pointer to the file (for advanced programmers).
  If Result is NULL, the file is not found or can't be opened. It must be always tested, as
  performing operations on a non created file will cause severe crashs.

@ENDNODE


@NODE ReadLong

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Number.l = ReadLong()

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Read one long on the current opened file.

@ENDNODE


@NODE ReadString

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Text.s = ReadString()

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Read one string on the current opened file.

@ENDNODE


@NODE ReadWord

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  Number.w = ReadWord()

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Read one word on the current opened file.

@ENDNODE


@NODE RenameFile

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  RenameFile(OldFilename$, NewFilename$)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Rename a file. If the result is NULL, then the file can't be renamed.

@ENDNODE


@NODE UseFile

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  UseFile(#File)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  It change the current used file to the given one.

@ENDNODE


@NODE WriteByte

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  WriteByte(Number)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  with write feature (ie: not with ReadFile()).

@ENDNODE


@NODE WriteLong

    @{b}Syntax@{ub}

  WriteLong(Number)

    @{b}Description@{ub}

  Write a long number inside the current file. File must be opened
  with write feature (ie: not with ReadFile()).

@ENDNODE
