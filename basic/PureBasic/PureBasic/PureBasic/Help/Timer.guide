    This timer library is a good way to get very short but accurate
    ellapsed time between two part of your program. If you need to
    know how many time take a subroutine to be performed, this library
    is the only way. It can be used for short or long timing.
    This function is not dependent of the processor so the results
    should be the same on slow and fast Amigas.

@Node InitTimer

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  @{b}Result@{ub}.l = InitTimer()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  This is the init routine that always should be called
  befor any other functions.

  @{b}Result@{ub}
  If this is TRUE the Timer environment is correctly
  initialized but if it's instead FALSE no other

@Node StartTimer

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  @{b}Result@{ub}.l = StartTimer()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  This function start the timer.

  @{b}Result@{ub}
  This could be used in calculations to
  find out how many seconds that the
  result from StopTimer() contain.

@Node StopTimer

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  @{b}Result@{ub}.l = StopTimer()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  This function stop the timer.

  @{b}Result@{ub}
  The time that have past since
  StartTimer() was called.
