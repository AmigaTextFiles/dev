    AmigaSprites are kind of 'Sprites' (see the Sprites chapter)
    with some particularities. First, the AmigaSprites are fully
    handled by the Amiga hardware, so they are very fast, much
    faster than normal sprites. But it could have only 8 AmigaSprites
    displayed at the same time. The number of colours for each
    sprite is limited to 4. In other hand, each sprite can have an
    unlimited height and upto 64 pixels width (on AGA Amiga).

@NODE AmigaSpriteScreen

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  AmigaSpriteScreen(ScreenID)

    @{b}COMMAND@{ub}
  Set the screen on which the AmigaSprites will be displayed.
  You can easely get the ScreenID value by using the 'ScreenID()'
  command.

@ENDNODE


@NODE ChangeAmigaSpriteResolution

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  ChangeAmigaSpriteResolution(NewResolution)

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  One of the great feature of the AmigaSprites is the possibility to change
  theirs resolutions, independantly of the screen mode. For example, you can
  display an 'Hi-Res' sprite (640 pixels width like screen) on a standard PAL
  (320 pixels width) screen. You can call this command only if you have called
  the command 'AmigaSpriteScreen()'. This command only affect the sprite width,
  not the sprite height.

    Possible 'NewResolution' values:

        1: Low-Resolution sprite width      ( 320*x screen like)
        2: Hi-Resolution sprite width       ( 640*x screen like)
        3: Super Hi-Resolution sprite width (1280*x screen like)

@ENDNODE


@NODE DisplayAmigaSprite

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  DisplayAmigaSprite(#AmigaSprite, Channel, x, y)

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  Display the specified AmigaSprite on the given position on the current AmigaSprite
  screen (set with the 'AmigaSpriteScreen()' command). There is 8 channels and
  each channel can display 1 AmigaSprite. You can not display 2 Sprites on the
  same channel at the same time. Channels values are from 0 to 7.

  Note: AmigaSprites are always displayed over the graphics without destroy them.
        There is no need to save/restore the background like in regular sprites.

@ENDNODE


@NODE FreeAmigaSprite

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  FreeAmigaSprite(#AmigaSprite)

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  Remove the specified AmigaSprite from memory. You can no more use it.

@ENDNODE


@NODE InitAmigaSprite

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  Result = InitAmigaSpriteFile(#MaxAmigaSprites)

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  Init all the AmigaSprite environments for later use.  You  must  put  this
  function at the top of your source code if you want to use the AmigaSprite
  commands. You can test the result to see if the AmigaSprite environment
  has been correctly initialized. If not, quit the program or disable
  all the calls to the AmigaSprite related commands.

@ENDNODE


@NODE LoadAmigaSprite

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  Result = LoadAmigaSprite(#AmigaSprite, FileName$)

    @{b}STATEMENT@{ub}
  Load the specified AmigaSprite into the memory for immediate use. The AmigaSprite
  must be in IFF/ILBM format (compressed or not, both cases are supported).
  The AmigaSprites are always stored in Chip-Ram, in uncompressed form.
  The sprite width is limited to 16 (on OCS/ECS chipset) or to 64 (on AGA chipset).
  If the loaded sprite is too large, it will be automatically cutted to 64 pixels.
  The sprite height is not limited.

  If something wrong happens, a negative or null value is returned. Here are
  all the possible errors values:

     0 : Not enough memory
    -1 : File not found or can't be opened.
    -2 : This file is not an IFF/ILBM file
    -3 : Corrupted IFF/ILBM file
