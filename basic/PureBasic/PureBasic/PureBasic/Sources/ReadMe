     PureBasic v4.00 for AmigaOS - OpenSources libraries and tools
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Introduction

  As the AmigaOS version of PureBasic is not actively supported anymore, we 
decided to open as much code as we could do. Therefore, the whole commandset 
of PureBasic (beware, written completely in 680x0 assembly), the IDE and some 
other tools are available for modification. As the compiler source is shared 
between all the versions of PureBasic, it remains closed. If you do a bug fix, 
an improvement or anything else which could make PureBasic for AmigaOS better, 
don't hesitate to send us your patch, it will be included in the next release. 
We don't plan to to work on the AmigaOS libraries anymore, but the compiler 
has been ported using the lastest v4.00 branch, so we will support any future 
version of the compiler, but without implementing CPU specific features. For 
example, the "Macros" are available on AmigaOS 4.00 compiler, as it's a 
compiler feature, but "quad" and "double" are not, as they need a CPU specific
implementation.


II. Details on the sources

  - The libraries sources can be found in the "Assembly" drawer. To compile one
library, you will need PhxAss. Then, just use the following commandline:

  PhxAss Window.asm TO PureBasic:PureLibraries/ OPT=3

  - The IDE sources can be found in the BlitzBasic/ drawer and needs AmiBlitz 
(or BlitzBasic 2, not really sure about this, Doobrey more infos please !). 
The sources are in ascii format so it should be possible to recompile it :). 
It needs the NCS for BlitzBasic 2.

  - The Debugger source is found in the PureBasic/ directory. It needs this
version of the compiler to compile and run. After an overlooking these last days,
the debugger suffers from serious problem, especially the fact it reads the source
code directly from the IDE text linked list.. So it's not possible to debug
multi-files sources or debug from the commandline.

  - The keymaker and some other tools have been included as well.


III. PureBasic v4.00 AmigaOS limitations

  Here are a few compiler features not supported (and probably will never be):

    - ReDim not supported
    - Local arrays, and local lists not supported
    - Array and Lists parameters not supported
    - Float, Quad and Double not supported
    - No multi "Case" for "Select"
    - No unicode and threadsafe support
    - Probably a lot more...


IV. Final words

  Having working the last week on the port on the new v4 branch of
PureBasic was quite fun and brought back some nice memories :). In 2006, and
still messing with 680x0 code, that's what i call a journey in the past. We
hope you will find the code useful and/or funny to read (well, i'm not
especially proud of it, so be kind ;-). And don't hesitate to contact
us if you have some questions, at support@purebasic.com.

    Have fun !
