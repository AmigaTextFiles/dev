@NODE INTRO "Introduction"

   @{b}Introduction :@{ub}

   PureBasic is a new "high level" programming language based on established 
   "BASIC" rules. It is compatible with any other "BASIC" compiler, whether its
   for the Amiga or PC format. Learning PureBasic is very easy! PureBasic has been 
   created for beginner and expert alike. Compilation time is really fast.

   This software has been developed for the Amiga with the Amiga environment
   in mind. We have put a lot of effort into its realization to produce a fast,
   reliable and system friendly language. The respect of the OS is always the
   watchword. You cannot write bad software with the basic command set provided.
   Of course, you can also add new functions to bash the hardware and utilise
   the Amiga's full potential if you need to.

   The syntax is easy and the possibilities are huge with the "advanced" functions 
   that have been added to this language like pointers, structures, procedures, 
   dynamically linked lists and much more. For the experienced coder there are
   no problems gaining access to any of the legal OS structures or Amiga objects.

   PureBasic supports the 680x0 processor and, very shortly, PowerPC. The PowerPC 
   processor option is not yet fully implemented but it is hoped that this will
   be fully supported after further necessary testing.
   The 68000 option has been optimized to create the best code possible, however 
   we are sure we can do even better! We will keep trying!


   The main features of PureBasic:

     - 68000 and 68020+ support (PowerPC support in progress).
     - Built-in arrays, dynamically linked lists, complex structures, pointers
       and variable definitions.
     - Supported types: Byte (8 bits), Word (16 bits), Long (32 bits) and also user
       defined (structures).
     - Signed and unsigned support for standard types.
     - Built-in string types.
     - Constants, binary and hexadecimal numbers supported.
     - Expression reducer by grouping constants and numeric numbers together.
     - Standard arithmetic support in respect of sign priority and parenthesis:
       +, -, /, *, and, or, lsl, asl, lsr, asr.
     - Compile 30,000 lines/min using a 68030/50 (with PoolMem installed).
     - Procedure support for structured programming with local and global 
       variables (work still in progress).
     - All Standard BASIC keywords: If-Else-EndIf, Repeat-Until, etc.
     - External library support to manipulate objects like IFF pictures,
       screens, windows, gadgets, etc.
     - AmigaOS libraries fully supported as if they were BASIC keywords
     - Assembler Inline
     - Precompiled structures with constants files for extra fast compilation.
     - Debugger to stop programme execution and trace bugs easily.
     - Configurable CLI compiler.
     - System friendly, easy to install and always under development.
