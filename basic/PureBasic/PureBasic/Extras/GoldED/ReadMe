  This plugin for GoldED has been developped by Julian Kinraid.
  It allows to highlight in differents colours the commands,
  comments, string, constants and numeric numbers of PureBasic
  syntax.

  Installation:

    Copy the 2 files 'Commands.txt' and 'PureBasic.parser' into
    your 'GoldED:Syntax/' directory. Select PureBasic.parser in
    the Syntax menu and select the colour you need for each
    elements.


  Big thanks to him to let us include it freely in the main
  PureBasic package.

  If you have ideas to improve it, mail him to:
