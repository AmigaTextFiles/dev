   The PureBasic Sprite Grabber allows you to load an IFF picture and
   grab the sprites from it. It outputs standard PureBasic sprite files
   using the SaveSprites() function. You can grab both tiles and normal
   sprites that are sourounded by boxes.

@NODE USAGE "Usage"

  @{b}Usage@{ub}

  At startup a screen should be opened and you'll see a control window
  on the upper left corner. First click on the "Load picture" button to
  load an IFF picture. After the screen has re-opened you'll see the
  a window with the picture inside. Now you have two options:

  * click on "Grab tiles"
    to grab tiles from the picture starting at position 0, 0. Each tile
    will have the width of the number stored in the "Width" gadget and
    the height of the number stored in the "Height" gadget.

  * click on "Grab sprites"
    to grab sprites from the picture that a sourounded by boxes.
    These boxes must be in the colour stored in the "Colour" gadget.

  The sprites are then saved in the file you choose with the icon
  stored in default_icon.info, in case the option "save icon" in the
  menu is activated. Of course you can exchange or delete this file
  if you want to.

  The "remove cookies" option allows you to save sprites without cookies.
  These are only required if you use AddSprite() and AddBufferedSprite(),
  ie. sprites with a transparent colour. Without the cookies files are
  faster to load and need less disk space.

  To load the sprites just use the LoadSprites() function.
