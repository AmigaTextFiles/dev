@NODE INTRO "Introduction"

    @{b}Introduction:@{ub}

  Because all the libraries on the Amiga are released
  for the C/C++ langage format, PureBasic users need to
  convert some files before they can use the library.

  At this moment, OpenPureBasic enter the game. It will
  simply take your include file and convert it in
  PureBasic format. Only that :-). The result is near
  from perfect for about all includes files I've test
  (some bugs persist...). You must do the needed
  corrections by hands.

@NODE HOWUS "How To Use It"

    @{b}How To Use It:@{ub}

  Launch the program, and a little window will ask you
  what you want to do. OpenPureBasic can operate in two
  ways:

    + Convert a single file (self explanatory)

    + Convert a whole drawer:
  In this mode, all the files are converted, without any
  distinctions. Very usefull for large convert (ie:
  the Rom Kernal Manual includes files...:-)

  All the files are outputed in the 'Ram:T/' drawer. 

@ENDNODE


@NODE SPEED "Limitations"

    @{b}Limitations:@{ub}

  OpenPureBasic has been written to convert header files, not standard
  C/C++ programs. So don't claim me that it doesn't convert Netscape
  Comunicator C++ source correctly into PureBasic code..

  + 'Union' stuffs within structures aren't converted
  + Fixed string can be changed as the convertor doens't take
    care if the info is inside a string or outside.

@NODE FUTUR "Future plans"

    @{b}Future plans:@{ub}

  Make a more and more accurate convertions. All bugs/ideas reports
  are welcome.
