The »dbview2« package
=====================

This package provides support for dBase files with ACE Basic v2.4 and
consists of the following files:

DBF.doc:       Explanation of the dBase file structure
dbview2.doc:   This file
dbview2.b:     A sample source
dbview2:       A sample program

Overview
--------

Dbview2 reads a dBase random access file and displays its contents on the
screen. All field types (except memos and OLE) are supported. Lotus Approach
.APR files are ignored.

Up to 256 fields with up to 4 KB data each are possible.

Internal
--------

For details, you should read the commented source code.

If you want to develop a dBase conversion utility, you should write the
string d$ to disk. (This is also mentioned in the source code.) You should
refer to your ACE documentation for more information about sequential
files.

The program uses the "dos.library" to be as fast as possible.

Using the package with an ACE 2.0 - 2.3.5
-----------------------------------------

In this case you have to rename the library function names. Perform the
following steps:

(1)  Call a text editor (I suggest to use MEmacs.)

(2)  Load the file "dbview2.b"

(3)  Call the Search/Replace function and replace the following strings:

     Search for:            replace with:

     _Open                  xOpen
     _Close                 xClose
     _Read                  xRead
     _Write                 xWrite

(4)  Save the file and quit the editor.
