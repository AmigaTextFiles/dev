@NODE DosBase

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  *LibraryBase = DosBase()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  This function simply returns the dos.library base pointer for advanced
  programmers. At the end of the program, the dos.library is automatically
  closed (or on a debug end).

@ENDNODE


@NODE ExecBase

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  *LibraryBase.ExecBase = ExecBase()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  This function simply returns the exec.library base pointer for advanced
  programmers. At the end of the program, the exec.library is automatically
  closed (or on a debug end).

@ENDNODE


@NODE GraphicsBase

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  *LibraryBase.GfxBase = GraphicsBase()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  This function simply returns the graphics.library base pointer for advanced
  programmers. At the end of the program, the graphics.library is automatically
  closed (or on a debug end).

@ENDNODE


@NODE IntuitionBase

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  *LibraryBase.IntuitionBase = IntuitionBase()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  This function simply returns the intuition.library base pointer for advanced
  programmers. At the end of the program, the intuition.library is automatically
  closed (or on a debug end).
