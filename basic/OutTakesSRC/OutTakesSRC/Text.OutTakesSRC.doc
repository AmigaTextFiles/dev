 About Out-takes
-----------------

This demo is a thick layer of total stupidity and, as the name suggests,
is supposed to be a collection of all the bad bits that never went into
real demos. Out-takes last for about two minutes ten seconds.
All completely made up by me, with no connection to the real demo makers,
except maybe inspiration (no offence intended).

Oh and if you are some big time computer software
house and want to snap me up because of this amazing
demonstration of my programing prowess (!), sorry but
i am a Java software engineer now and need no job
offers. As if you would ever ask anyway. Ha
