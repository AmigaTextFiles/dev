My Keys System is a copy protection system for Blitz Basic v2.1 programs,
currently in it's 1.3 version, it uses Public keys created by users and
private keys made by authors.

It's really quite simple to use, a public key is made by a user and kept on
their system, when they register a program the file is sent to the
programmer and he can then create a private key which will only work on that
user's system only, and only with that program.

This insures validation of the user by the programmer, and several functions
for the program to use, allowing it to enter demo modes, report pirate
copies and so on.

@endnode
@node req "Requirements"
@{u}Requirements@{uu}

Not many really, just those below:

- OS 3.0 and above.
- Blitz Basic v2.1 (Possibly as well as version below this).
  May also work with other program's, I'll have to experiment a bit first.

The "KeyInclude" program is for checking the private/public keys against
each other (Can go anywhere, but must be in your executable/archive).

The "MakeKey" program is for users to make Public keys (Goes into
distribution archive).

The "Key2" program, makes the private keys to match the public keys.

The first two programs can go anywhere, but the last one @{b}must@{ub} go
into it's own directory (something like "KeysForSysConfig").

@endnode
@node use "Usage"

@{u}KeyInclude@{uu}

The KeyInclude program checks off the private and public keys, and leaves a
wee message for your program in ENV:

The file in the env directory will be named "Report.key" and can contain one
of the three following messages:

Ok       - The Public and Private keys are okay and check off.

Demo     - The user has a Public key, but no private key.

Conflict - There is a conflict/difference between the Public and Private
           keys.

@{u}MakeKey@{uu}

This makes a universal key that can be sent to you/the author for validation
and registration, you then use the "Key2" program to make a private key.

The key is stored in ENVARC: as "Public.Key".

@{u}Key2@{uu}

This is a Shell command that makes the Private key for distribution to
users, it uses the following syntax:

Key2 [public.key]

The program then displays info about the user and asks is it okay, if okay
is selected then the private key is generated in that directory with the
e-mail address of the user as it's title.

@{u}Demo Version@{uu}

As this is only a demo version, anyone can get access to these executables
and make their own Private key for your program. The only way to get a
personalised version for your program is to @{"register" link regis}.

@{u}Richard Hodger - The Author@{uu}

My full name is Richard Hodger, and I'm 17 years old.  I have been using
various types of computers for about 6 years (since I was 11), and have
chosen the Amiga as my favourite, and I live in Northern Ireland.

I have been doing an NVQ in "Installing IT Products" for about 6 months, and
have to admit that it is quite possible the most boring course you could
ever choose.

I started writing programs about 6 months ago, and so far don't think I'm
doing too badly (Comments are appreciated), I started working on the "Keys"
system about 7 days ago (14-2-97) after I heard many complaints from fellow
programmers that there was no copy-protection system as such, and that a PGP
style one would be good.

So far this is the first program to use the "Keys" system, and as soon as it
is finalised it will be realised for use by everyone and anyone.

I'm not going to give out my address here, as I'm none too happy about that,
but I will give the address for my Web pages and e-mail address (No junk
please!!).

@node regis "Registration"
@{u}Regisration@{uu}

Registration is not however free, unfortunatly being a starving student etc
etc (you know the routine) I can't give this away for free, considering that
I have to sit down and recompile the executables evertime someone wants to
register thier program for copy protection blah blah blah....

I'm not asking for much, just 4 of your United Kingdom pounds (UK£4) or the
equivlent, and I'll register your program and send you the executables
either via e-mail or s-mail.

Stick your coins in an envelope, and mail it to: R Hodger

I'm gathering a database of all the programs that use the system, and the
serial numbers are quite big, there's about 6760000000 (Sixty Seven Thousand
and Sixty Million combinations), so don't worry that your program will
clash with another, fill in the registration form below and post it as well.
