				@{b}Introduction@{ub}

	I was working on one of my projects and i thought: "How can i create
	a BB2 shapes file without writing a lot of lines all the times?".
	So i spent some hours to write this simple program. OK, not so good
	its interface, but it is very easy to use and it works fine! 
	It simply load some iff brushes and join them saving the result in
	a BB2 shapes file.

	This program has been developed using BlitzBasic2 by Acid Software.

	See the @{" Usage " link SE_Usage} chapter about its usage.

				@{b}Requirements@{ub}

	@{b}ShapeGen@{ub} requires:

	- OS2.0+
	- reqtools.library by (c) Nico Francois.
	- gadtools.library

	@{b}NOTE:@{ub} this program uses the 'topaz' font. It wasn't tested
	on systems using different fonts for windows and gadget texts!

				@{b}Usage@{ub}

	Not so difficult to use.
	Save your shapes as simple IFF brushes, using the same name and an
	index number (@{b}0 is not allowed!@{ub})

	@{u}Example@{uu}

	MyShape1.iff ;Shape 1 saved as 'MyShape1.iff'
	MyShape2.iff
	....
	MyShapeN.iff

	You can save all your shapes using an extension too but it can be
	the same for all your saved brushes.

	Now, quit from your favourite paint program and run @{b}ShapeGen@{ub}.
	The main window will appear on the WB screen.

	It should appear like this:

	-------------------------------------------------------------
	|	   --------------------------------------  -------  |
	| FileName |					|  | CD  |  |
	|	   --------------------------------------  -------  |
	|          --------------------------------------	    |
	| Min Val. |					|	    |
	|	   --------------------------------------	    |
	|          --------------------------------------	    |
	| Max Val. |					|	    |
	|	   --------------------------------------	    |
	|							    |
        |           ---------------------------------------         |
	| Extension |  					  |	    |
	|           ---------------------------------------         |
	|							    |
	|           ---------------------------------------	    |
	| Output    |					  |         |
	|           ---------------------------------------         |
	|							    |
	|    -----------         -----------          ----------    |
	|    |   OK    |         |  QUIT   |          |  ABOUT |    |
	|    -----------         -----------          ----------    |
	|							    |
	-------------------------------------------------------------


	In the @{b}FileName@{ub} string gadget you have to put the main filename
	for your saved brushes/shapes.

        In the @{b}Min Val.@{ub} string gadget you have to put the min index value
        for your saved brushes/shapes. This is the new feature of this version
        of ShapeGen. Of course, this parameter is optional. If you insert a
        value, shapes will be saved from 0 to maxval-minval. If the minval is
        omitted, well, the default minimum value will be 1. 

	In the @{b}Max Val.@{ub} string gadget you have to put the max index value
	for your saved brushes/shapes.

	@{b}Extension@{ub} is your brushes/shapes used extension.

	@{b}Output@{ub} is the output file name.

	@{b}CD@{ub} can be used to select the directory in which you saved your
	brushes.

	Once you have inserted all necessary values, you can click on the
	@{b}OK@{ub} button.
        All your brushes will be loaded in memory, then joined and saved in
	the output file.

	This is all.

	Now an example.

	@{u}Example@{uu}

	Suppose you have saved four brushes as:

	MyShape1.gfx, MyShape2.gfx, MyShape3.gfx and MyShape4.gfx.

	Now run @{b}ShapeGen@{ub}, click on the CD button and select the
	directory in which you saved your brushes. Now insert these values:

	FileName : MyShape
        Min Val. : 1 ;YOU CAN ALSO OMITTING THIS VALUE...
	Max Val. : 4
	Extension: gfx
	Output	 : RAM:MyShapes.gfx

	Click on the OK button and...voila'...all done!

	On Aminet you can find some works by me:

	@{b}ShowFont@{ub} - (text/font) a simple font viewer working on all Amigas
	@{b}SCrypter@{ub} - (util/crypt) a simple crypter working on all Amigas
	@{b}Bitmania@{ub} - (misc/math) a program to convert numbers (Hex/Bin/Dec)

	Now i'm working on @{b}SeaShell@{ub}, a front-end for @{i}Shelly@{ui} (gfx/3d)
	and i'm developing two games for all Amiga computers.
	More infos about these games will be available as soon as possible.
	A demo version of SeaShell will be uploaded soon...

					@{b}Future@{ub}

	I think this program needs no more features. However, if someone
	has some idea about improving @{b}ShapeGen@{ub}, please try to
	@{" contact me " link SE_Author}.

	I was thinking about a TEST button, so, if it is pressed, a screen
	will appear showing all shapes included in the generated output
	file. Could it be useful? Please, let me know! 8)
