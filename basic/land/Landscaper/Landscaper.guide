   Whats it about?

      Landscaper is a small program which renders a 3D isometric picture of
    a plot of land. The variables associated with this plot of land can be
    altered by using the @{" Options " link opti} from the options window.

      It may not be of much use compared to the likes of Vista but hey -
    WHO CARES.

    When Landscaper was written, I had an old Archimedes program in mind which
    did exactly the same thing as Landscaper. Draw 3D landscapes. I set off
    on a journey of joy and frustration as I struggled to get it coded (in
    BLITZ BASIC ][).

     This program is freeware. It is freely distribuatble, and charges should
    not be more than the media supplied on, but the copyright remains with
    the author. If it is distributed, please include this file with the main
    program. And its not my fault if anything explodes, obviously your
    system with all the extras was too much for your PSU :)

    If any bugs are found, shout abuse at your Amiga and send bug reports
    to my internet address below. If you like this program and you use it
    then e-mail me.

    Landscaper was written by David McMinn.

   Revision History
    1.12 - 07/01/99 - Not previously released, but I need stuff to put on
                      my webpage, so I included a screenmode selector.

    1.11 - 16/10/95 - All features fully working, no bugs, release version

    1.00 - 10/10/95 - Everything works. Palette options not working. Damn.

    0.90 - 08/10/95 - Add palette altering options. How the hell do I do that?

    0.80 - 27/09/95 - Removed 256 colour mode as adds nothing to 32 colours.
                      Used new (!?) GT Gadgets in BB2 that I've just found.

    0.70 - 24/09/95 - 32 colour mode now works.

    0.60 - 23/09/95 - Rendering options now controlled by user instead of
                      changing source code.

    0.55 - 21/09/95 - Basic engine now works. Colour shaded hills, all patches
                      the correct shape.

    0.53 - 20/09/95 - Drawing patches does not work. Source code a complete
                      mess. Decide to re-write entire program.

    0.50 - 17/09/95 - Project initiated. Start to plan and code Landscaper.

      David McMinn is an 21 year old student in Aberdeen doing a PhD in
    AI. More fool him. One can only assume that he wrote this
    'Landscaper' thingy for prestige - it certainly will not make him rich
    or famous. If you wish to send him something, then do so and please send
    some sort of farm animal (for sacrificial purposes >)...

@title "System requirements for Landscaper"

 If you are not sure about any of the terms below, refer to your @{b}@{i}Using
the Amiga@{ub}@{ui} cookery manual.


   @{u}Ingredients :@{uu}

    Amiga        (OS 2.0x+)
    0.5Mb RAM    (at least)
    asl.library  (in libs drawer of boot disk)
    4 Egg whites
    250g Flour


   @{u}Method :@{uu}

    1) Turn on your Amiga and load Workbench as you normally would
    2) Insert the disk with Landscaper on it
    3) Double click on the file Landscaper @{b}-OR-@{ub}
       Type @{i}Landscaper@{ui} at the CLI prompt
    4) Mix egg whites with flour in a bowl and pour paste into bags
    5) Throw bags at PC owners - the anti-matter of society.


   @{u}Installation :@{uu}

    1) Drag all Landscaper files to your hard-drive @{b} -OR-@{ub}
       Copy the files using the CLI

    PROJECT MENU@{ub} :

     Load    - Loads a previously saved Landscaper map file. Select the name
               of the file from the requester that appears.

    Save map - Saves a previously generated map to a file on a disk. Select
               or type the name of the file in the requester that appears. If
               that file already exists, you will be asked if you want to
               overwrite it.

    Save IFF - Saves a previously viewed landscape to a file on a disk. Select
               or type the name of the file in the requester that appears. If
               that file already exists, you will be asked if yuo want to
               overwrite it.

        Info - Displays some info about the program.

        Quit - Exits from the program.

    LANDSCAPE MENU@{ub} :

    @{"Options" link opti} - Gives access to the options window where rendering
               options can be altered.

    Generate - Generates a new map, using the current options settings. If at
               any time you wish to stop the generation process @{i}Stop@{ui}
               button in the main window and the indicator will disappear

               Rendering times vary according to the number fo faults, size
               and faulting method. On an unexpanded A1200, the rendering
               process took 9 mins 05 secs for a 100 fault, size of 160 with
               both methods on. These values are maximums with the exception
               of faults.

                The same options took 52 seconds to render on my 1260@50
               with 32Mb Fastram. He he he.

    Show map - Shows the last map that was calculated. This can be used to

@{b}
  You can change the following parameters in Landscaper, to affect the scene:
@{ub}

    Faults - The number of times the landscape is shifted

      Size - The number of patches long that each side of the landscape is
             Must be between 1 and 160. Larger values of size will need a
             higher resolution screen.

   X Scale - The horizontal scale of the patches

   Y Scale - The into-the-screen scale of the patches

   Z Scale - The vertical scale of the patches

     delta - The amount that any one point in the landscape can change by in
             any one fault.
@{i}
Faulting Method: This is how the program determines which points in the
                 landscape have to be raised or lowered.
@{ui}
  Circular - An imaginary circle is drawn on the landscape and any point
             within this circle is raised or lowered by a random amount up to
             the value of delta.

    Linear - An imaginary line is drawn across the landscape (between two
             points on different sides of the landscape) and any point below
             this line is raised or lowered by a random amount up to the value
             of delta.

Screen Mode- The chosen resolution for displaying the landscape. To keep the
             isometric projection looking 'correct', this table shows the
             relationship bewtween the different scales. These are all
             ratios. A z scale value of 1 always looks good.

  @{b}@{u}Example Screen@{uu}    @{u}X Scale@{uu}    @{u}Y Scale@{uu}@{ub}

   320 x 256        1         0.5
   640 x 256        1         0.25
   320 x 512        1          1
   640 x 512        1         0.5

 You can't actually put decimal values in the gadgets, so for a 320x256 you
would do x scale of 2 and y scale of 1, or bigger if you have a small size.

   Depth - The depth of the screen which will be used to draw the landscape.
             4: One colour sea
                Beach line
                Land shaded according to height
             5: Sea shaded according to depth
                Beach line
                Land shaded according to height
 To set the screenmode and depth, click on the (?) gadget. You will be
presented with a standard system requester for selecting the screenmode and
depth (either 4 or 5 = 16 or 32 colours), and you are only limited by the
screenmodes you have installed in your system.

  Defaults - Sets all parameters to their default values.

      Help - Shows a brief help window

  @{"Palette" link pale} - Brings up the palette requester window

        OK - Accepts the settings in the window and returns to the main window

    CANCEL - Rejects the settings in the window and returns to the main window

  For the best landscape use the following settings:

       Size = 160
    X scale = 2
    Y scale = 1
    Z scale = 1
Screen mode = 640 x 512 or bigger with 32 colours (depth of 5)

    The palette requester really is a marvellous thing. Now you can create
    landscapes in any colour. Note that you must set the screenmode before
    you can use the palette editor (it'll open on the specified screen)
    but if it is smaller than 640x256, then you will need to scroll the
    screen to see all the gadgets - do this by moving the mouse to the
    edges of the screen)

    The buttons...

    Sliders - These alter the RGB components of a colour.

    Palette - You can choose which colour to alter by clicking in one of the
              coloured squares. The chosen colour will appear in the big
              square next to the sliders.

       Load - Allows you to load a standard CMAP palette like the ones saved
              with IFF's or saved in DPaint.

       Save - Allows you to save a standard CMAP palette like the ones saved
              with IFF's or saved in DPaint.

    Default - Resets all the colour values to the defaults.

     Spread - Spreads the currently selected colour to the next colour to be
              selected. To cancel, click on the current colour.

      Exch. - Exchanges the currently selected colour with the next colour
              to be selected. To cancel, click on the current colour.

       Copy - Copies the currently selected colour to the next colour to be
              selected. To cancel, click on the current colour.

         OK - Accepts the colour changes and returns to the @{"Options" link opti} window

     CANCEL - Rejects the colour changes and returns to the @{"Options" link opti} window

    Most errors will cause the program to react positively, i.e. no GURUs.

    If you find a bug which causes an error or even a GURU then mail it to me
    at my internet address (see @{"About" link abou}. The offending error will not be
    dealt with because I can't waste my time with crap programs like this.

    The program may GURU if it is not run after booting from the Workbench
    disk as it may need some other libs and stuff.
