@{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

GTBox Converter is a program which allow you to convert GadToolsBox created
interfaces into BlitzII code.

Its use is very simple and immediate. If you know how GadToolsBox works, then you
can also use GTBox Converter (from now on, simply GTBox). This program was born
as a little personal-use software for convertion and it evolves to what you now
have inside your own hands. A lots of modifies applied to the original software
and a lot will change in future releases (assuming new releases will be done...
;)

Initially, when they implemented gadtools.library into BlitzII, there was no way
to write pretty good interfaces, then I begun playing with GadToolsBox by Jaba
Developement and understood that with a bit of work, I should be able to create a
converter from GadToolsBox to BlitzII. And here it is :)

Main new features:

    *   Completely re-written .... (What a job!! 8)
    *   Now converts ".gui" files, not C files anymore   (Great Power! ;)
    *   Now converts about all tags...
    *   It is 800%/1000% faster than previous versions.
    *   It writes also OS2.00+ replacement BlitzII gadtools commands
    *   Can write USEFULL comments ;)
    *   Completely modular-based...
    *   You can choose what to convert or not...

@{b}HOW TO USE@{ub}

GTBox window is splitted into 4 main parts:

 * A zone where you can select (via @{"CheckBoxes" link "CheckBoxes" 0}) what to convert and what not.

 * Some @{"Integer" link "Integer" 0}-gadgets which will allow you to select the window to use,
   the gadget list to use and the code indent amount.

 * A zone with three @{"gadgets" link "ActionGadgets" 0}: Convert, About and Greetings.

 * A @{" menu " LINK "GTConv_menu"} part.

@{b}GTBOXCONV HISTORY@{ub}

@{fg shine}V4.50@{fg text} - * Added the third menu (for Locator.library)

        * Now user can change constant's Loc name extension

        * Now user can change Loc handler name.

@{fg shine}V4.40@{fg text} - * Added CAT creation (Locator Library)

@{fg shine}V4.30@{fg text} - * Now complete quitvar support

        * Added Locator library support

@{fg shine}V4.21@{fg text} - * Fixed a little bug about the use of correct screen.

        * Fixed GadHandler generation proc

        * Enhanced ScanGadget proc

@{fg shine}V4.20@{fg text} - * Fixed a small bug in Menu Shortcut

        * Added menus

        * Better code generation

        * Now GTSetAttrs is done AFTER window initialization (OS2 Compatible)

        * Better Gadget Handling routines

        * Now gadgets are perfectly rendered

        * Complete New Gadget Handler (Now Called Event Handler)

@{fg shine}V4.11@{fg text} - * OS2 Compatible !!!

        * Now Converts menu.

        * I made a _GREAT_ mistake using GTSetAttrs (which IS OS2 compatible)
          in a very smart move which CRASHES OS2 machines... UPGRADE GUYS! ;)

          - Not very good for a share 8( -

@{fg shine}V4.00@{fg text} - * Completely re-written!!!!

        * Docs in amigaguide !!!

        * Smart parsing routine (ex. detects PUBLIC or CUSTOM screen selection)

        * Converts about ALL tags (even some not supported by GadToolsBox!!)

        * It is 800% / 1000% faster than V3.04 Beta version!!!

        * Writes EVERYTHING! After converting you can load up the BB2 file
          and see it working perfectly and without nothing more to do!
          (OK, you have to write the program... ;)

        * It is so modular you will find yoursel sectionated!!!

        * Converts ".gui" not C files anymore!!!!


@{fg shine}V3.04@{fg text} - (BETA VERSION!!!) Improved line input routine. Now it is 800% faster on
        an A4000/040 and about 1600% faster on an A1200/020 !!!!

        Improved parsing routine about 300% faster.

        Reduced code getting rid of Elmore dos library (at last!)

        NOTE: this is a beta version. Use it at your own risk!

@{fg shine}V3.03@{fg text} - Improved GadTools  List generation process.  Now the program calculates
        offy  (system  fonts height offset) BEFORE opening the window.  In this
        way it has not to do a window resize (loosing a lot of time drawing the
        gadgets again).
        This method incredibly speeds up window opening.

@{fg shine}V3.02@{fg text} - Corrected a BUG inside MENU code generation.  It is funny to notice how
        this code's NEVER been modified in previous versions.
        During code generation, the program code did a strange "line feed".
        The "funny" part of all this is that this BUG was not mine, but
        BlitzII's  :) !! Infact try writing a code like this:

        Function.s MegaBug{a$}
            Function Return a$
        End Function

        NPrint MegaBug{"123456"}+"7890"

        MouseWait
        End

        And you'll see a very fine result!
        Pratically BlitzII write "123456789" and lose the "0" !!!! :(
        ACID SOFTWARE DO ANYTHING!!!!

        (NW: First note of this bug was given me by Michele Puccini from
        ClassX. I never corrected GTBoxConv before, simply because I didn't
        think I had written a line of code similar to the one in the example.
        For what concerns malfunction of GTBoxConv, I have to thank Stefano
        Clemente.)
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------

        Added an Icon to GtBoxConv. It is UGLY... but better than nothing!

        Added English Documentation.

@{fg shine}V3.01@{fg text} - Corrected a minor bug in GTNumber creation: it wrote "True" instead of
        "0". Now it is OK.

@{fg shine}V3.00@{fg text} - Release Version.

@{b}FUTURE@{ub}

Due to the modular structure of my GTBox Converter, now I can easily add/remove
features. So I can assure you @{fg shine}GTBox will have everything I'll think could be
useful implemented@{fg text} sooner or later.

Next version will have, for example, @{fg shine}Menu convertion option@{fg text}.

I am also planning a version which will be able to write source code for
different languages.

@{b}PLEASE NOTE:@{ub} future version of GTBox Conv will be shipped only to @{i}REGISTERED@{ui}
users! GTBox Conv from now on is a@{b} SHAREWARE@{ub} product, as stated inside the

@node "CheckBoxes" "CheckBoxes"
@{b}CHECK BOXES OPTIONS@{ub}

By checking or not a specific checkbox, you will choose what steps will be done
in convertion process. Possible CheckBoxes actually are:

@{fg shine}Convert Screen@{fg text}:  Check this if you want GTBox to convert screen.

@{fg shine}Convert Gads@{fg text}:    Check this if you want GTBox to convert gadgets.

@{fg shine}Convert Bevels@{fg text}:  Check this if you want GTBox to convert Bevel Boxes.

@{fg shine}Convert Texts@{fg text}:   Check this if you want GTBox to convert Texts.

@{fg shine}Convert Window@{fg text}:  Check this if you want GTBox to convert the window.

@{fg shine}Convert Menus@{fg text}:  Check this if you want GTBox to convert the menus.

@{fg shine}Add Gad Handler@{fg text}: Check this if you want GTBox to add a gadget handler.

                @{b}@{fg shadow} NOTE:@{ub}@{fg text} Added gad handler may change whether you tick
                       "Convert Gads" or not!

@{fg shine}OS2.0 Comp Comds@{fg text}: Check this if you want GTBox to add some OS2.0+ compatible
                  code inside your program. This is usefull if you are 
                  planning to create a program OS2.0+ compatible.

@{fg shine}Add Comments@{fg text}:    Check this gadget if you want GTBox to add comments

@{fg shine}Smart Settings@{fg text}:  At the moment this checkbox does just one thing, but it may
                 change in future.

@{fg shine}Suppress Warnings@{fg text}: Checking this, you prevent GTBox to show a warning window 
                   any time something is not "just" OK...
                   For example, if you do not set a specific (needful) value
                   for a gadget, usually GTBox shows a warn telling you 
                   what's wrong and what it will do... If you believe in
                   GTBox, just suppress warning! ;)

@{fg shine}Create Report File@{fg text}: Currently it is not implemented.

                You will be asked by a file requester to select the 
                source ".gui" file to convert.

                Then you will be asked to insert the destination file name.

Locator.library is a lib written by me which allows program's localization
also under OS2.0, and it is fully compatible with OS3.0+

It is extremely easy to use, so I encourage you to have a look, and then,
after all, GTBox Conv supports it... so why don't you?

Have a look, you can find it on AmiNet under "util/libs" directory, 
and it is called "Locator.lha"

Otherwise, e-mail me: I'll send you the lib UUEncoded ;)
