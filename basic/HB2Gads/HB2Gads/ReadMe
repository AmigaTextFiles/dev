This program was written using an A2000 and requires an OS2+. It is
FREEWARE and can be freely copied and distributed as long as no monetary
gain is involved. It is also provided 'as is' without any express or
implied guaranty.

The program appears to be free of bugs... but if you experience any,
please let me know; also, if you make any significant improvement of the
code.

Credits and thanks are given to Nico Francois for LacePointer, and to
Stieve Tibbet for the code of the Spinning Clock, which are both used in
this program.

My original intent was to attach GadTools Gadgets to GimmeZeroZero/
Borderless Windows, opened with the HBasic2 WINDOW Command as in
GADS.bas. My goal, though, fell quite short, because I was unable for
example to implement properly a ListView Gadget when it was the
sole or very first gadget in the gadget list (see the ABOUT SUB). I had
the same problem with Mutually Exclusive and Scroller Gadgets. Another
problem I met was a failure of the ListView and Scroller gadgets to
respond to continous activation of their arrows with the pointer.
Feeling that there must be proper ways to achieve all these features, I
tried hard to solve the problems, but did not succeed. I would therefore
like very much, and appreciate it, to hear from anyone who knows the
solutions, others than those I resorted to, or were the problems reside.

I met no difficulty to implement properly, apparently at least, all the
gadgets by including their list in the structure of a Window before
opening it, as shown in WGADS.bas. I cosider this, however, to be a
defeat of my original purpose and goal.
