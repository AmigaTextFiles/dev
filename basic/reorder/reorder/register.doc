Hiya, this is a standard registration document for nearly all software
written by me.  It is quite simple really.  Nearly all of my programs are
released as un-crippled shareware, but with a 'please register' feature 
for regular users.  (sorry..)

Registering is simple.  Just send me money ;-)  The recommended ammount is
£10 in UK currency, unless otherwise specified.  I cannot accept stuff in
wierd foreign currencies, it takes ages to convert, and costs ME money.

Some of my programs are released as freeware, but I would appreciate an
email or a postcard letting me know that the effort wasn't wasted competely.

You will also need to send me the file 'S:Braneloc.key' which is required
for all my programs to run.  The preferred method of sending it to you is as
an uuencoded file across the internet.  If you insist, you may send a floppy
disk containing the file.  In fact, this is probably easier than sending 
one physical post, and one electronic, but that's your choice.  If you want
the file-on-disk and returned, please specify this very clearly.  I'd MUCH
rather return keyfiles over the net.

Either way, when I have received the registration I will return the file 
(updated) with your unrestricted access codes, and stamped with your name
and address.

If you wish to register multiple programs, not a problem.  Contact me for
special rates.

Remember to include your name and address, and the name of the program you
are registering.  This will be available as a version string.

	version <program_name>

Your updated keyfile will be good for any future versions of the program,
which will be available in the usual places.  Software will first be
made available at my website address, or released to DraughtFlow BBS,
and uploaded to the aminet later.  I may set up a mailing list for update
information if you request it.  Go on..

Please support shareware.  Remember, it is much better receiving 100% of £10
than 5% of £30-£40(or more) for commercial releases.  Please support
shareware. Having people using your software is great, but receiving money
for it is better, and is likely to inspire more releases, more often.
Please support Amiga shareware.
