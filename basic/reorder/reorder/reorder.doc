Ok.  Whats all this about sorting programs ?

Simply, if you have all your procedures/functions/sub's all in jumbled up,
it can be really, really hard to find the one you are looking for. 

Solution: Put them in alphabetical order.

How ?: Run this program.

Usage: runraw <filename>

Installation: bung it somewhere interesting.  C: probably.
