Just a short appendix to the manuel (not for interest except you
are using AIDE).

 But first: This whole Readme file has been put into that archive
            by me (Daniel Seifert) so don't blame Manuel if there
            is something wrong with it,  but direct all flames to
            d.seifert@monos.insider.org or just forget it ;-)


 I don't recommend to use AceImage.lib with AIDE by selecting it
 from the modules listview. There are two other ways to do this
 in a better way:

  (1) Type "acelib:AceImage.lib" in the text gadget that appears
      after you selected "Other Linker Options".
  (2) Make use of the LinkAEP script (actually written for AEP,
      but will be installed by this script automatically if it
      doesn't exist yet) and modify the line with your linker
      to support AceImage, by putting an "ACElib:AceImage.lib"
      before "{rest}" !

 I recommend (1), it's easier.
