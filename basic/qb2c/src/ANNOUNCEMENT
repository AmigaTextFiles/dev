 PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT                                     12.Jan 1999.

 HOW TO OBTAIN QB2C, COPYRIGHT NOTICE

 The QB2C BASIC for UNIX comes in two versions: a FREEWARE (evaluation-ware)
 and a PAYWARE vesrion. The latest FREE version, qb2c-3.40.tgz can be found
 at the usual place: ftp://darkstar.irb.hr/pub/qb2c/
 This version is made available for evaluation purpose.

 Please visit http://faust.irb.hr/~stipy/qb2c/qb2c.html for more
 updated information on both Free and Commercial versions of QB2C.

 Current pay version 4.15 is available NOW as of 17.Nov 1999. It includes
 many improvements and additional features over the free version.  
 Backwards compatibility with code written for older (free) versios of 
 QB2C is fully kept, however many new things are added:

 o Arays can now be declared dinamically, thus allowing arrays to be
   dimensioned during the program execution, resized and erased.
   Newly added comands to this end are: DIM [DYNAMIC], REDIM and ERASE;

 o Newly added graphic commands: XTRAN, XROT, XSCAL, MRESET, XCLOSEDS
   make possible easy manipulation of graphis output without changing
   a single line of existing code;

 o Allow use of window buffer(s) for smoother animation (XBUF, XRMBUF);

 o Newly added other commands: LCASE$, UCASE$, ENVIRON$, DATA, READ, RESTORE,
   HEX$, OCT$, DEFSTR and more;

 o More flexible syntax of inline IF commands and support for ELSEIF;

 o GET, PUT SEEK binary I/O file commands;

 o OUT, INP parellel port I/O commands (Linux/ IBM-PC only);

 o More detailed documentation (manual);

 o Most important X-fonts used with XTEXT command now have predefined names,
   so that programmer do not have any more to know the full name of a
   particular font. It is enough to specify a generic font name and size; 

 o More programming examples, especially for new graphics capabilities;

 o Removed bugs and misfeatures.

 For the last point, I thank to numerous people around the world who 
 have kindly sent me their bug reports and suggestions.
 
 The price of the ever newest version of QB2C is 35 US$ or equivalent

 README

 QB2C a BASIC to C translator                              Date: Sep 21 1998

 Thank you for obtaining this version of QB2C. You can find the latest
 FREE version of QB2C on this place:
 ftp://darkstar.irb.hr/pub/qb2c/qb2c.tgz

 QB2C translates BASIC programs into ANSI-C programs. Includes X11-based
 graphics. It has been tested under Linux, OSF1 (DEC), Sun-OS (Solaris),
 Aix (IBM), SGI (Silicon Graphics) and HP-UX (hp).
 Under HP-UX screen dependent things like 'INKEY$' would not work (termios.h),
 for other the full functionality is obtained.
 
 The whole package is in the file qb2c.tgz. To install it, place
 the file in an empty directory and type: tar zxvf qb2c.tgz
 (if this doesn't work try in two steps: gunzip qb2c.tgz; tar xvf qb2c.tar).
 To build executables "qb2c", "bcpp", "calib", "bhelp" and scripts "bcc", 
 "brun" and "run" under given OS just type the name of the corresponding 
 script:

   Operating System |  script to build executables
   -----------------+-----------------------------
   Linux            |  doall
   DEC-OSF          |  doall_osf
   Sun-OS           |  doall_sun
   IBM-Aix          |  doall_aix
   Silicon Graphics |  doall_sgi
   HP-UX            |  doall_hp

 Executables and scripts should be put somewhere where you
 keep your executables, for instance in ~/bin or /usr/local/bin, or
 the directory where you compiled the QB2C should be put in the search path.

 Details of operation of the package can be found in the document manual.txt,
 which can be wieved typing the command "bhelp".
 A keyword can be specified as a parameter to this command in order to
 get specific help: "bhelp keyword".
