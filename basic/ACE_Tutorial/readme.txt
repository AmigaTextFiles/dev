This is a preliminary release of my tutorial for the ACE BASIC compiler.  It was originaly designed to work with AIDE 1.1, but that does not currently work on all OS4.1 machines.  I hope to in a future release fix that so it will work on all machines, but until that time you should be able to use 'bas.phx' in the bin dir to compile the BASIC source files.

Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to build an installer, but you should be able to just copy over any of the included files that you don't have into your current ACE installation.

If you have any questions or run into any probelms or bugs with this tutorial, please contact me at vmarti@xmission.com.
