This is a very large and unfortunately unfinished paint program done 
in BlitzBasic2. 

The source is included and for educational purposes only.
You may study it. It is not allowed to use the source codes (in full
or in parts) in other programs without my permisson. But you can
ask me :)  And if you want to continue the development of this
project then mail me. 

None of the files of this package may be modified or left without
permission from me. Crunching or archiving is allowed only if none
of the files get modified by it.

DeltaPaint is not a finished product. It has some bugs etc. Because
that I'm not responsible for any loss of data, damages to software
or hardware that may result directly or indirectly from the use of
this program. I'm reserves the right to make changes to the software
or documentation (hehe! :) without notice.
