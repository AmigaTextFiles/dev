;This is just a quick prog to rinally clear up the bitmapbitplanes queries
;move the mouse around to move the circle, and you'll see the effect working

; the only problem I had was figuring out that the dark half of the palette
;needs to be the last bitplane, but common sense should have told me that!
; note that if you make the first 5 bitplanes dark and  then have the last
;bitplane lighter, yu can create torch effects like in onEscapee. :)

; only 64 colours, because scenegenerator that I used for the quick piccy is
; 32cols only which is a shame. The brush used is a 1 bitplane object
