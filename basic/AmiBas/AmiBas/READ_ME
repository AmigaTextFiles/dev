LIST
' These AmigaBASIC programs are distributed
' in Germany as part of the official Extras
' disk (here called ExtrasD), but there with
' german comments.

' Programs are Copyright Dr. Peter Kittel,
' Commodore Frankfurt, Germany, and may
' be distributed freely.
' There is only one exception:
' the 3d-nplot program came from an 
' HP User Group, see copyright note there.

' The programs, short descriptions:

' 3d-nplot
' Provides a hidden line algorithm to draw
' a 3d view of a function Z(X,Y) you have
' to provide as a subroutine. 
' See the built-in example.
' Algorithm is UNKNOWN, perhaps anyone
' out there can teach us, we feel
' deeply ashamed for this situation.
' Variable names have no meaning in general,
' most of them were generated automatically
' in a conversion process from an earlier
' version. It ran on real PETs then!
' Note definition of the function as a
' subroutine, so we are able to use IF!
' Greatest advantage:
' It takes 5 minutes maximum to adapt this
' program to any computer or plotter known,
' as long as it runs Microsoft BASIC.

' Caleidoscope
' With this you get a faint imitation
' of the Electronic Arts Caleidoscope.

' CLogo
' Want to learn about PAINT and AREA?
' Look at this totally neutral example,
' not disturbing fun by permanently
' inserted ads, just showing some cute,
' colored patterns...

' Comp
' Utility: Compare two files byte by byte.
' You may choose to look at the file
' contents (in hex) with differences
' marked by color.
' Learn about byte oriented file I/O,
' making a hexdump, interact with user.

' lib2
' Slighty modified version of the
' old program Library from the Extras
' disk. Now diskfont is used to choose
' a font really from the disk, so you
' can use ANY.

' Search
' AmigaBASIC version with following 
' differences to the AmigaDOS one:
' the search string may contain control
' chars, a binary file can be searched,
' contents around an occurence of the
' search string is shown as hexdump.
' Same features used as in Comp.
