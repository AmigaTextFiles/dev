Hello, several night ago I was wonderer about 
random numbers.
I know that a good programming language must have
some random command inside, otherwise it is a GUI
creator, IMHO.
I have found my only answer on IL MIO
COMPUTER, an italian collection of books devoted
to retro computer I partially have! ;-)
On the first book there was an explanation about
what are random number and it was explained how
they can be generated! :-D
The routine inside this program is my first poor try to
make a random number generator. :-)
I have noticed that the first version of this program
never generate the zero (0) result; now I should have
solved the problem.
It has been made by Blitz Basic 2.1. :-)
Try it and let me know! ;-)
Am I on the right way? ;-)
The source code is almost in italian, sorry! :-(

Ciao!
