@node "Copyright" "Commands"

   NOTE: Commands doc`s were written by the author of the library.
         The only thing to say is, that all commands should
         be usable in Amiga/Blitz mode. If you aren`t sure how to
         work with the commands, have a look at the example.
 

   SYNTAX: p61_Inquire_ (void)

   Get a pointer to the replayer's status block. This block is mostly
   read-only; you CAN write to the volume, tempo and play fields, and
   the replayer will react to your changes. The other fields should
   generally only be read from.



   SYNTAX: p61_Play_ (module,sampledata,samplebuffer)

   Initialize the replayer and start playing the given module.
   Unpack samples into the given samplebuffer if necessary.

   module       - pointer to a P61 module.
   sampledata   - pointer to the module's samples, or NULL if the
                  samples follow the module.
   samplebuffer - pointer to a buffer into which the sample data should
                  be unpacked into, or NULL if the samples are not
                  packed. Make sure the buffer is large enough to hold
                  the unpacked data!

   error - if the replayer started successfully, this will be NULL.
           If for whatever reason the replayer failed to start, this
           will be non-NULL.

   Make sure the final sample buffer is in CHIP RAM! If the samples
   follow the module, the module buffer should be in CHIP RAM; if the
   samples come in their own buffer, that buffer should be in CHIP RAM;
   if they are packed, the buffer to unpack into should be in CHIP RAM.



   SYNTAX: p61_SetPos_ (position)

   Jumps to the specified position in the module, if the replayer is
   running.

   Don't call this if p61_Play_ didn't succeed, or if you never called
   p61_Play_!



   SYNTAX: p61_SetVol_ (volume)

   Set the master volume (the volume field in the p61status structure)
   to the given value. This is safe to call whether or not the replayer
   is actually running.



   SYNTAX: p61_Stop_

   If the replayer was started successfully with pl61_Play(), this
   function turns the replayer off and deallocates all resources.

   Don't call this if pl61_Play_ didn't succeed, or if you never called
   pl61_Play_!

@node "install" "Installation"

  Sorry, but I was too lazy to add an Installer script, but I
  think programmers can do this for theirselves. It`s not
  too hard...

  1) Copy file player61.library1 to BlitzLibs:AmigaLibs/
  2) Run a texteditor and modify file BlitzLibs:LibNums.bb
  3) Insert line after AMIGALIBS: #player61=197
  4) Remake your DEFLIBS file
  5) Exit & run Blitz2 again

  Now just have a try and type in P61_Play_ or another command.
  Now it should be printed in another colour. If not, you`ve
  probably done something wrong!?

  The library number is 197. If this place is filled in your libnums.bb,
  then you can ask me to create it for another number or do this yourself.

@node "wasmacht" "A"
 
   This is a Blitz port for player61.library by Petter E. Stokke. With
   this library you`re able to play Player61 modules (packed Protracker
   Modules). 

   Player61 by Jaarno Parnaanen is the most effective MOD cruncher ever
   released. You can get the full Player61 distribution from Aminet.
   A Protracker>Player61 module converter is included in this package.
   Just try it! You`ll be surprised!

@node "System" "Requirements"

  Hardware:

  - an Amiga

  Software:

  - Blitz Basic II
  - player61.library
  - Player61 distribution from Aminet

@node "cardware" "How to use"

  One example is delivered with. It plays a P61 Mod. Have a look
  at it, because it`s not as easy as loading a Protracker module.
