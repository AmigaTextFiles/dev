@NODE INTRO "Introduction"

   @{b}Introduction :@{ub}

   PureBasic is a new "high level" programming language based on established 
   "BASIC" rules. It is compatible with any other "BASIC" compiler, whether its
   for the Amiga or PC format. Learning PureBasic is very easy! PureBasic has been 
   created for beginner and expert alike. Compilation time is really fast.

   This software has been developed for the Amiga with the Amiga environment
   in mind. We have put a lot of effort into its realization to produce a fast,
   reliable and system friendly language. The respect of the OS is always the
   watchword. You cannot write bad software with the basic command set provided.
   Of course, you can also add new functions to bash the hardware and utilise
   the Amiga's full potential if you need to.

   The syntax is easy and the possibilities are huge with the "advanced" functions 
   that have been added to this language like pointers, structures, procedures, 
   dynamically linked lists and much more. For the experienced coder there are
   no problems gaining access to any of the legal OS structures or Amiga objects.

   PureBasic supports the 680x0 processor and, very shortly, PowerPC. The PowerPC 
   processor option is not yet fully implemented but it is hoped that this will
   be fully supported after further necessary testing.
   The 68000 option has been optimized to create the best code possible, however 
   we are sure we can do even better! We will keep trying!


   The main features of PureBasic:

     - 68000 and 68020+ support (PowerPC support in progress).
     - Built-in arrays, dynamically linked lists, complex structures, pointers
       and variable definitions.
     - Supported types: Byte (8 bits), Word (16 bits), Long (32 bits) and also user
       defined (structures).
     - Signed and unsigned support for standard types.
     - Built-in string types.
     - Constants, binary and hexadecimal numbers supported.
     - Expression reducer by grouping constants and numeric numbers together.
     - Standard arithmetic support in respect of sign priority and parenthesis:
       +, -, /, *, and, or, lsl, asl, lsr, asr.
     - Compile 30,000 lines/min using a 68030/50 (with PoolMem installed).
     - Procedure support for structured programming with local and global 
       variables (work still in progress).
     - All Standard BASIC keywords: If-Else-EndIf, Repeat-Until, etc.
     - External library support to manipulate objects like IFF pictures,
       screens, windows, gadgets, etc.
     - AmigaOS libraries fully supported as if they were BASIC keywords
     - Assembler Inline
     - Precompiled structures with constants files for extra fast compilation.
     - Debugger to stop programme execution and trace bugs easily.
     - Configurable CLI compiler.
     - System friendly, easy to install and always under development.

@NODE HISTORY "PureBasic History"

  @{b}V1.40 (14.03.2000):@{ub}

  About the compiler:
    * It's now allowed to include any 680x0 asm keywords in a BASIC code.
    * Added 'Unions' support in 'Structures'
    * Updated and revised resident files (Small_AmigaOS)
    * Some bugs removed.

  About the PureLibraries:
    * 4 brand new PureLibraries have been added:
      - AmigaSprite
      - Joypad
      - Sprite
      - Timer
    * 5 new commands added in existing PureLibraries:
      - Requester: EasyRequester()
      - BitMap   : ShowBackBitMap()
      - Screen   : CreateDualPlayfield(), RemoveDualPlayField()
      - Palette  : LoadPalette()
    * Some changes:
      - ShowBitmap() is now faster and doesn't perform anymore a VWait() automatically.
      - 'Stop' has been renamed to 'CallDebugger'
      - The bitmaps are now opened in 'Interleaved' mode. All the functions has been
        rewritten to support this new and faster feature.
    * Some bugs has been removed in the 'Sound' library.

  About the editor:
    * Added the cut/copy/paste feature
    * Automatic indent
    * A requester has been added when saving a source code on a file which already exists.
    * All the documentation has been updated in the 3 langages !
    * Some memory problems have been resolved.


  @{b}V1.30 (24.01.2000):@{ub}

  About the compiler:
    * Even more smaller and optimized compiled executables!
    * Compare operands can be reversed (<= or =< and >= or =>).
    * Any bad keyword on the line is now signalled.
    * PowerPC executables output works really (See PPC_Example drawer).
    * Many useless PowerPC libraries have been removed (faster compilation).
    * Possibility to use Ascii constants: "value = 'A'" is like "value = 65".
    * Procedure support is now finished. It includes strings as parameters and can
      return a value.
    * Possibility to omit the '=' statement: "a+1" is like "a=a+1". Works for
      any type of expression on any types.
    * AmigaOS support completed (All Rom3.1 Includes converted and functions calls
      under PureBasic are perfect).
    * Faster compilation due to a nearly complete rewrite of the compiler engine.
    * Much faster include file routine.
    * Reduced memory consumption and no need for PoolMem anymore.
    * Many little bugs fixes (like always).

  About the PureLibraries:
    * Added a brand new chunky library with very fast chunky2planar routine.
    * Optimized and bug fixed the linkedlist library.
    * New commands: FindString(), ChangeCurrentElement().
    * Bug fixed commands: Mid(), StripLead(), InitScreen(), InitTagList(), BusyPointer()
      and ActivateGadget().
    * Changed commands name: DPrint() -> PrintText().
    * Updated the docs.

  About the Editor:
    * Boopsi (ie: realtime) slider bars added.
    * 'NoCli Output' option added.
    * Preferences for each file can now be saved.
    * Some bugs fixed.


  @{b}V1.20 (30.11.1999):@{ub}

    * The integrated editor is now finished !
    * You can use any AmigaOS external library directy in your source, as
      it was PureBasic command ! There is no limits. You can add your
      libraries very easely with a GUI based convertor.
    * Added 3 new libraries: Amiga, Sound & Sort. Read the help for more infos.
    * Added many new functions:
        - LinkedList: ClearList(), PreviousElement(), InsertElement()
        - File      : MakeDirectory(), RenameFile(), DeleteFile()
                      WriteStringN()
        - Window    : ChangeIDCMP(), BevelBox()
        - String    : Mid(), Val(), FindString(),StripTrail(), StripHead()
        - Misc      : PrintNumberN(), Peek(), Poke()
    * Warning ! 3 Functions has been changed for better logic:
        NPrint()    -> PrintN()
        PrintNum()  -> PrintNumber()
        WriteString -> Doesn't write a end of line caracter anymore.
                       Please use WriteStringN() to do it.
    * Changed: to get a label address, use '?' instead of '@'
    * The Debugger has been updated and bug fixed. Much better now.
    * Updated the doc file to build your own custom PureLibraries. Easier :).
    * Optimized several functions in size/speed.
    * Many bugs fixes.


  @{b}V1.10 (27.10.1999):@{ub}

    * Added 3 PureBasic libraries: Commodity, ToolType and String.
    * Much faster source file loading.
    * Full German and French support (Help file and reference manual).
    * Fixed lot of bugs (like always).
    * PPC support continued but still not finished.
    * GoldED plugin to highlight PureBasic keywords and specific datas by Julian Kinraid.
    * Dedicated editor is now under construction (50% finished).
    * Much better archive layout, with a cool installer script.
    * And more.


  @{b}V1.02 (12.09.1999):@{ub}

    * Forget to include 2 files for the PPC compilation. Now it should work :).
    * Fixed some bugs.
    * Added the Reference.guide completely revised by LES. Again, big thanks.


  @{b}V1.01 (05.09.1999):@{ub}

    * Create real PowerPC WarpOS executable. PowerPC support still in progress.
    * Added the main guide (this guide !) revised by LES. Thank you !


  @{b}V1.00 (01.09.1999):@{ub}

    * First major release.
