  @{b}PureBasic Picture library V1.00@{ub}

    Pictures handled by PureBasic are stored in the IFF-ILBM format,
    the Amiga's standard picture format. Both compressed and uncompressed
    pictures are supported. The read/decompression routines have been
    highly optimized and even big pictures load in less than a second
    on any Amiga. Enjoy!

@NODE FreePicture

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  FreePicture(#Picture)

    @{b}STATEMENT@{ub}
  Removes the given Picture from memory.

@ENDNODE


@NODE InitPicture

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  result.l = InitPicture(#NumPictureMax)

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  Init all the Picture environments for later use. You must put this
  function at the top of your source code if you want to use the Picture
  commands. 

  #NumPictureMax : Maximum number of Pictures to handle.

@ENDNODE


@NODE LoadPicture

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  PictureID.l = LoadPicture(#Picture, FileName$)

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  LoadPicture() will attempt to load an IFF-ILBM picture into
  memory. If FAST RAM is available then the picture will be stored
  there. The picture will be kept in compressed form (if it is
  already a compressed IFF-ILBM file) to save memory.

  The result from LoadPicture() can return 3 error values:

    If PictureID = -1: File is not found
    If PictureID = -2: File is not an IFF-ILBM picture
    If PictureID = -3: Not enough free memory to load the picture

    If PictureID >= 0: Picture was loaded successfully
@ENDNODE


@NODE UsePicture

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  UsePicture(#Picture)

    @{b}STATEMENT@{ub}
  Changes the currently used picture to given #Picture.

@ENDNODE


@NODE PictureToBitMap

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  Result.l = PictureToBitMap(#Picture, BitMapID)

    @{b}COMMAND@{ub}
  Copies the given IFF-ILBM picture data to the given bitmap. Note, this
  function is very optimized. It supports compressed and uncompressed
  IFF pictures.

    The result from PictureToBitmap can return 2 error values:

      If Result = -1: BitmapHeader or Body chunk aren't found (ie: IFF
                      palette only)
      If Result = -2: Picture size is too big for the bitmap.

@ENDNODE


@NODE PictureWidth

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  Width.w = PictureWidth()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  Returns the current picture's width.

@ENDNODE


@NODE PictureHeight

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  Height.w = PictureHeight()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  Returns the current picture's height.

@ENDNODE


@NODE PictureDepth

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  Depth.b = PictureDepth()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  Returns the current picture's depth.

@ENDNODE


@NODE PictureID

    @{b}SYNTAX@{ub}
  *PictureAddr.l = PictureID()

    @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}
  Returns the current picture's memory location. It points to the start
  of the IFF file ('FORM' chunk).

@ENDNODE
