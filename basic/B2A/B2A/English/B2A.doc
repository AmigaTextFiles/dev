                           B2A
                           ===

1. Warranties
-------------
I can't take warranty about the function and the development
of the program.


2. Description
--------------
With B2A you can convert binary or protected saved Amiga-
BASIC files into ASCII files.
This program is first of all written for the Amiga 1200,
which has problems with AmigaBASIC. So now you can convert
the programs you've written and edit them or translate
them to another language/dialect.

3. Getting started
------------------
B2A is started as usual by entering the name in the Shell
or by simply double-clicking the icon on the workbench.

4. Operation
------------
Simply press "Load binary..." to load a binary or protected
BASIC file and "Save ASCII..." to save it back or press
l/L to load and s/S to save!


5. History
----------
Version 1.0 (7/13/93):
Should have worked great (at least at my A1200 with OS3.0)

Version 1.01 (7/16/94):
One bugs has been removed (converting real numbers).

Version 1.02 (9/30/94):

6. The future
-------------
I think I won't do anything more for this program since it's
quite perfect. Perhaps if enough people wish, I could localize
it.

I really would be happy if some people would write to me, since
it cost me some (spare) time to write the proggy. I would be
glad if someone would send me a present (CDs, phone cards,
stamps...)!
