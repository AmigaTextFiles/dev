  You use MethodBBLib at your own risk! The @{"author" link Author} accepts no
responsability for any damage caused to the user, his hardware or his software. 

  This is FREEware!!! You can use and distribute it as long as you don't
modify the distribution and you don't earn money with it.

  If you use this lib in your program, please put my name somewhere in the doc
and in the program itself. Your program MUST be freeware. Thank you!

  If you want to give me something in order to reward me, DO IT ;^)

  If you want to program MUI applications or applications using DataTypes with
Blitz Basic 2, you will see that a command misses : DoMethod! For the
DataTypes, DoGadgetMethodA from intuition.library is usable, but it is not
easy to use because you have to use the tags. For MUI, DoGadgetMethodA is
unusable. So the DoMethod command from amiga.lib is indispensable! Besides,
you can use it without using a tags structure or something like that, you can
use it like in C! The function DoMethodA is also present for compatibility.
  You can now use BOOPSI gadgets, MUI, and DataTypes in your Blitz 2 programs!
You are given two examples in order to show you how to use the command DoMethod
with DT and MUI.
  I added DoSuperMethod, DoSuperMerhodA, CoerceMethod, CoerceMethodA and
SetSuperAttrs functions in order to allow users to make OOP (Objects Oriented
Programming).

  - An Amiga, of course!
  - Blitz Basic 2 (Any version)
  
  If you want to you use DataTypes, you will need the kickstart 3.0+.
  
  In order to program MUI apps, please download the archive mui38dev-bb2 in
dev/mui directory on Aminet.
  
  That's all! Even an Amiga 1000 can use MethodBBLib!

@{b}Installation@{ub}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

@{i}- Run Blitz Basic 2
- PROJECT->LOAD (OR Right Amiga + L)
- Load the file "Userlibs/MethodBBLib.asc"
- Replace the "xx" by a free lib number (see further)
- COMPILER->OPTIONS (OR Amiga Right + O)
- Active only "Make Smallest Code"
- Active "Resident" and type blitzlibs:libmacs.res
- Click on OK
- PROJECT->SAVE (OR Right Amiga + S)
- Save it as "MethodBBLib.bb2" for example .
- COMPILER->CREATE FILE (OR Amiga Right + E)
- Select "Blitzlibs:Userlibs/MethodBBLib.obj"
- Click on OK
- ReMake your deflibs and relaunch the blitz@{ui}

  That's it! You made it! Now type "domethod" and press the "Help" key. The
word "DoMethod" must appear, else email me.
  For the free lib number, look at the file "libnums" if you have it and if
you update it frequently, else try a number between 0 and 40.

  If you have SuperTed from RWE, you can install the special guide. Just copy
the file "MethodBBLibd.guide" to "Blitz2:REDHelp/AcidGuides/". Then edit the 
file "Blitz2:REDHelp/RedHelp.dat" with any editor (e.g. ed) and add the line :
00XX Blitz2:REDHelp/AcidGuides/MethodBBLibd.guide
Replacing XX with the lib number you chose.
