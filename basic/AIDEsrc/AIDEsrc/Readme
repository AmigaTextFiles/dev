Short:    v2.13, ACE IDE (source)
Uploader: dseifert@berlin.sireco.net (Daniel Seifert)
Author:   dseifert@gmx.de (Daniel Seifert)
Type:     dev/basic
Version:  2.13 (08-17-1997) (01-19-1999)

This is the source code of AIDE (ACE Integrated Development Environment).
For further information about what AIDE is, read the supplied manual that
should be found as AIDE.html in AIDEsrc/latest (for AIDE version 2.13) or
as AIDE.guide in AIDEsrc/2.12 (for AIDE version 2.12).  Please do not ask
where the AmigaGuide manual for 2.13 is,  I have no clue where I left it.
But you could download the compiled binary from aminet where this file is
definitely in ;)

Okay, what's this all about with this source stuff?  Some notes why I re-
lease the source and some comments on things you should take care of!

The last version of AIDE (= 2.13) has been released almost one and a half
year ago - quite a long time.  Some months ago,  my 1200 died due to some
unexpected voltage hitting the motherboard (good hint: take care that the
hard drive power connector cable is really good attached, and can't leave
it's place ...)
Now I found time to get the contents of my harddrive burned to CD, making
it possible to access the data again :-)  As I currently have no Amiga at
all and don't intend to purchase a "classic" one again, I decided that it
would be of no benefit to let the source lay around here.  Thus  I  spoke
with Herbert Breuer who started the 2.x versions and we agreed to publish
the source and thus AIDE under the GPL. 

After almost 18 months  and not having seen my harddrive contents for al-
most a quarter of a year,  I had some problems to see  whether the source
tree is equal to 2.13  or whether I started to implement some new things.
That's the reason I published the 2.12 version as well.  The source found
in this directory is identical to the  released  AIDE,  version 2.12.  Of
course I can't make any promises  whether it will compile  with your very
own assembler ;-(
The directory "latest" contains the latest source.  I am quite sure  that
it should assemble.  You will find a file inc/rexx.i containing some rou-
tines to manage a Rexx port. Please note  that the Rexx port is currently
NOT working!!!  You will note (see main/iconify.i)  that the Rexx port is
opened.  But you will also note  that lines  where it is accessed etc are
commented out.  That's because there is a bug somewhere.  Be careful with
this version  -  I had no chance to test it lately because of the missing
Amiga and thus the difficulty to assemble and run it!

You will also see some .muib files -->  load them into MUIBuilder and you 
can see my attempts for a layout for AIDE in MUI. But that's it.

Furthermore I want to apologize that  99% of the comments are in  German.
As of the big size of the source code I really don't want to translate it
into English. Perhaps a dictionary could help :))    But in case that you
want to do serious development and need some comments translated, you can
of course ask me nonetheless to translate some you really need!
Fortunately most of the var names are in English ;)

Okay, have fun. For questions about the source, AIDE, etc. don't hesitate
to contact me at the address found below.   Please  do also take the time
to read the introduction to the GPL at the end of this text. In case that
you are unfamiliar with it,  you may also want to take a look at the file
"COPYING".
