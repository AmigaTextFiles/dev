 <P ALIGN=CENTER>
 Just another new version of the ACE Integrated Development Environment.
 Now it is possible to use the new versions of the SuperOptimizer :-) thus
 allowing even faster and shorter ACE programs :-)).
 Furthermore the locale.library is now fully supported, allowing you
 to have your AIDE windows in your own language (if you are missing
 a language feel free to translate the enclosed catalog ;-))
 For minor changes take a look at the <A HREF="#history">history</A>.
 </P>

 <H3 ALIGN=LEFT> <I> IMPORTANT !!! </I> </H3>

 <P ALIGN=LEFT>
 For supporting the new superoptimizer versions it has been necessary
 to change the configuration file.
 <UL>
 <LI> The MenuPen setting has been removed and replaced by the setting
    of the used SuperOptimizer version.
 <LI> The way the used SuperOptimizer level is stored has changed.
 </UL>
 All other settings are fully compatible! You just have to go through
 all of your configuration files and to reconfigure the level (and of
 course the version of the SuperOptimizer). This should not be that
 much work compared with the new ability of AIDE.

 <A NAME="#TOC"> </A>

 <H2> Introduction </H2>

 <P>
 AIDE stands for "ACE Integrated Development Environment". It is a
 <A HREF="#finalcomments">freely distributable</A> graphical front-end
 for the development of ACE programs. By using AIDE you will never need
 again to start from a shell when developing ACE programs (although you
 may <A HREF="#spawnshell">spawn a shell</A>
 by selecting an item from AIDE's Project Menu.

 <A NAME="requirements">

 <H2>System Requirements</H2>

 <P>
 AIDE requires at least AmigaOS Release 2.04. There is no chance that
 it will run on any lower OS release. Furthermore, AmigaOS releases
 before 2.1 don't support localized programs (AIDE will run nonethe-
 less, but will use the default english texts).
 <P>
 AIDE will be comfortable with 0.5 megabyte RAM. (But ACE might get
 trouble then) AIDE does use only 4096 bytes of stack and does set up
 a stack size of 40000 bytes for any process run by it (esp. ACE will
 be very grateful ;-)

 <HR>

 <A NAME="install">

 <H2>Installing AIDE</H2>

 <P>
 Since version 2.13 installing AIDE is very comfortable. Just use the
 Installerscript.

 <P>
 If there are problems using the script, here is a "do-it-yourself"
 explanation.

 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 Before starting AIDE for the first time, you must have ACE
 installed correctly with the following corresponding directories:

 <UL>
 <LI> ACE:
 <LI> ACE:AIDE (copy AIDE in this directory!)
 <LI> ACE:bin
 <LI> ACElib: (ACE:lib)
 <LI> ACEinclude: (ACE:include)
 <LI> ACEbmaps: (ACE:bmaps)
 </UL>

 If these dirs aren't set up correctly, AIDE will abort with an error
 message. Same if one of the following files are not in the right
 directory:

 <UL>
 <LI> mrt.library (in LIBS:)
 <LI> thinpaz.font (in FONTS:)
 </UL>

 <P>
 I recommend to have the followings directories as well:
 <UL>
 <LI> ACE:Docs (where all the docs reside)
 <LI> ACE:Icons (where the necessary icons for ACE should be)
 <LI> ACE:Mods (where your compiled SubMods reside)
    <P> <EM>ATTENTION:</EM>
	    Subdirectories are not allowed! Please copy
	    all your modules into ACE:Mods/, otherwise
	    the modules will not be available.
 <LI> ACE:prgs (where your source code resides)
 <LI> ACE:run (where your executables are going)
 <LI> ACE:temp (where your temporary files during compilation are going)
    <P> <EM>ATTENTION:</EM>
	    "ACE:temp/" is the DEFAULT directory for
	    temporary files during compilation. To save
	    memory they are not any longer stored in T:
	    (if the default would be T: and T: resides in
	    memory the source file would be two times in
	    memory) As memory's always short, it's better
	    to have the temporary dir on HD and not in
	    RAM:. Change this to your personal taste.
	    Furthermore it might be dangerous to use T:,
	    as AIDE deletes ALL files in the temp direc-
	    tory if resetting a source, ...
 <LI> ACE:utils (where all the ACE related utilities reside)
 </UL>
 If those dirs do not exist, AIDE's internal <A HREF="#configuration">
 configuration</A> part gives you the possibility to do the <A HREF="#setup">
 setup</A> to your personal need.
</blockquote>
 <HR>

 <A NAME="Configuration">

 <H2> Configuration </H2>

 <P>
 AIDE will create a new file called AIDE2.config to run properly. If
 you've old config files from AIDE 1.5 and before, your settings will
 be copied to the new file. You can later delete the old files, if
 you wish. You can not edit the new file anymore, just use the
 integrated <A HREF="#setup"> setup </A> part in AIDE.

 <P>
 No AIDE2.config is included in the AIDE archive. If there does not
 exist one, AIDE will create one with the default settings.

 <P>
 If all the directories exist, <A HREF="#install"> as mentioned above </A>,
 AIDE will create the setup in this way that you do not need to setup
 these settings manually. Only for options like PubScreen, Requester,
 ... you need to open the <A HREF="#link">setup window</A>, anything
 else is already done.

 <P>
 As AIDE has no built-in editor you have to specify your favourite
 one (cmp. <A HREF="#setup">setup</A>, otherwise "C:Ed" is used ...)
 Note, that the specified editor MUST be capable of taking command-
 line arguments (e.g. a file name). Same applies to the viewer
 (default: AmigaGuide/Multiview).

 <HR>

 <A NAME="menu">

 <H2>AIDE's menus</H2>

 <P>
 There exist three pull-down menus in AIDE: Project, Utilities and
 Help. The Project menu is for general house-keeping tasks, the
 Utilities menu provides access to a number of useful programs and
 the Help menu gives you access to documentation for the compiler,
 assembler, linker and the ACE language.

 <DL>
  <DT> Project menu
   <DD> <UL>
	  <LI> <A HREF="#open">Open ...</A>
	  <LI> <A HREF="#view">View ...</A>
	  <LI> <A HREF="#rename">Rename ...</A>
	  <LI> <A HREF="#copy">Copy ...</A>

	</UL>
  <DT> Utilities menu
   <DD>
    Here you find some useful utilities (not within the AIDE package).
    The corresponding program must be in the right directory as men-
    tioned in the <A HREF="install">installing section</A>, or there
    must be an entry in AIDE's <A HREF="setup">setup window</A>.
    Please note, that AB2ASCII is a little bit buggy. If you want to
    improve it, well, do it!
    <UL>
     <LI> Calculator: Invokes the calculator
     <LI> ReqEd: Invokes ReqEd
     <LI> Create BMAP file(s): Converts FD file(s) for a library into a
	      .bmap file used by ACE and AmigaBASIC
	      when calling shared library functions.
	      The .bmap file is stored in the ACEbmaps:
	      directory.
	      A file requester for selection is invoked
	      and you can select only one, all, or the
	      specific files you want to convert.
     <LI> AmigaBASIC to ASCII: Converts a compressed AmigaBASIC file in-
	      to an ASCII text file for use by ACE. In-
	      vokes a file requester for selection of
	      the input and output dir and file name.
     <LI> UppercACEr: Invokes UppercACEr. <EM>Important:</EM>
	      UppercACEr.Reserved must reside in S:<BR>

	      In any case you don't have to worry about
	      the filenames. AIDE handles that for you.
	      The converted file will have an _u exten-
	      sion to the filename.
     <LI> Utility 0 to 3: Here you have the possibility to specify
	      any utility of your choice. A correspon-
	      ding entry in AIDE2.config must exist!

	      You can only use tools, which don't need
	      an argument to run (this may be changed
	      in a future release).
    </UL>
  <DT> Help menu
   <DD> This menu provides access to the documentation for the compiler,
	SuperOptimizer, assembler and linker from within AIDE.
	In addition, access to the ACE Language Reference manual ACE
	examples, ACE history and this document can be gained via the
	Help menu. The Help function'll do nothing if no viewer at all
	is specified. Furthermore, all the supported doc files must be
	in your specified "Doc Dir". The supported docs are:
	<UL>
	 <LI> AIDE.doc/AIDE.guide
	 <LI> ACE.doc/ACE.guide
	 <LI> SuperOptimizer.guide
	 <LI> A68K.doc
	 <LI> PhxAss.guide
	 <LI> BLink.doc
	 <LI> PhxLnk.guide

	 <LI> example.guide
	 <LI> history
	 <LI> ACEcalc.doc (/ACEcalc.guide if available)
	 <LI> ReqEd.doc  (/ReqEd.guide if available)
	</UL>
    Note:
    The docs must exist under the names described above. AIDE re-
    lies on them. If you have other docs, you can view them with
    the function <A HREF="#view">View</A> from the "Project" menu in any case.
 </DL>

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Open">

 <H2> Open ... </H2>

 <P>
 Invokes the editor with a file name which you must specify via a
 file requester. If no file name is given, AIDE will inform you with
 a message.
 This option is included to edit any file of your choice. For editing
 the source file see below. The current used dir will be remembered,
 so you don't have to switch to all the directories again.
 </P>

 <HR>

 <A NAME="View">

 <H2>View ...</H2>

 <P>
 Lets you view a file which is selected via a file requester. Remem-
 bers the current dir.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Rename">

 <H2> Rename ... </H2>

 <P>
 Lets you rename a file specified via a file requester. Remembers the
 current dir.
 First a file requester will be opened where you have to select a
 file, which you want to rename. Now a second file requester appears
 where you have to select the new name. You can change the directory
 name, too, so a rename has the same effect as "move a file". This is
 only possible for the same device.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Copy">

 <H2>Copy ...</H2>

 <P>
 Lets you copy a file specified via a file requester. Remembers the
 current dir.
 There will be also two file requester: the first one to choose the
 source file, the second one to choose the destination dir and file
 name. If you change the name for the destination file, it will be
 copied with the new name.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Delete">

 <H2>Delete ...</H2>

 <P>
 Lets you delete a file specified via a file requester. Remembers the
 current dir.

 <P>
 Note:
 No second requester will appear, asking, whether you really want to
 delete this file. You can't double click the filename. You have to
 choose "OK" to perform the action.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Print">

 <H2>Print ...</H2>

 <P>
 Lets you choose a file to print via a file requester. Remembers the
 current dir.

 <P>
 Note:
 This function is very simple. It uses your printer preferences, as
 setup via the prefs tool from your workbench disk. No page check-
 ing, no formatting, nothing else is done.
 The function prints files, no matter which size, when they can be
 loaded in memory.
 This may be more comfortable in a future release. ;-)

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Execute">

 <H2>Execute ...</H2>

 <P>
 Allows an AmigaDOS command to be executed. The command and its argu-
 ments are entered into an input requester, a console window is open-
 ed for any I/O associated with the command and the latter is execu-
 ted if possible.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="spawnshell">

 <H2>Spawn Shell</H2>

 A NewShell process is started for more comprehensive house-keeping
 tasks than the <A HREF="#execute">Execute ...</A> option is intended
 for. Your default settings as defined in S:Shell-Startup are used.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="loadconf">

 <H2> Load Config File and Save Config File </H2>

 <P>
 You can create now multiple config files. With these two functions
 you can load/save now the default or any other config file.
 "Default" will try to load/save a file named ACE:AIDE/AIDE2.config and
 "other" will bring up a file requester where you can specify any directory
 and filename of your choice.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="About">

 <A HREF="#finalcomments"><H2>About</H2></A>

 Brings up a message box telling you briefly about AIDE.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Iconify">

 <H2>Iconify</H2>

 AIDE does now allow you to close the main window and to have an app-
 icon on the workbench. To wake AIDE up you just have to double-click
 on the appicon.

 <P>
 Note: To work properly, the AIDE icon (AIDE.info) must reside in the
    directory ACE:AIDE/. If this isn't the case, AIDE will use the
    default program icon (as can be specified via IconEdit) for
    the appicon.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Quit">

 <H2>Quit AIDE</H2>

 <P>
 Exits from AIDE. (You can also click the close gadget of the main
 window.) Depending on the settings <A HREF="#setup">(see SetUp)</A>
 you will be asked whether you want to quit AIDE.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="Setup">

 <H2>Setup</H2>

 <P>
 This is completely new (in comparison to v1.x), so you don't have to
 edit a config file outside of AIDE. All the settings you change
 there will be active immediately (despite of one).

 <P>
 Just one word to the default font setting:

 "Thinpaz.font" is used so all the gadgets will fit in a window which
 can be displayed on a standard NTSC screen. For those who use a
 higher resolution of their Workbench screen, the option "Public
 Screen" can be used.

 <H3>Directory Setup:</H3>

 <P>
 Well, when you choose AIDE setup the main window will be closed and
 the setup window will be opened. On the left side there are all the
 string gadgets for the directory setup. If you want to change the
 names manually you can do it there. If you type an error the old
 entry will be displayed again and the string gadget will be set to
 active state.
 When you select the "R" button ("R" means requester), right beside
 the string gadget, an ASL file requester will pop up where you can
 choose a directory or file name of your choice.

 <P>
 Note:
 If only a directory is necessary for the setup a selected file name
 will be ignored.
 If no file name is selected where one is absolutely necessary, your
 choice will not be accepted.

 <H3>Other:</H3>

 <DL>
  <DT> Public Screen
   <DD> Here you have the choice to define, if AIDE should run on an
    own public screen. This screen'll have "Shanghai" abilities.
    That means that all windows which would normally be opened on
    the Workbench screen, will now be opened on the AIDE screen.
    The AIDE screen will close automatically if the AIDE window
    and all the visitor windows are closed.
    <P>
    This is the only setting which will have effect, when you
    start AIDE again after saving your config file as default
    (AIDE2.config).
    <P>
    This may be changed in a future release.
  <DT> Requester
   <DD> Here you have the choice to define:
	All:  all requester will be displayed
	Error: only error requester will be displayed
	Min:  only fatal error requester will be displayed!
    <P>
    Just try it out and set this flag to your personal taste.

  <DT> Clean up
   <DD> Here you have the choice to define:
	<DL>
	 <DT> Yes
	  <DD> This is the default setting and that means that
	       all the temporary files will be deleted when
	       you quit AIDE.
	 <DT> No
	  <DD> If you select this, then no temporary files
	       will be deleted when you quit AIDE. That may be
	       useful if you want to have a look at those
	       files later. Older versions of AIDE will always
	       delete those files.
	       Still, all temporary files will be deleted when
	       you perform a new compiler run.
	</DL>
  <DT> SuperOpt
   <DD> Here you can define whether you want to use the new versions
	of the SuperOptimizer (2.x) or the old ones (1.x). Depending
	on this setting AIDE gives you different requesters when
	setting the optimization level. (since AIDE v2.13)
 </DL>

 <HR>


 <A NAME="tooltypes">

 <H2>Icon Tooltypes</H2>

 <P>
 You can configure AIDE now via the tooltypes entry of the source
 file icon and the AIDE program icon. The defined tooltypes are:

 <DL>
  <DT> FILETYPE  = ACESource
   <DD>
	  If you are using icons for your source files,
	  this tooltype must be set if you wish the source
	  file to be set within AIDE.<BR>
	  Note:
	  This entry is ignored if set in the AIDE program
	  icon.

  <DT> CONFIGFILE = AIDE2.config
   <DD> or any other config file name you've
	specified for this source file.

  <DT> PRECO = app
   <DD> or any other precompiler you want to use with
	this source file (preferable NAP ;-).<BR>
	  Note:
	  An example source icon is in the AIDE archive.
 </DL>

 <HR>

 <A NAME="mainwindow">

 <H2>Main Window</H2>

 <A NAME="source">

 <H2>Source</H2>

 <P>
 <DL>
  <DT> Set
   <DD>  Lets you specify the ACE source file to work with,
	 via a file requester. Some gadgets are not access-
	 ible until this has been done for the first time.
	 The file requester for "Set Source..." starts up in
	 the directory which was referenced the last time
	 option was invoked.
	 If the file selected does not exist, AIDE'll invoke
	 the editor.
  <DT> Reset
   <DD>  Resets the current source file for a new compiler
	 run. Useful if you did invoke the editor outside of
	 AIDE.
  <DT> Edit
   <DD>  Invokes the editor with the current source file as
	 its argument. If no editor is specified, this
	 option will be disabled
 </DL>

 <HR>

 <A NAME="program">

 <H2>Program</H2>

 <DL>
  <DT> Precompile
   <DD> This will invoke the specified precompiler with the
	current source file as its argument. No check, if
	the source file was already precompiled is done.
  <DT> Compile
   <DD> This will invoke ACE and the SuperOptimizer (if set
	to active). No check if the source file was already
	compiled is done.
  <DT> Assemble
   <DD> This will invoke the selected assembler. No check
	if the source file was already assembled is done.
  <DT> Link
   <DD> This will invoke the selected linker. No check if
	the source file was already linked is done.
  <DT> Run
   <DD> Runs the current program, compiling it first if
	necessary.

	 Important:

	 This functions can now be used for CLI programs,
	 too, but no input box will appear. If you need to
	 specify a command line argument use "Run in Shell"
	 instead. But if you do not need to enter command
	 line arguments, this function will do now the same
	 task.

  <DT> Run in Shell
   <DD>  Runs the current program in a shell, compiling it
	 first if necessary. Before the program is run, AIDE
	 asks for command line arguments via an input box.
	 Supply no arguments if none are required, or use
	 "Run" instead.
 </DL>

 <P>
 <EM>Important:</EM>

 The buttons in the "Program" section will not change their state if
 you change any names/options for <A HREF="#precompiler">precompiler</A>,
 <A HREF="#aceoptions">ACE</A>, <A HREF="#assembler">assembler</A>,
 <A HREF="#linker">linker lib</A> or <A HREF="#linker">linker</A> and
 the internal state of the <A HREF="#makeproc">make process</A>
 won't be affected either.

 <P>
 If you did change the options just select the corresponding buttons
 in the "Program" section to perform the missing steps of your com-
 pilation process.
 This habit differs completely from older versions of AIDE. It was
 done this way, so that the program is not recompiled completly, be-
 cause only the assembler or linker option had been changed.

 <P>
 If you want to perform a new compiler run, just select "Reset" from
 the <A HREF="#source">source section</A> and "Make Executable" or
 whatever AIDE should do for you.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="make">

 <H2> Make </H2>

 <P>
 <DL>
  <DT> Executable
   <DD> <A HREF="#makeproc">Makes</A> the current program, putting all
	 intermediate files and the final executable program into
	 the temporary working directory.
  <DT> Application
   <DD> Does the same as "Make Executable" but also copies
	the final executable from temporary storage to
	ACE:Run. This is the default.
	If the default is overwritten with an empty entry,
	the executable goes to the root directory where
	AIDE resides.
	An icon is also copied. That is the default for
	"Make Application". You don't need to specify
	"Create Icon" for the <A HREF="#aceoptions">ACE options</A>.
  <DT> Module
   <DD>  Creates an object module which can later be linked
	 with any ACE program. The only difference between
	 this option and Make Executable (above) is that no
	 linking occurs and ACE's -m switch is used. See also
	 "Creating and using ACE subprogram modules" in
	 ace.doc.<BR>
	 The object module goes to ACE:Mods (default), or
	 where the entry in AIDE2.config points to. If this
	 is empty, the module goes to the root directory,
	 where AIDE resides.

	 The displayed module list will be updated if the
	 entry point in your configuration is setup correctly.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="precompiler">

 <H2>Precompiler</H2>

 <P>
  The mutual exclusive buttons gives you the possibility to choose
  APP, ACPP or any other precompiler to be used to precompile your
  source file.

 <P>
  If you select "other", an input box will pop up where you can
  enter the name of your desired precompiler.

 <P>
  If you choose DCPP then the options will be set up correctly
  to be used for ACE programs. DCPP is much faster as ACPP and
  does the same task.

 <P>
  I recommend to use NAP (guess why ;-) as it's almost as fast as
  ACPP (and I hope it will be faster the next versions) and does
  the same task as ACPP and APP together (processing defines, C
  comments AND ACE comments!)

 <P>
  If no precompiler name is entered, the button of your last
  selected one will be activated again and an existing precompiler
  name will be deleted.

 <P>
  Clicking the close gadget of the window will ignore all what you
  may have entered in the string gadget. If your settings should
  take effect press &lt;RETURN&gt;.

  other - If you select this button an input box will pop up and
       give you the possibility to enter any kind of ACE option which may be defined new for the future. Use this
       as well if you want to specifiy "list source line".

       You have to enter the options as defined in ACE.doc. If
       no "space" is required, then don't enter it.

       If you enter an empty string here all options which may
       be defined before will be deleted.

       Clicking the close gadget of the window will ignore all
       what you may have entered in the string gadget. If your
       settings should take effect press &lt;RETURN&gt.

 <A NAME="superopt">

 <H2>SuperOptimizer</H2>

 <P>
 Here you can choose if you want to use the SuperOptimzer from Manuel
 Andre. With "Set Level" you can define how much optimization you
 want. Depending on your "SuperOpt version" (see <A HREF="#setup">SetUp</A>
 part) you have two ways to change it:

 <DL>
  <DT> SuperOptimizer 1.x
  <DD>
  The known window will pop up and allow you to enter a value between 0 and 12.

  <DT>SuperOptimizer 2.x
  <DD>
  A window will pop up where all 17 possible optimizations are listed. Choose the ones you like. When finished you can close the
  window by using the close gadget.
 </DL>

 Note:
 Due to this the configuration file has changed a little bit. Refer
 to the <A HREF="#preface">preface</A> of this manual, please.

 Note:
 The SuperOptimizer is used in combination with the make process of
 ACE. If you did change the level you have to recompile the source
 again with ACE using the "Compile" button.

 If you did switch off the Superoptimizer, you don't have to recompile again, because the unoptimized file <name>.s still exists and
 AIDE will use this one instead of <name>_opt.s.

 In a future release it might be possible to select the SuperOptimizer separately.

 <A NAME="viewsection">

 <H2>View</H2>

 <P>
 <DL>
  <DT> Precompiled Source
  <DD> Allows you to view the preprocessed source file.

  <DT> Assembly Source
  <DD> Allows you to view the target assembly source file which
       results from compiling a program.

  <DT> Compiler Errors
  <DD> Lets you see the errors (if any) generated by the last
       compilation with ACE.
 </DL>

 Note, that these options are only available if a viewer has been
 specified.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="assembler">

 <H2>Assembler</H2>

 <P>
 Here you can choose which assembler you like to use. A68K and PhxAss
 (see the corresponding doc files for more details) are fully supported from AIDE.

 <P>
 Just select the desired options, or enter new ones with the
 "Set Options" buttons. All what you enter has to be done the same
 way as if you would type them at the Shell prompt. For A68K and
 PhxAss the options are set in the right place of the command string.
 PhxAss ist set to NULL for optimizing the assembly output. It does
 depend on your program which optimizing options you can use. Read
 the docs carefully and try them. Optimizing the assembly output results in shorter/faster executables.
 If you want to change the optimization level of PhxAss the new level
 has to be the first thing entered in the "Set Options" window WITHOUT the OPT command!!! If you do not want to change the optimization
 level but add some other options you MUST have a 0 as first char in
 your "Set Options" window!

 <P>
 When you specify another assembler via the "other" button then the
 options will be added after the name of the file which has to be
 assembled and the name of the object file.

 <P>
 Example:

 You choose superasm as your "other" assembler. The default command
 string for assembling will then be:
  <keyb>
   ACE:BIN/superasm <filename>.s <options><filename>.o
  </keyb>

 Be aware that there is NO space between the options set via "Set
 Options" and the output filename (because it might be that your
 assembler expects the output file passed as -o<filename>). So don't
 forget to add a space after the options if this is not the case!
 If your assembler does not allow you to specify an output file the
 last sign of your options must be a semicolon thus stating the output filename as comment. But be aware tha t you can not use the
 SuperOptimizer anymore if your assembler does not allow other output files as the linker won't recognize the filename!

 <P>
 <EM>Attention:</EM>

 If you did define options for A68K and you switch to PhxAss then
 you have to delete those options first, otherwise they will be used
 also for PhxAss. This will result in an error message from PhxAss.

 <P>
 <DL>
  <DT> Small Code/Small Data model:
  <DD>
 Please read the corresponding docs for the assemblers to this point
 very very carefully. Not all assemblers does the same task!!!
 Don't choose these options if you are not sure what they are doing.

  <DT> Debug Info:
  <DD>
 If you select this, A68K or PhxAss will create a symbol table for
 all the labels and variable names which exists in the .s file. This
 is especially helpful if also "Assembly Comment" is selected as ACE
 option.
 The compiled program can then be watched with a symbol debugger
 like MonAm. And you can compare it with your assembly source file.
 If you are not capable of assembler this option is of no use for
 you.
 </DL>

 <HR>

 <A NAME="linkerlib">

 <H2>Linker Lib</H2>

 <P>
 Here you can choose which linker lib despite of the defaults db.lib
 and startup.lib, which are linked always, should be used. For PhxLnk
 you can use the standard Amiga.lib instead of Ami.lib.

 <P>
 Important:

 Blink will crash if you try to link Amiga.lib!!!!!!

 <HR>

 <A NAME="linkersection">

 <H2>Linker</H2>

 <P>
 Here you choose which linker you like to use. BLink and PhxLnk are
 fully supported by AIDE.

 <P>
 What I did say about the handling of the "Set Options" button above
 in the <A HREF="#assembler">assembler</A> chapter is also valid for the linker part. So read
 the linker docs carefully if you want to use other options as predefined in AIDE.

 <DL>
  <DT> SmallCode:
  <DD>
   If you choose this option the supported linkers will link all your
   program code into one piece. This results in shorter executable but
   can't be "scattered loaded". See, in any case, the corresponding
   linker docs files for the details.
  <DT> Small Data:
  <DD>
   This has the same effect for the data section of your program as
   described above for the program section.
 </DL>

 <P>
 <EM>Important:</EM>

 PhxLnk links all data sections into one piece, no matter if for
 some special ones the Chip mem bit is set! This can result in the
 effect that some machines are reporting "not enough memory" if they
 try to load a program wich was linked with PhxLnk and this option
 set. That happens, because ACE creates large data sections (depending on the used amount of variables) which has to be loaded to
 Chip mem now. Machines with only 512k and sometimes those with
 1Mega byte of chip mem, will report "not enough memory".

 <P>
 PhxLnk has options to force Chip mem data sections to Chip mem and
 all the other data sections to Fast mem, but that has to be done
 inside of the assembler source file. :-(  This is not possible for
 normal :-) ACE programmers. We only can hope that Klaus will be so
 kind to add an option to PhxLnk, so this'll be done automatically.

 <P>
 Blink separates Chip mem data sections from the others, so this'll
 not happen with BLink.

 <P>
 In any case you should be aware, that this option only makes sense,
 if also the assembler option was set to SmallCode/Small Data. If it
 was not (and ACE does not allow SmallCode/Small Data for all your
 programs) and SmallCode/Small Data option set for the linker only,
 results in programs which can have loading problems on machines
 with less memory and high memory fragmentation.

 <DL>
  <DT> No Debug Info:
  <Dd>
   If you select this option the program will be linked ignoring all
   defined symbol table entries, if they exist.
 </DL>

 <HR>

 <A NAME="module">

 <H2>Module</H2>

 <P>
 All SUBMods which resides in the specified "Module Dir" are displayed
 in the main window. Just click on the name to select the one you
 want to link and the choosen one will be highlighted. Clicking on a
 selected entry results in unselecting it. If you want to remove all
 modules just click on the button "Remove all Modules"
 <P>
 There is no limit for the amount of Modules defined which can be
 linked.
 <P>
 The amount is only limited by the length of the command line the
 linker accepts for input. My testing did result in about 20 modules
 as maximum (depending on the length of the file name). The buffer of
 AIDE allows up to 120 modules until an error message is displayed.

 <P>
 Note:

 No checking of the filename is done, only directory names are
 ignored. Therefore you can place any type of linkable file into
 your "Module Dir".
 If you want to link other linker libs as predefined just place them
 here and select them as described above.

 <P>
 Note:

 If you want to save your option <A HREF="#setup">settings</A> from the
 main window, use <A HREF="#loadconf">Save Configuration</A> from the
 <A HREF="#menu">Project</A> menu. All your settings  will be saved in
 AIDE2.config (default) or in another file if you wish to do so.

 <HR>

 <A NAME="makeproc">

 <H2>AIDE's "Make" Process</H2>

 <P>
 As you may have gleaned from the above, AIDE has a simple inbuilt
 "make" capability.

 <P>
 This means that before it builds or makes an exectuable and prior to
 compiling or running a program, AIDE checks to see whether compilation needs to take place at all.
 <P>
 If you have created an executable and then decide to run it, AIDE
 will not recompile the source first. Likewise, if you want to build
 an executable and the program has already been compiled, the executable will be copied from AIDE's temporary workspace only.
 <P>
 In like manner, if you have compiled a program to produce an assembly source file, so long as you don't edit the ACE source file,
 AIDE will not recompile the program before assembling and linking
 it.
 <P>
 If you want to recompile select <A HREF="#source">Source Reset</A>
 or do it step by step with the buttons in the <A HREF="#program">Program</A>
 section.
 <P>
 On the other hand if you edit a source file, next time you go to run
 it, AIDE will "bring the program up to date" by compiling,
 assembling and linking it first.
 <P>
 If you forgot to link some modules just select them and select
 "Link" from the <A HREF="#program">Program</A> section.
 <P>
 In order to preprocess, compile, assemble and link a program, AIDE
 now uses the DOS function SystemTagList(). An intuition window will
 be opened to watch the progress of your compilation run. If you
 select "Stop" there, the next step will not be taken. If you want to
 stop immediately you have to press Ctrl-C in the CON: window, which
 was also opened to display the current output from ACE and the other
 programs. But not all programs, used to make an executable, accept
 Ctrl-C, therefore the "Stop" button was added.
 <P>
 Note:

  Only the next step can be aborted via the "Stop" button, because
  SystemTagList() didn't return before and did give the control back
  to AIDE.

 <P>
 If an error or user break occurs during preprocessing or compilation, AIDE will stop and give the control back to the user.

 One last word: AIDE is freeware. This means, you are allowed to copy
 it freely as long as all files stay unaltered and no file is missing
 in the copy. As the author does not want any money for AIDE, you are
 not allowed either to demand money for copying AIDE.
