Author:   dseifert@berlin.sireco.net (Daniel Seifert)
Type:     dev/basic
Version:  2.03 (07-25-1997) (06-07-1998)

This is the source code of NAP. NAP is a preprocessor 
which has been developed especially for the ACE 
programming language.

Features : - processing of the following preprocessor
             commands: IF, ELSE, ELIF, ENDIF, INCLUDE,
             DEFINE, IFDEF, IFNDEF, UNDEF
           - removal of C comments, e.g. /*   */, AND
             ACE comments, e.g. {   } and '.
           - removal of unused structures (thus gaining
             memory during compilation)

Changes  : - sets exit code correctly
           - minor optimizations


*N*O*T*E*

 This will be the last version of NAP. I decided to stop
 that project (even as there are some bugs)  as there is
 no feedback. NAP is cardware for over a year now but so
 far I never received a postcard. I interprete this as a
 sign that NAP is not used by anybody ;-(

 Therefore I decided to put NAP under the GNU Public
 License:
