Just a short appendix to the manuel (not for interest except you
are using AIDE).

 But first: This whole Readme file has been put into that archive
            by me (Daniel Seifert) so don't blame Manuel if there
            is something wrong with it,  but direct all flames to
            d.seifert@monos.insider.org or just forget it ;-)



 It is NOT possible to use LinkAEP with AIDE in the way it is des-
 cribed within the manual.

     1. There is no linker menu. (he certainely meant the right
        thing, but anyway ;-)
     2. The modules HAVE TO BE linked BEFORE db.lib and so on as
        they have to replace the old functions. But if you select
        them at the modules window or if you enter them at the
        "Other Linker Options" text gadget they are linked AFTER
        db.lib ...

 Therefore I wrote a little script called LinkAEP which will be
 automatically copied to ACE:bin/. Select "Other Linker" from
 AIDE's main window and type "LinkAEP". You might want to edit
 the file (ACE:bin/LinkAEP) a little bit to make use of another
 Linker than PhxLnk or to use the Math020 module as well. It's
 described within the script how to do this.
