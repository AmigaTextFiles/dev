; LinkAEP - © by Daniel Seifert (d.seifert@monos.insider.org) 1997
;
; This little script allows AIDE to make use of Manuel Andre's
; AEP (ACE Enhancement Project). It's the only way - the infor-
; mation in the manual is wrong!!! (first, there is no "linker
; menu", second all additional options are put at the end of the
; command string - ACE's function would be linked in instead of
; Manuel's replacement commands!)
;
; How to use
;
; Just enter "ACE:BIN/LinkAEP" (yeah, put LinkAEP into ACE:BIN)
; as "Other Linker" (right top of the main window).
; That's all ;-)
;
; Setting
;
; You have to uncomment the line with the correct linker you
; are using. (Default: PhxLnk)
; Furthermore as a default only the StringLib.o file is linked.
; If you want to link ACEMath020.o as well, just put it before
; "{rest}". In case you wanna use the AceImage.lib you can put
; it there as well - but you might also use the "Other Options"
; gadget in the linker section of AIDE's main window (it's no
; replacement therefore it isn't needed to link it before db.lib).

; Well, not much to copyright ;-) Do whatever you want with it.
; It's yours. But you have to erase my name from the script if
; you change something and distribute it!


; And here it is: (such a long documentation for these five lines ;-)

.key ace_object/A,rest/F
.bra {
.ket }

; If you use PhxLnk, uncomment this line:
ACE:bin/PhxLnk {ace_object} ACELIB:StringLib.o {rest}

; If you use BLink, uncomment this line:
; ACE:bin/BLink FROM {ace_object} WITH ACELIB:StringLib.o {rest}
