 Short: ACEcalc v2.0 - Workbench Calculator 
Author: David Benn, D.Benn@appcomp.utas.edu.au

This is version two of my ACEcalc Wb calculator which evaluates infix 
expressions.

This release fixes a couple of problems with the first version relating
to button fonts and exponentiation. See the Changes section in ACEcalc.doc.
