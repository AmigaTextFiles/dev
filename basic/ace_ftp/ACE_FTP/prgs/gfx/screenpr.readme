This is a modified form of Carolyn Scheppner's original AmigaBASIC
screen dump example program from Extras1.3:basicdemos.

It has only been modified in very minor ways before compilation with 
ACE - eg. addition of a few more library function declarations.

It requires the presence of exec.bmap in ACEbmaps:.

The code could use more ACEifying - eg. the use of structures instead 
of a myriad of peeks and pokes.
