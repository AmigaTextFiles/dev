   All are programs I (William F. Maddock) am currently working on, except that since I now have the
PageStream3 JPEG.gfilter, CvtJPG has been kind of made obsolete, besides I haven't been able to get it
to execute the proper commands. Anyway, have fun with them all.

   Availmem we have discussed on the mailing list. They are still in that form. If you can use them as
examples, please feel free.
