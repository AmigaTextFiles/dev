TITLE:  Encrypt
SHORT:  A simple encryption utility written ACE
AUTHOR: ppou203d@liv.ac.uk

This is a simple encryption utility.  I call it PLP [pretty lousy
privacy :)] but it does produce pseduo random code which could lead
someone to believe it was encrypted using the [uncrakable?] one-
time pad method.
