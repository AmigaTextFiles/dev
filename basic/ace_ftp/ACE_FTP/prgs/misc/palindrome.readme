A recursive palindrome program.

Written as a "challenge" (to myself) after reading an article on functional
programming with Scheme to demonstrate that one can easily write programs in
the functional style with ACE. Gee, now all I have to do is implement list
processing and higher order functions. Don't laugh. At least one of these
may yet become part of ACE. I'll let you guess which. :-)
