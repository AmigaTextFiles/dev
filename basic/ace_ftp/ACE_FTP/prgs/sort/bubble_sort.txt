Subject: Bubble sort....
Status: OR

Hi!
  This is my second attempt at posting this code, the first try
was swallowed whole by my wonderful inernet provider and their
magical vanishing network.
  Anyway, I think the code is fairly easy to follow.  The program
creates an array of randomly generated five character words and
then sorts it.
  A bubble sort works like this: on the first pass, every item
in the array, except the last one, is checked to see if it is
larger than the next one.  If it is then it swaps places.  This
happenes all the way down the list, until what you get is the
item with the lowest value at the top of the list.  The item
with the lowest value bubbles to the top, get it?  :)  On the
second and following passes of loop1 the next lowest item bubbles
to the next highest position in the array.
  Well, enough babbling, here's the code.

----------------------------------8<-------------------------
rem Sort an array of randomly generated words

const numitems = 50

dim list$(numitems) SIZE 6

for loop = 1 to numitems
  word$ = ""
  for loop2 = 1 to 5
    word$ = word$ + chr$(int(rnd(1)*26)+97)
  next
  list$(loop) = word$
  print word$
next

print
print "Sorting..."
print

sort:
  for loop1 = 1 to numitems-1

    for loop2 = 1 to numitems-loop1

      if list$(loop2) > list$(loop2+1) then  ' Compare two list items
         temp$ = list$(loop2)                '\
         list$(loop2) = list$(loop2+1)       ' Swap 'em if the second is higher
         list$(loop2+1) = temp$              '/
      end if

    next

  next


for loop = 1 to numitems
  print list$(loop)
next
