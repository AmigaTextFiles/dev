This archive contains a few examples of sorting programs written in 
ACE BASIC. The algorithms demonstrated are:

	- bubble sort
	- comb sort
	- shuffle sort

The programs include timing code so that comparison of performance
is possible. Other algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort & mergesort 
may be included in this archive in the future.
