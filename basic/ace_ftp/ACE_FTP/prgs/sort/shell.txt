Here is a copy of the shell sort.  The shell sort is a variant of the
bubble sort that has been found to be very efficient... in the best case
performs as well as the quick sort, and in the worst case is an order of
magnitude faster than the bubble sort.  I don't have the O() or o()
ratings on this sort handy and I don't feel like doing the analysis
right now.

This code is extracted from an application and reworked to remove the
structure references and variables have been renamed to make more sense.
I don't guarantee that it works as supplied syntactically but the
algorithm and methods are in tact.  Cleaning the code is left as an
exercise for the reader.
