An example of using reqtools.library functions. ReqTools.library must be 
in your LIBS: directory for this program to work. ReqTools.bmap is also
required and is supplied with the ACE: distribution in ACEbmaps:.

This is a modified version of the program found in ACE:prgs/library which
correctly extracts the volume/directory name from the file requester
structure.
