Here's several examples of gadtools.library programming in ACE.

Copy all the ".h" files in this archive over to your ACEinclude: directory. 

You will need Wb 2.0 or higher and the .bmap files for gadtools.library, 
intuition.library, utility.library and exec.library.

A vote of thanks goes to Kendall Sears who helped me sort out a problem
with the ListView gadget example.
