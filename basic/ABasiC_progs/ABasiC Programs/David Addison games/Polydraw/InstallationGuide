This distribution requires components from the Workbench and
Extras (AbasiC) disks to build a bootable disk containing Polydraw and
Polyfractals.  The following instructions should be sufficient to build
a bootable disk assuming a system with two disk drives.  Other 
configurations must be custom built.

Lines that begin with "1>" are lines that are to be entered as commands.
Lines that begin with "#" are comments about the "1>" lines.

# Clone a standard Workbench disk.  After booting and escaping to a CLI
# window, type the following command, then insert the Workbench in df0:
# (if not already there) and a blank disk in df1:

1> diskcopy df0: to df1:

# Relabel the newly cloned disk so they can be distinquished.

1> relabel df1: Polydraw

# Chuck the pieces from the new disk that are not necessary.

1> delete Polydraw:Clock#?
1> delete Polydraw:Preferences#?
1> delete Polydraw:Empty#? all
1> delete Polydraw:Demos#? all
1> delete Polydraw:Utilities#? all
1> delete Polydraw:System#? all
1> delete Polydraw:Trashcan#? all

# Now overlay the AbasiC stuff from the Extras disk.  My current version
# of the original Extras disk contains only a half dozen or so files, related
# to AbasiC.

1> copy Extras: Polydraw: all

# Now overlay the Polydraw and Polyfractals files from the Freely
# Redistributable Library disk.  Note that all the contents of the
# Polydraw and Polyfractals directories on the library disk are
# copied to the new disk.

1> copy AmigaLibDisk15:Polydraw Polydraw: all
1> copy AmigaLibDisk15:Polyfractals Polydraw: all

You should now have a bootable Polydraw disk.

Enjoy!
