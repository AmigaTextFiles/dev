This is David Addison's Tunnel Vision game, as sent to me by the
Northwest Amiga Group.  To recreate the bootable games disk, the
general procedures are as follows:

	(1)	Clone a standard workbench disk (I used 1.1).

	(2)	Rename the cloned disk "Tunnel Vision".

	(3)	Delete all the extraneous stuff like the System,
		Utilities, and Demos directories and corresponding
		.info files.

	(4)	Copy ABasiC from the "Extras" disk to the new
		games disk, and name it "Tunnel Vision".  I.E.,
		the ABasiC executable is copied to 
		"Tunnel Vision:Tunnel Vision".  Note the spaces!!

	(5)	Overlay the tunnel vision distribution hierarchy
		onto the new games disk with a command of the form:
		
		copy AmigaLibDisk36:TunnelVision "Tunnel Vision:" all

	(6)	You should now have a bootable games disk.  Have fun!
