This distribution requires components from the 1.0 Workbench and
Extras (AbasiC) disks to build a bootable games disk.  The following
instructions should be sufficient to build a bootable disk assuming a
system with two disk drives.  Other configurations must be custom
built.

Lines that begin with "1>" are lines that are to be entered as commands.
Lines that begin with "#" are comments about the "1>" lines.

# Clone a standard Workbench disk.  After booting and escaping to a CLI
# window, type the following command, then insert the Workbench in df0:
# (if not already there) and a blank disk in df1:

1> diskcopy df0: to df1:

# Relabel the newly cloned disk so they can be distinquished.

1> relabel df1: MileStone

# Chuck the pieces from the new disk that are not necessary.

1> delete MileStone:Clock#?
1> delete MileStone:Preferences#?
1> delete MileStone:Empty#? all
1> delete MileStone:Demos#? all
1> delete MileStone:Utilities#? all
1> delete MileStone:System#? all
1> delete MileStone:Trashcan#? all

# Now overlay the AbasiC stuff from the Extras disk.  My current version
# of the original Extras disk contains only a half dozen or so files, related
# to AbasiC.

1> copy Extras: MileStone: all

# Now overlay the MileStone files from the Freely Redistributable Library
# disk.  Note that all the contents of the MileStone directory on the
# library disk are copied to the new games disk.

1> copy AmigaLibDisk26:MileStone MileStone: all

# Last, and VERY IMPORTANT, rename AbasiC to the name of the game.

1> rename MileStone:AbasiC MileStone/MileStone
1> delete MileStone:AbasiC.info

You should now have a bootable MileStone games disk.

Enjoy!
