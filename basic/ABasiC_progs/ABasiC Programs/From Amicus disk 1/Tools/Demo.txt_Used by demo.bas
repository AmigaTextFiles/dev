    Introducing the AMIGA

The personal supercomputer you don't
have to wait for!   With multi-tasking,
it's like having three or more personal
computers all working at the same time.

Available at fine computer stores
everywhere.  See your dealer to learn
more.

"Casabianca", by Felicia Dorothea Hemans,
is possibly the most parodied poem of all
time.  Nearly everybody knows the first
line; nearly nobody knows the first verse:*
*
The boy stood on the burning deck,*
Whence all but he had fled.*
The flames that lit the battle's wreck*
Shone round him, o'er the dead*
*
