  Well for years now I have kept a secret that I suspect no-one else has
  discovered. I have been testing various projects with my ancient A500
  that has OS1.3x installed BUT for initial tests have used my A1200
  with OS3.xx installed AND use, (present tense), ~AmigaBASIC~ that came
  with my original A500 floppy disk set.

  "BUT AmigaBASIC doesn't work on OS2.0x and above..." would probably be
  your reply and of course you would be correct in that assumption.

  However there is a way around this and I have been using it for at least
  10 years and has caused me no grief for normal usage.

  You don't need ANY software patches, no hidden special libraries or
  any strange third party add-ons to try and get it to work, just a little
  bit of common sense...

  Anyone who knows me also knows that my pet phrase is, "There is ALWAYS
  a back door to anything programming wise for your needs, all you have
  to do is find it..."

  Well here is the back door for AmigaBASIC use... :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You WILL need a Workbench 1.3x bootable disk for this proceedure!!!

  DiskCopy is ALSO required and IS part of the OS3.xx install, it resides
  in the ~SYS:System~ drawer.

  I'll assume a STANDARD A1200HD for this proceedure is being used.

  Righto Here We Go:-
  -------------------

  1) Boot up your A1200 into your normal Workbench.
  2) Open up a Shell.
  3) Type:- "CD SYS:System<RETURN>" without the quotes. CD is not strictly
     required for OS2.0x and above but it always good practice... :)
  4) Insert your Workbench 1.3x bootable disk.
  5) Ensure you have a good second floppy disk ready!!!
     It does NOT need to be formatted.
  6) Type:- "DiskCopy DF0: to DF0:<RETURN>" without the quotes and FOLLOW
     THE ON SCREEN PROMPTS.
  7) Delete ALL files NOT in the ~Listing:-~ below. The ~Listing:-~ files
     ARE ALL required.
  8) Copy AmigaBASIC from an Extras1.3 floppy disk to this bootdisk's
     root directory.
  9) Copy the ~FD1.3~ drawer and contents from an Extras1.3 floppy disk
     to this bootdisk.
 10) Copy ANY ~#?.bmap~ files over to this floppy bootdisk. None are shown
     in this listing.

  CLI.info                         

 12) Rename this disk to AmigaBASIC.
 13) Put a stick on label onto the disk as ~AmigaBASIC~ and away we go.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Startup-Sequence:-
  ------------------

  The ~startup-sequence~ should be as below...

 sys:c/setpatch >NIL:
 sys:c/binddrivers
 sys:c/assign CLIPS: sys:devs/clipboards
 sys:c/assign ENV: sys:t
 sys:c/assign T: sys:t
 sys:c/stack 16384
 sys:c/loadwb -debug
 sys:c/run >NIL: sys:AmigaBASIC
 sys:c/endcli >NIL:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Usage:-
  -------

  Again I'll assume a STANDARD A1200HD is being used.

  1) Put this new bootdisk into drive DF0:
  2) Reboot the A1200HD and immediately go to the early-startup routines.
  3) Go to ~Display Options...~ and set to OCS or ECS, ECS is probably
     better as it gives you more choice, (ECS is what I use)... :)
  4) Click ~Use~ and then go to ~Boot Options...~.
  5) Disable all drives that you don't want.
  6) Disable ALL ~Caches~.
  7) Click ~Use~ and then click ~Boot~ and away we go...
  8) As can be seen it the ~startup-sequence~ AmigaBASIC will auto-run.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Last But Not Least:-
  --------------------

  Although you have booted into Workbench 1.3 you are still using Kickstart
  3.xx so you have the best of both worlds... :)

  Have fun finding simple solutions to often difficult problems... :)

    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    An A1200HD in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes using trapdoor memory AND/OR
    PCMCIA memory expansions. Also tested on an A600HD in 2MB and 6MB modes.
    All test conditions were/are running STANDARD KS2.0x to 3.1x, and using
    standard ~topaz 8~ fonts throughout.

    I have no idea what a strange configuration setup will create so refer
    to the ~The Legal Stuff~ above.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 WARNING.
                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before disconnecting or connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.
