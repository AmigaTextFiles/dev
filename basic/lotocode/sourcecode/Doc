Here's the source code of my LoTo98 lottery predictor and checker
program, I decided to release  this source after running enforcer
and getting loads of hits caused by ACE Basic. You may distribute
and/or compile  any part of this source without any restrictions.
Hopefully  you'll find it useful and will  help you to program, I
must  appologise in advance of the lack of comments as I couldn't
be bothered with them  when I first started. You may also use the
name LoTo98 in any updates to this program, however you shouldn't
state my name or address as being the author, thanks.

Any problems with the source?

contact me...
