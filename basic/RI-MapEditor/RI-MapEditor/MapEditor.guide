@NODE OVERVIEW

Overview of the program
=======================

  This program is an editor for map based programs that allows creation and
editing of any size maps using any size blocks.  It is intuition based and
is controlled by the mouse.  It allows you to load upto 500 different
shapes (Blitz2 shape objects only) and creates maps which can use upto
65535.  Map Editor is primarily for use by owners of @{"Blitz Basic 2" link BLITZ}.

This program was written by @{"Stephen McNamara" link STEVEMAC} and is ©1994
@{"Reflective Images" link US}.

@ENDNODE OVERVIEW

@NODE PROGINFO
The Program
===========

  It was written in June 1994 in @{"Blitz Basic 2" link BLITZ}.

  Why?

  Because the @{"Blitz Basic 2" link BLITZ} map editor is really crap and buggy
(as was most of the software development tools shipped with @{"Blitz Basic 2)" link BLITZ}

My editor is a lot friendly than Blitz's and has the following features:

	o Friendly intuition layout
	o Upto 500 hundred blocks (memory permitting)
	o Blocks can be any size
	o @{"Maps" link LOADAMAP} can have any dimensions (upto 9999 x 9999).
	o Upto 64 @{"Groups" link GROUPS} can be created
	o Groups can have upto 35 shapes in each
	o Expandable @{"map file format" link MAPFILEFORMAT}
	o All map data stored in one file (data, dimensions and groups)
	o Loads in @{"Blitz2 map files" link MAPFILEFORMAT}
	o Loads in 8 bitplane shapes
	o Default file paths
	o and much much more

@NODE USAGE "How do I use it though?"
                          How To Use This Program
                          =======================

The Blitz2 Map Editor User
---------------------------

  If you've used the Blitz2 Map Editor before you shouldn't have many
problems with this program.  The only major different with reagrds to
drawing the map is that instead of having the shapes/groups in scrolling
areas at the top of the screen, they are in a window.  To get at them, just
click on either the @{"SHAPE" link SHAPEWINDOW} or the @{"GROUP" link GROUPWINDOW} gadgets at the top of the screen.
You should, though, read the rest of this doc to make sure you understand
about how this program stores map.

The Novice
----------

  When you first run RI Map Editor you'll be presented with a window.  This
is the Set New Map window which allows you to specify the size of your map
and the size of the blocks that you wish to use with it.  Four text gadgets
in the window are used to change the dimensions, not though that map width
and height are the number of blocks wide and high that the map is.

  At the bottom of the window are two buttons, named LOAD and CREATE.  Load
lets you load a previously saved map in from disk whilst CREATE will create
a new map using the dimensions you entered.  If you select load then you'll
be presented with a file requester where you can select the file to load.
Cancelling or not selecting a file will return you to the New Map Window.

  After you have either created or loaded a new map you'll be shown another
file requester in which you should locate the shapes file that you wish to
use for the map.  Selecting cancel will cause a default black square to be
the only shape you have available to use.  Otherwise, you'll be presented
with the @("Load Shapes Window" link LOADSHAPES}, in which you can configure the loading of the
shapes.

  Now you're at the drawing stage.  The screen is split into 3 areas:

		o @{"The menu bar" link MENUBAR}
		o @{"Selection area" link SELECTION}
		o @{"Map display area" link MAPDISPLAY}

@ENDNODE USAGE

@NODE MENUBAR "The menu bar"
  The menu bar is a standard Amiga menu strip that gives you access to most
of the options available inside the program.

@ENDNODE MENUBAR

@NODE SELECTION "The selection area"
The Selection area has a few gadgets that allow you to control the @{"shapes" link SHAPES}
and @{"groups" link GROUPS}, these are:

		o @{"SHAPE" link SHAPEWINDOW} : clicking on this gadget brings up the shape 
			  selection window
			  The shape selection window can also be brought
			  up by pressing [SPACE]
		o @{"GROUP" link GROUPWINDOW} : clicking on this gadget brings up the group
			  selection/creation/deletion widow
		o S     : click on this gadget and then click in the map
			  area to select a drawing shape from the map
		o <     : this gadget changes the current drawing shape to
                          the previous shape
			  If you're drawing with a group then this button
			  will switch back to shape drawing mode
		o >     : this gadget changes the current drawing shape to
			  the next shape.
			  If you're drawing with a group then this button
			  will switch back to shape drawing mode


@ENDNODE SELECTION

@NODE MAPDISPLAY "The map display..."
  The map display area is for actually drawing your map.  When you move the
mouse into this area the menus are disabled (as are their keyboard
shortcuts).  As you move around the area you will see that the current
drawing shape or @{"group" link GROUPS} is drawn at the block coordinates under the mouse
pointer.  Pressing the left mouse button will draw with the current shape
or group whilst pressing the right mouse button will delete the map
position under the mouse pointer.  Note that when using groups, using the
right mouse button will cause all map positions that lie under any shape in
the group to be cleared.  Another thing to note about groups is that when
you draw with a group that is positioned partly off screen but still inside
the actual map area, all the blocks will be drawn onto the map area.  This
means that the map off screen will be altered.

  If your map is larger than the current screen then you can use the cursor
keys to scroll it around.  In the right of the @{"Selection area" link SELECTION} is shown the
current coordinates in the map of the top left corner of the map display
area.

@ENDNODE MAPDISPLAY

@NODE SHAPEWINDOW "The shape selection window"
  This window lets you select the shape you wish to draw with.  The shape appear
in the centre of the window, uses the gadgets either side to cycle through
all the shapes in memory.

  Click on select to exit this window and go into block drawing mode.

  Note: This window 'remembers' its last position, so moving in to a convenient
place is possible.  It always reopens at its last coordinates.
@ENDNODE SHAPEWINDOW

@NODE GROUPS "About the groups..."
  Groups are a convenient way of pasting down several blocks at a time.  They
are made up of upto 35 different shapes.
@ENDNODE GROUPS

@NODE GROUPWINDOW "The GROUP window..."
  This window gives you access to group @{"creation" link CREATEGROUPS} functions available
inside the RI Map Editor.

  In the centre of the window will be a boxed area showing the current
selected group.  Directly below this area will be an information line for
the current group, giving group number (0-63) and the number of blocks inside
the group (upto 35).

  To the left and right of the boxed area are gadgets to cycle through the
groups.  The top two gadgets (<---, --->) cycle one group at a time whilst the
bottom two (<<<, >>>) cycle 10 groups at a time.  On the left of the window are
two gadgets for flipping the groups vertically and horizontally, clicking on
them will perform the flips about the centre of the current group.

  At the bottom of the window there are three buttons:
	
		o @{"CREATE" link CREATEGROUPS}
		o SELECT
		o DELETE

  Create will delete the current group and give you a chance to define a new
group in the current group number.
  Select will exit the window and return you to the main display.  If the
current group number is defined then Select will set the drawing mode to group
mode and will use this group.  If the group is undefined then drawing mode will
stay as block.
  Delete will erase the current groups information.

@ENDNODE GROUPWINDOW

@NODE CREATEGROUPS "Creating groups..."
Creating Groups
---------------

  To start creating a group you should click on the CREATE gadget from
inside the @{"GROUPS Window" link GROUPWINDOW}.  The window will disappear, leaving you with the
map display area.  Now just click on the blocks you wish to add to a group
and their block number of relative position will be stored.  When you click
on a block, and it is successfully added to the group, it will turn light
blue.  You may click on upto 35 blocks, at which point block defining will
automatically end.  Press the right mouse button to end creating before you
reach the 35 block limit.
  After creating your group you will be returned to the GROUP window.

@ENDNODE CREATEGROUPS

@NODE LOADSHAPES "The load shapes window"
  When you've selected a shapes file to load from the file requester you'll
be presented with a window giving you some load options, these are:

	o Reject smaller size - if on this causes all shapes that are
				smaller than the block size to be
			        cleared.
					
	o Reset handle - if on, this causes all shapes to have their
			 handles reset to 0,0.  Note: If you have a
			 shape that DOESN'T have its handle set to
			 0,0 and you try and draw with it you will
			 probably crash the program!  You have been
			 warned.

	o Overwrite current shapes
		       - if on, this option will cause the selected
			 shape file to be loaded at shape number 0
			 else it is loaded after all currently defined
			 shapes.

	o Quiet mode   - normally, when sorting the loaded shapes you
			 are shown a progress bar, selecting this
			 option removes this and speeds up the
			 process.
@ENDNODE LOADSHAPES

@NODE LOADAMAP "Loading a map..."
Loading A Map
-------------

  RI Map Editor can load two different map file formats:

	@{"Blitz2 Maps" link MAPFILEFORMAT}: these must be accompanied by the relevant .MAPSTUFF
		     file if you wish to load them in.
	@{"RI Maps" link MAPFILEFORMAT}    : these are map files that have all relevant information
		     stored inside them.

  When you select a map for loading, Map Editor will attempt to establish
what time of map the file is.  If it finds the header "RIMP" at the start
of the file then it will assumed it is a custom map, otherwise it will
assume that it is a Blitz2 map and look for a .MAPSTUFF file.  If it
doesn't find the .MAPSTUFF file it will reject the load request of a Blitz2
map.

  When loading a custom map, and depending on whether or not they were
saved with the map, you will be given the option to load both palette and
groups from the map file.

@ENDNODE LOADAMAP

@NODE SAVEAMAP "Saving a map..."
Saving A Map
------------

  You can only save maps in either the @{"custom format" link MAPFILEFORMAT} or as @{"raw" link MAPFILEFORMAT}.

  NOTE: If you save as @{"raw" link MAPFILEFORMAT} you will not be able to reload the map into RI
  MapEditor.

  If you save in the @{"custom format" link MAPFILEFORMAT} a window will open giving you some save
options.  At the moment there are only two options:

		o Save palette - saves the current palette (if you've
                                 loaded one in)
		o Save current groups - save all DEFINED @{"groups" link GROUPS} with the
		                        map

@ENDNODE SAVEAMAP

@NODE MAPFILEFORMAT "Map File Formats..."
RI MAP FILE FORMAT
==================

		+0.l		"RIMP" 		;File identifier
		+4.w		block width	;pixels
		+6.w		block height	;pixels
		+8.w		map width	;in blocks
		+10.w		map height	;in blocks

	Map chunks follow in the following order (if present in map file):

Palette:
		+0.l		"CMAP"		;Chunk identifier
		+4.l		size of chunk	;bytes (SAME AS IFF ILBM)
		+8,9,10.b	r,g,b		;values for colour 0
		+11,12,13.b	r,g,b		;values for colour 1
		etc.... for all colours

Groups:
		+0.l		"GRPS"		;Chunk identifier
		+4.l		number of groups

		for each group:
			+0.w number of blocks
			+2,+4,+6.w block 1,deltax,deltay,block number
			+2,+4,+6.w block 2,deltax,deltay,block number

Map Data:
		+0.l		"MAPD"		;Chunk identifier
		+4.l		length of data	;bytes
		+????		data stored one row at a time

 		Each map position has a word value assigned to it which
gives the block number at that square in the map.  0=no block in map
position, 1 is therefore the first block number available for use.

Raw files
=========

  These files are simply raw data saved out.  They have the same format as
the MAPD (Map data) chunk but do not have either the identifier or the
length.  Only raw map data is stored in this file.
