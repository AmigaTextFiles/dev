        TransferAnim.mcc documentation

TransferAnim.mcc is a MUI customclass intended to display transfer
(or busy) animations as known from browsers. 

This release also has very limited documentation.
Developers will get most out of reading the autodocs and included
example.

MUI is copyright Stefan Stuntz.
Thanks to Allan Odgaard for putting up with my questions.
Thanks to Kai Hofmann for the installerscript and suggestions.
The icons are taken from MUI's main archive.


  Why

Having a few different ongoing projects, I realized that it was a
specific piece of code I reused in almost all of them (the mui ones, 
anyway).
And this was the code to display datatypesobjects and transferanimations.
So I decided to make this a customclass for easier integration in
my own programs and to allow others to easily implement similar
objects in their projects, without too much effort.


  Requirements

This first release of TransferAnim.mcc uses datatypes to load
images and it also uses some other 39+ graphics calls, thus it
will only work on 3.x+ machines.


  Installation

Thanx to Kai Hofmann, the customclass comes with an installerscript,
without his work on MCC-Install, this would not be true.

So, for easy installation, just doubleclick the install icon and en-
joy yourself as you loose some hd space. 
The images needs not to be installed, they are only there for the
supplied demo.
However, if you don't install the images, the demo will look pretty
lousy unless you run it directly from the unarchived directory.

If you wish to install the class manually for some reason, just copy

    libs/mui/#? to mui:libs/mui/
    images/#? to mui:images/
    demos/#? to mui:demos/

and if you wish to use the developerfiles, just copy them from
developers/ to your prefered autodoc and includes directories.


   Todo

The class has the basic features I require for my own programs,
but if you have requests for me to implement other functions,
please suggest these to me!

  
	Author

Use it at your won risk!


  Usage

The only things the enduser needs to worry about is installing the
class correctly and the mui prefs.

If you wish, you can change the mui prefs to your preffered settings.

Currently there are two options to change.

    ° Default animation
        This animation is used whenever the animation specified by
        the program was not loadable for some reaso, maybe  because
        the file was not found.

    ° Default precision.
        Here you can specify with what precision you want the ani-
        mations remapped.

    ° Play mode
        Specify how you want the animations to play, choices are
        play always, play when window's active or never play.


   Developers

Developers who wish to use my class in their programs are totally free
to do so. However, I'd wish to be notified about it, and I wouldnt mind
a free copy of your program if you are charging money for it. This is not 
mandatory, however.

I also wouldnt mind being mentioned in the about requester or the docu-
mentation for the program.
