	 Many thanks to

     Timm S. Müller
      - Timm wrote mysticview.library, all I have done is put it in a
        MUI wrapper. Timm did all the hard work. Thanks Timm for a great
        library.

  	 Paul Huxham
    	 - For his expertise and incredible knowledge of the Amiga platform.

     Stefan Stuntz
