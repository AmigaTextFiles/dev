@NODE Description
@TITLE "1.1 Description"

1.1 Description
    -----------

  GenCodeM2  generates  Modula-"-Interfaces  out of User-Interfaces created
using the @{"MUIBuilder" LINK MUIBuilder}.

  The generated Modules are appropriate for using with the M2Amiga-Compiler
of  A+L-AG  only,  because it uses some special abilities of this Compiler,
other  don't  have  got.   The Modules are Amiga-specific and not usable on
other Computer-Systems.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Requirements
@TITLE "1.2 Requirements"

1.2 Requirements
    ------------

  You have to have the following Stuff to use GernCodeM2.

o  MUIBuilder  Version  2.00  or higher, and also all the Stuff you need to
work with MUIBuilder, too (see Documentation for MUIBuilder).

o  AmigaOS 2.0 or higher


@ENDNODE

@NODE Installation
@TITLE "2.1 Installation"

2.1 Installation
    ------------

  The Installation of GenCodeM2 is really easy.  Simply copy the program to
the Directory "Modules" you can find in the MUIBuilder-Directory, where you
also can find all the other Code-Generators like GenCodeC.
  There, and only there will MUIBuilder find the M2-Code-Generator.

IMPORTANT:

  You  need  to  install  the M2-Interface-Modules for MUI distributed as a
part of this package.  The original ones of Christian Scholz do not support
all the features MUIBuilder uses!!


@ENDNODE

@NODE Usage
@TITLE "2.2 Usage"

2.2 Usage
    -----

  If  GenCodeM2  is installed correctly, you can choose the Generator using
the  Preferences  of  MUIBuilder (Menu Prefs).  For creating Modula2-Source
you  should  choose  M2  now, which will activate GenCodeM2 when generating
SourceCode next time.

  On  generation  of  M2-Modules  you  should  take care on the name of the
created  Module  containing  only  allowed  characters corresponding to the
M2-Rules.  Elsewise the compiler might not translate the Module.  Unallowed
characters in Objectnames will automatically be replaced with an underline.
  The  Modulenames  will be extended by GenCodeM2 to "Mui.Mod" respectively
"Mui.Def".   For  example,  if the project is called "MUIBDemo" the Modules
"MUIBDemoMui.Def" and "MUIBDemoMui.Mod" will be created.

  If  you  create  localized Sourcecode, you have to have the corresponding
Strings in a Module with the Ending Locale.  In our project "MUIBDemo" this
would   be   "MUIBDemoLocale".    So   you   have   to   have  the  Modules
"MUIBDemoLocale.Def"  and "MUIBDemoLocale.Mod", which contains, besides the
locale-strings,  the  function,  which  gives back the Address of a string.
The  Name  of  this  function  has  to be defined in the GetString-Field in
MUIBuilder.

  Similar to the Locale-Strings you have to have Modules for using Hooks.
These Modules have to have the ending "Hook", i.e. for our example:
"MUIBDemoHook.Def" and "MUIBDemoHook.Mod"

@TITLE "3.1 Copyright"

3.1 Copyright
    ---------

  GenCodeM2  is  MAILWARE,  i.e.,  if  you  want  to use this program after
testing it for a few days, you have to send me a message.  This message can
be  a  normal  letter (snail-mail), a postcard or electronic mail (e-mail).
If you want to note something to the program, please do, the future of this
program  depends on replies.  I will try to answer as fast as possible, but
remember  I'm no software-house, so I have to keep my costs low and I don't
spend all my time on it.  :o)
  My @{"Address" LINK Support} can be found at the end of this documentation.

@NODE Updates
@TITLE "4.3 Updates"

4.3 Updates
    -------

  The  latest  Version  of GenCodeM2 you can find on aminet.  If a PD-Serie
includes  it (and tells me) you can also get it there.  If there's no other
possibility you can get it from me too, whereby I want to have no costs, of
course.  So, if you want me to send it to you, send me an EMPTY floppy-disk
AND the money to send it back to you.
  It should also be inside the MUIBuilder-Archive itself :o)
