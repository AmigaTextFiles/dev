Short:        code generators for MUIBuilder
Uploader:     mrustler@gmx.de (Matthias Rustler)
Author:       Eric Totel
Type:         dev/mui
Version:      2.2
Architecture: m68k-amigaos

This archive contains the code generators from the old 2.2 release of MUIBuilder.
I had overwritten version 2.2 when had uploaded version 2.3, but the code generators
should still work with the new version. I have removed GenCodeC and GenCodeGCC
because the new release of MUIBuilder contains an improved version of the C
code generator.

Installation:
Copy the content of Modules to <MUIBuilder>/Modules
