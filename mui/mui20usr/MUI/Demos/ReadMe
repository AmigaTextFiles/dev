Important: If MUI isn't yet installed on your system, please start
           the script "StartMeFirst" first. This will help the
           demo programs in finding all needed classes and libraries.


You should start the MUI preferences program ("Prefs/MUI")
simultaneously and play around with all configuration options.
This way, you will easily find out what MUI has to offer.


For programmers: Every demo comes with complete source code,
                 located somewhere in the Developers drawer.


Much fun, Stefan
