What the hell is DFView?
========================

`DFView' is *not* just a viewer. It is a bit less and a bit more than
this.

`DFView' allows you to handle file lists in quite a comfortable way. It
allows you to configure an *external* program. `DFView' processes the
files within the filelist and processes them calling the external
program.

`DFView' was programmed using `MUI' ((C) Stefan Stuntz). This means
1st. that you need `MUI' to run this program!  As `MUI' needs at least
*AMIGA*OS V2.04 (V37.175), you must have this OS installed!

`DFView' is using `MUI'.  You not only get an application icon, the
typical 2.0 look and feel but better, you can do all operations by
keyboard!  `DFView' is a commodity, so you can pop it up by holding
down the "hotkey".  There is LOCALE-Support as well.  Notice that you
*need* *AMIGA*OS V2.1 or V3.0 (or even better) to take advantage of
this feature.  If you are still using V2.0x, `DFView' takes the english
texts.

History
=======

In spring 1993 I got to know the MagicUserInterface ((C) 1993, Stefan
Stuntz). I liked it at once and soon time after I decided to program a
"little" tool to learn how `MUI' works (learning by doing).

The weeks and months have passed and the "little" tool `DFView' became
bigger and bigger. I tried to implement as many features (e.g.  Locale
support) as possible, to see if `MUI' is suitable for larger projects
as well. And voila - I think, `DFView' became quite a useful piece of
software.

Installation
************

   *  Please install `MUI' to your harddisk. `DFView' does *not* work
     without `MUI'.

   *  Copy the `DFView' executable and its `.info' file to a drawer in
     your search path. If you copy it to the `WBStartup' drawer, it
     will be started automatically during booting.

   *  Copy the catalog file(s) (locale/<language>/DFView.catalog) to
     Locale:Catalogs/<language>. Please notice that you get locale
     support only, if you already upgraded to Workbench 2.1 or above.

   *  Copy the documentation files (`DFView.dvi', `DFView.guide',
     `DFView.doc') to any destination that suits your needs. Please
     notice that the `DFView.guide' has to be in the proper drawer to
     be found by `MUI's online help system. Please read the `MUI'
     documentation for details.

Well - that's it.  Now you can use either the shell to start `DFView'
manually by typing `DFView' or `run DFView >NIL: <NIL:', or you double
click on it from the Workbench.

As mentioned above, if you copied `DFView' to the `WBStartup' drawer it
will start automatically while booting.

Quick Start
***********

When `DFView' comes up the first time, it opens its window and you can
immediately use it.  If you don't want `DFView' to open its window
every time it starts up you have to change the preferences as described
in the `MUI' documentation.  The application icon will appear on the
Workbench as long as you don't switch it off in the `MUI-Prefs' program.

As `DFView' tries to follow the "User Interface Style Guide" as tight
as possible, it should be no problem (at least for advanced users) to
figure out all the functions of `DFView' according to "trial and
error".  If you don't want to get bad (?) surprises, just continue
reading...

Settings
********

There are two possibilities to configure `DFView':  First you can change
many attributes via the `MUI-Prefs' program and second you can use the
built-in `DFView' preferences. You need both ways for a complete
configuration! Please notice that you need a registred version of `MUI'
to *save* all its settings.

There exist three kinds of processing the *selected* files. They can be
processed `one by one', which means that the command (see above) is
called for *every* selected file. Only this file is given to the
command.

If you select `all at once', all selected items in the file list are
given to the command. If there are more files selected than the
internal limit allows, only as many files are processed as are
possible. The other files are *not* used.

`All until done' tries to give you a workaround for the internal
command size limit mentioned above. It processes as many commands as
possible. When processing these files is finished, it continues with
the remaining.

Miscellaneous
*************

   * *`DFView' is fontsensitiv*

     `DFView' adapts itself completely to the fonts you selected in the
     font preferences program of the Workbench! This means that the
     window will become bigger, if you select a font larger than 8
     points!  If the window becomes too large to fit into the screen,
     `DFView' falls back to a smaller font.

     Please notice that you can change the fonts used by `DFView' via
     the `MUI-Prefs' additionally.

   * *Window Positions*

     `DFView' remembers the positions of all its windows.  This means
     that the windows reopen on the same place you closed them!  Saving
     of the window positions takes place if you save the settings of the
     `MUI-Prefs'.

If you have any suggestions, bug reports, too much money, you can reach
me via:

Home address:
     Dirk Federlein

     Brunnengasse 11a

     63741 Aschaffenburg

     Germany


Study address:
     Dirk Federlein

     FIDO: 2:242/14.26


E-mail reaches me always, no matter to which of the above addresses you
write, because netmail is rerouted automatically.  If you prefer to
send "normal" mail to Würzburg during the holidays, it may last quite
a long time until you'll get an answer because during the holidays I'm
not in Würzburg quite often.  If you don't know to which address you
should write, just send the letter to Aschaffenburg, in which case it
will reach me surely.

*I hope you'll enjoy using DFView*
