MUI  is  an object oriented system to create and maintain graphical user
interfaces.  From  a programmers point of view, using MUI saves a lot of
time  and  makes life much easier. Thinking about complicated terms like
window resizing or font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.

On  the  other hand, users of MUI based applications have the ability to
customize  nearly every pixel of a programs interface according to their
personal taste.

This distribution is interesting for both, users and programmers. Please
have  a  look  at the supplied demo programs and at the documentation to
see what MUI has to offer.
