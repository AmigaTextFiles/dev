        This file describes all changes since version 1.0 of MUI

************************************************************************



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0  (08-Aug-93)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Initial Release.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1  (15-Aug-93)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Removed a remaining serial debug output.

- Corrected installation script for 2.x systems.

- Corrected HELP: assign of "StartMeFirst" script.

- Corrected some autodocs and header file bugs.

- Added system configuration switch to adjust window refresh
  type, possibilities are simple refresh and smart refresh.

- Made some changes to the Oberon interface.

- String gadgets with an invisible font ate some bytes of memory.

- Fixed some bugs with failing boopsi images.

- Some minor changes to some of the demo programs.

- Speeded object creation about 10%.

- For boopsi image implementors: boopsi images now have the ability
  to specify a desired minimum and maximum size. See "mui.h"
  for details.

- Implemented MUIA_Window_DefaultObject attribute. See autodocs
  for details.

- Added some new boopsi images.

- Implemented MUIA_ControlChar for radio buttons. Pressing
  the control char will activate the next (shift -> previous)
  radio button element.

- Implemented MUIA_ControlChar for string gadgets. Pressing
  the control char will activate the gadget.

- Added some more keyboard shortcuts to the prefs program.

- Minimum width for MUIA_Window_SizeRight windows was calculated wrong.

- Last characters of some text fields were not displayed with
  certain fonts.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2  (28-Aug-93)                      (Amiga Meeting, Bielefeld)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixed enforcer hits in ARexx HELP command.

- Setting MUIA_Background did not refresh the display.

- Added validity check on key description strings in prefs program.

- Initializing string or prop gadgets with MUIA_Disabled didn't really
  disable the gadget.

- Fixed some sync problems with MUIA_String_Integer.

- Menu checkmarks would disappear when a window was closed and reopened.

- Specifying a non existing font caused windows to disappear.

- Included Manx, Assembler, Modula, Oberon and Amiga-E interfaces.

- Implemented MUIA_Window_Screen attribute. This allows opening a
  MUI window on an explicitly defined intuition screen.

- Rewrote the image caching mechanism. This should fix some bugs
  and system crashes with non existing external image files.

- Fixed a bad bug that could trash the stack under certain
  circumstances.

- MUIA_Selected didn't work at object creation time.

- Better MOUSEMOVE and INTUITICKS handling to improve performance.

- Using simple refresh windows would sometimes freeze the system.

- Attention... very powerful feature... :-)
  Implemented two new attributes for group class:
  MUIA_Group_PageMode   (TRUE/FALSE)      this group is a page group.
  MUIA_Group_ActivePage (0...numchilds-1) this child shall be displayed.
  Page groups always show exactly one of their childs. The number of
  this child can be changed dynamically, even in an open window.
  New demo "Pages" demonstrates the new page groups.

- Included AppWindow support. See MUIA_Window_AppWindow,
  MUIA_Application_DropObject and MUIA_AppMessage for details.
  New demo "AppWindow" for demonstration.

- Bumped version number of all libs to 5. You must not mix MUI
  classes and libraries with different version numbers, this
  will lead into problems. Revision numbers are uncritical.
  Note: This does not affect applications. They will of course
  work with all MUI releases, as long as all version numbers
  are identical.

- Included version number checking. MUI will refuse to open
  classes when the class version doesn't match the master
  library. Note: when I'm sure about internal class communication
  (maybe in a few months...), this check will become obsolete.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3  (29-Aug-93)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- MUIA_String_Secret string gadgets crashed on an 68000.

- Corrected assembler includes.

- Fixed bug with MUIA_Window_ActiveObject.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4  (27-Oct-93)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

From V1.4 on, MUI is distributed in two separate archives:
  muiXXusr.lha - libraries, classes, demos, user documentation.
  muiXXdev.lha - programmer interfaces and programmer documentation.


Changes for users:

- Important Note:
  Due to some enhancements in image processing, registered users will
  have to readjust their image settings. Otherwise some images might
  not be visible!

- I accept every currency for registration now. Please read the
  registration section of the manual for details.

- Rearranged preferences program. Instead of many different windows,
  page groups are used and should make things a lot easier.

- Implemented palette gadget for public screens.

- Added the possibility to use an RGB color as image (V39 and above).

- Implemented background pattern for screens (V39 and above).

- Background pictures allocate their colors correctly (V39 and above).

- Gauge frame and radio button spacing didn't work.

- Reduced flicker when resizing a window with a fancy background.

- Added configuration switch for window redraw type. Possible settings
  are fast/ugly and slow/nice. Defaults to fast/ugly, which isn't really
  really ugly but maybe faster.

- Added special screen type to address the frontmost public screen.

- Speeded up first drawing of a window.

- Fixed some simple refresh problems with page groups.

- Iconify Gadget wasn't visible on a one plane display.

- Improved text rendering speed about 20% (maybe even more if you have
  some data cache).

- Made cycle popups blazingly fast and more configurable (frame setting).

- One gadget requesters can always be answered with the <Press> key.

- Two gadget requesters can always be answered with 'y' for the left
  and 'n' for the right gadget.

- Requester buttons sometimes were layouted with no intermediate
  spacing.

- Scrolling a partially obscured listview in a simple refresh window
  would create some pixel garbage.

- Reasonably speeded up listview drawing, cursor handling and multi
  selecting. Together with keyboard scrolling, display is even faster
  if a listview's height is exactly a multiple of its line height.

- Implemented configuration switch for full line listviews. These
  listviews won't show incomplete lines are and are somewhat
  faster. Default are full line listviews.

- Fixed some public screen open and close problems.

- Tab size in floattext class was handled wrong.

- Eliminated first and last line flicker when scrolling listviews.

- Rearranged and rewrote parts of the documentation.

- Please read the manuals "Discussion" section before reporting
  any problems!


Changes for programmers:

- Attention... very powerful feature... :-)
  Implemented virtual (scrolling) groups. Included new program
  "Virtual" for demonstration.

- New color oriented classes: Colorfield, Coloradjust, Palette.

- Fixed vertical slider problem.

- Trying to create an object from a non existing class caused an
  enforcer hit.

- Enabling a group containing prop/string gadgets didn't really enable
  the gadgets.

- Implemented MUIM_WriteString and MUIM_WriteLong methods for easy
  structure updating.

- Implemented MUIA_ControlChar for slider objects.

- MUIA_Group_ActivePage didn't trigger notification.

- Fixed some minor text engine bugs.

- During the execution of a MUIM_CallHook in a notify method,
  other MUI tasks were locked.

- Implemented MUIA_Version and MUIA_Revision attributes to allow
  version checking for applications.

- The number of the current entry is passed to a list display
  hook as additional parameter.

- Setting a boopsi gadgets attributes didn't cause a display update.

- Setting MUIA_Background wouldn't always update the display.

- Children of MUIA_Group_SameXXXX groups could accidently be enlarged
  beyond their maximum size.

- Implemented MUIA_Application_BrokerPri attribute.

- Implemented MUIA_Application_BrokerPort attribute. This port can
  e.g. be used to add additional HotKeys with the HotKey() amiga.lib
  function.

- Recognizing a press/release of a prop gadget is possible by
  listening to the MUIA_Prop_Pressed attribute.

- Adding and removing members of groups could accidently change
  the groups orientation.

- Implemented some new standard images concerning tape deck and network
  issues.

- MUIM_Application_Get/SetMenuCheck didn't work.

- Some Modula and Oberon interface changes.

- Implemented MUIA_Slider_Quiet tag to hide the number output.

- Implemented MUIA_Dirlist_MultiSelFiles attribute.

- Implemented MUIA_Window_PublicScreen tag to force opening windows
  on certain public screens.

- Implemented MUIM_List_NextSelected to help stepping through selected
  entries of a list.

- Implemented MUIA_List_Title attribute to support titles for
  (multi columned) lists.

- MUIA_List_Active wasn't reported during a MUIM_List_Clear.

- MUIA_List_Active was reported twice during a MUIM_List_Remove.

- MUIA_Boopsi_Object didn't trigger notification.

- Implemented default sizes for all classes. New windows will
  be opened using these default sizes instead of
  MUIV_Window_Width/Height_MinMax(10).

- Menu multi select didn't work.

- Autodocs are alphabetically sorted now.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0  (11-Feb-94)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes for users:

- Rearranged libraries. Classes which are needed by all applications or
  which are very small are integrated in muimaster.library. Fancy and
  rarely used classes come as external files. This speeds up starting
  the first MUI application and simplifies installation procedure for
  commercial applications.

- Integration of classes increases performance significantly.

- Rearranged the prefs program completely. Major changes include
  "single application" mode, image multiselect, presets and localization.
  I cannot list all the other news here in detail, but together they should
  make adjusting preferences a lot easier.

- Included beautiful new 8 color images, patterns and button designs from
  Martin "MagicWB" Huttenloher. Give them a try!

- Fixed several screenmode requester bugs.

- Fixed problems with crazy going prop gadgets.

- Changed "active object" display. No more ugly active background but
  instead a nice extra frame will be displayed.

- Getting the name of the used public screen is possible with
  new ARexx command "info screen".

- Documented ARexx command error result codes.


Changes for programmers:

- More detailed developer documentation including information about
  writing custom classes and a MUI style guide. Read it!

- Included new demos "Class<n>" to show how to implement custom
  classes.

- Added the ability to specify a listview multiselect type directly.
  See MUIA_Listview_MultiSelect attribute for details.

- The MUIA_ShowMe attribute can be used to hide objects. Using this
  attribute is even possible in open windows, hiding object will
  then cause a new layout to take place. When necessary, the parent
  window will be resized automatically. Included new demo program
  "ShowHide".

- Implemented popstring, popasl, popobject classes for asynchronous
  popups. popasl class is the recommended way to include file/font/etc.
  requesters. Included new demo program "Popup" to demonstrate the new
  popup classes.

- Added a register class. No, this is not for registrating your MUI,
  its used to create flexible titled page groups. See the prefs
  program and the pages demo for details.

- Added the ability to specify a listview multiselect type directly.
  See MUIA_Listview_MultiSelect attribute for details.

- Implemented MUIM_List_InsertSingle method.

- Multiline entries ("foo\nbar") in a cycle gadget were not handled
  correctly.

- Implemented MUIA_Rectangle_HBar and MUIA_Rectangle_VBar to create
  nice single border lines.

- Implemented MUIM_MultiSet method, MUIA_NoNotify attribute and
  MUIM_KillNotify method for notify class.

- Implemented MUIA_Gauge_InfoText attribute.

- Implemented MUIA_Listview_ClickColumn, MUIA_Listview_DefClickColumn.

- Fixed problem with MUIA_Application_Iconified notification.

- Implemented MUIV_List_Select_All for MUIM_List_Select method.

- Fixed some problems with sleeping windows and applications.

- MUIA_List_First and MUIA_List_Visible are really get()able.

- Fixed a problem with keyboard control for MUIA_Slider_Quiet sliders,
  implemented MUIA_Slider_Reverse tag.

- Tag value and documentation for MUIA_List_Title attribute was
  missing.

- Specifying images with "1:<x>" never worked, use "6:<x>" instead.
  See MUIA_Image_Spec for details.

- MUI_Request() gadgets may contain '_' characters to indicate keyboard
  shortcuts.

- Implemented MUIA_Application_RexxHook.

- Implemented MUIA_String_EditHook.
