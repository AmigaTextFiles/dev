 HISTORY
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
As  noone develops SAS/C anymore and many start using StormC (as I) some
might  get fustrated by the fact that their programs need a bit tweeking
to  get  it to compile under StormC. When I first wanted to learn how to
code  MUI  stuff  I started compiling the sourcecodes that came with the
MUI developer package. They didn't compile and I hadn't the knowledge to
make the compile either...

 PRESENT
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
...Now I have and has therefor made changes to them to make them compile
under StormC. All my changes are marked with /*FR* Comment */. I haven't
modified  the  psi files. There were too many failures and I didn't have
time to fix them.

 FUTURE
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I  maybe  will  fix  psi too some day. If you Storm users out there find
anything  in  the MUI include-files that Storm won't compile please send
me  a mail telling me where or even better: Fix the file (as I have done
in  these,  making them compile both by SAS/C and StormC) and send it to
me and I will include it in the next version of this package.

 NOTE
¯¯¯¯¯¯
I have nothing to do with the official MUI-development(??) team. This is
a  separate  package  made  for  the  benefit  of  the  Amiga  community
(especially  those  of you using StormC, want to learn MUI and get stuck
because the demos wont compile).
