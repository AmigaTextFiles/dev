    NAME
	TableGroup -- ... (V1 )

    FUNCTION
	TableGroup is a Custom Class of the Magic User Interface © by
	Stefan Stuntz.
	It's a subclass of group-class and uses the MUIA_Group_LayoutHook
	to do advanced row/column group layout.

	The motivation for this class was the wish that several super classes
	of an (not necessarily MUI) object can add their GUI objects
	to one group which generates a uniform look although different numbers
	of columns occur. But you may find this useful for much more usages.

	A table consists of a number of rows, columns and cells. The cells
	are containers for area objects, they may keep empty.  As in
	all MUI groups using the same object multiple times is
	forbidden.  Cells are addressed via their coordinates.

	The MUIA_Group_Child tag is also used for TableGroups,
	unlike normal MUI groups you are allowed to add new objects
	later with the Set method and this tag or with AddMember.

    NOTES
	None at the moment.

    BUGS
	 If TableGroup calls OpenLibrary during its LibInit procedure and
	causes loading muimaster.library from disk, it hangs while this
	OpenLibrary call.  SnoopDos tells that the muimaster.library's
	init func waits when it tries to open screennotify.library (no
	difference if installed or not).  This error occurs if you
	directly load the TableGroup.mcc with LoadLibrary or a self
	written program which simply does CloseLibrary (OpenLibrary
	("TableGroup.mcc", 0)).  If you run a program that uses TableGroup
	this error should not occur, since your program will open
	muimaster.library by itself before.
	 To find out more about this error I removed some critical parts
	of the LibInit function for tests:  If I remove the installation
	of a private stack (20kB), the machine crashes earlier than
	before, namely when muimaster.library tries to open
	muigfx.library.  With this private stack muimaster hangs (it seems
	that ramlib is blocked) when loading screennotify.  At this time
	1200 bytes of the ramlib stack are used.  In earlier versions of
	TableGroup.mcc only a7 was modified, now StackSwap is used for
	this purpose, but this does not solve the problem.  Also adjusting
	stack information of the process structure (and not only of task
	structure) to prevent stack check errors does not help.  I
	included two versions of MCCTableGroup:  TableGroup.mcc works on a
	private stack while its LibInit function,
	TableGroupRamLibStack.mcc does not touch the stack location given
	from ramlib.  But it is not clear if the stack is the cause of the
	described bug.
	 There is also an exception handler (neither Exec nor MC68000
	exceptions, but the exceptions supported by my programming
	language Cluster) that could be the reason for all the trouble.
	But removing it does not change anything.  This exception handler
	temporary modifies the TrapData field of the calling task (in case
	of LibInit the ramlib process).
	 Take into account that the LibInit function works fine if run in
	a debugger's context (in my case Disect).  Please help, I can not
	release this MCC before this bug is fixed!
		
	Group class (current muimaster version 19) seems not to care about
	its MUIA_Group_(Horiz|Vert)Spacing values when used with a layout
	hook. To get the user settings for spacing though, TableGroup
	creates a normal group object as child of itself to ask it for the
	default values. That's why you should be prepared to find objects in
	the MUIA_Group_ChildList you have not added by yourself. Do not
	assume in which position and number foreign objects appear in this
	list. If you want to delete all childs of a table group better
	remove them with MUIM_TableGroup_Remove.

    FUNCTION
	Skips specified number of rows. Negative numbers means

	MUIA_TableGroup_GrowsTo.  If the table grows to the right the column is
	changed if the beginning or the end of this column is reached. If the
	table grows downward the table will be extended if you cross the

TableGroup.mcc/MUIA_Group_Child

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_Child                  -- (V4 ) [ISG], Object *

    FUNCTION
	Adds a child to the table and skips to the next cell.

	Table groups allow to add child objects in a SetAttrs call, too.
	You can mix MUIA_Group_Child with other statements (e.g.  for
	merging cells), which makes it more comfortable than switching
	between AddMember and SetAttrs calls.

	Objects that can not be added because of memory deficiency are
	simply disposed since it is to difficult to keep track what SetAttrs
	has done within the current call.  SetAttrs has no return value, so
	you must ask for errors after a SetAttrs call which contains
	statements that can extend a table.  You can do this by notifying or
	getting the MUIA_TableGroup_Error attribute.  It is possible to do
	multiple SetAttrs before asking for errors.  You will then get the
	last error which occured.

	Never forget:  Objects added with MUIA_Group_Child are treated as
	they would be created just for this group.  Removing objects from
	one group and adding it to a table group, will lead to trouble
	because the object is simply disposed when it cannot be added to the
	destination table group.  Better use AddMember in this case.

	With SetAttrs you know when an error occurs but you don't know which
	objects are affected, so simply MUIM_TableGroup_Remove all childs
	and clear all pointers to them. Otherwise you will get an incomplete
	GUI and invalid pointers.

	Setting MUIA_Group_Child will lead to trouble if some children are
	again table group's.  Be sure you have set the MUIA_Group_Forward
	tag to false (still undocumented in V19) then.

	Getting the MUIA_Group_Child attribute returns the object
	in the current cell.
