This class creates a group of GUI elements based on Readargs-compatible
template. That's the way AmigaMesaRTL output handlers show their parameters
and get user specified settings.

I hope it will be useful for someone. BTW it's the most compact GUI
representation in the world... :-)

    NAME
	MUIA_Readargsgroup_Key -- [I.G], char *

    FUNCTION
   You have to specify the template at init time. The string is copied into
   private buffer.
   Most of standard Readargs features are supported (/M,/K,/S,/N)
   Normal arguments are turned in string gadgets, /N's become integer
   gadgets, /S are shown as checkboxes.
   You can define abbreviations as usual (ABBR=ABBREVIATION).
   Moreover it has some extensions (compatible with the original):
   
    - underscores '_' in the argument's names are converted to spaces in
      GUI labels

    - special codes can be put in argument's names to create additional GUI
      elements:

      _LA_any_text - creates a label
      _LA1_any_text - a label with horizontal bar
         labels should be specified as keywords (/K) so they will not cause
         arguement strings to be longer

      _FN_argument - string gadget with filename popup 
      _FO_argument - ... with font popup (format: fontname/size) 
      _SM_argument - ... with screenmode popup (format: 0xHEXNUMBER)

      _MX_switch/S,_MX_secondswitch/S,...
        MX turns a set of checkboxes into mutual exclude radiobutton
        switches beginning with _MX1_ form the second radiobutton group
        _MX2_ - third and so on


     See AmigaMesaRTL output handlers sources for examples.

    BUGS
   Argument type /M is not fully supported. Only the first word is read
   in the gui. In filename requesters it should provide a multiselect
   capabilities but it doesn't... :-(

Readargsgroup.mcc/MUIA_Readargsgroup_Args

    NAME
	MUIA_Readargsgroup_Args -- [ISG], char *

    FUNCTION
   With this argument you can put values into GUI elements.
   Your argument string will be parsed by ReadArgs, of course.
   Getting MUIA_Readargsgroup_Args gives you the ReadArgs compatible string
   containing user specified values.
