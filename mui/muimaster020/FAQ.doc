Some of the more commonly asked questions I have received
in emails.

Q.I don't see much of a difference??

A. Lower end processor will benefit most by the changes
   to the library. 040's and 060's with their larger caches
   and improved execution times on many instructions bypass
   many of the inadequacies of plain 68000 code.

Q. What is actually speeded up?

A. All of the internal workings of muimaster.library.
   All of the MUI classes which are built into muimaster.library.

   Programs which make extensive use of internal '.mui' classes
   will benefit the most. 

Q  What about external MCC's?

A. Passing of methods and attributes to external classes from
   internal parent classes is marginally improved.

Q  Why didn't you bump the revision number?

A. This library only improves performance, it does not improve
   functionality, hence the revision no. will stay the same.
   MUI is also a commercial product (c) Stefan Stunz.
   My aim with this project is augment Stefan's fine work,
   by optimizing in a way that cannot be achieved when you are
   working with a C compiler.

Q. MUI doesn't handle icons with more than 8 colours. Can you
   fix it?

A. muimaster.library makes standard calls to the icon.library
   for access to it's 'APPicon' imagery. Presumably, if you
   are using a version of icon.library (3.5,3.9?) that handles
   icons with >8 colours, then MUI will also.

   I don't use icons with more than 8 colours so I must admit
   it is something I have no experience with.

   MUI does correctly render graphic images with more than 8 
   colours. There is NO mechanism (tell me if I'm wrong) in
   MUI to lock the workbench colours however. To have MUI
   correctly display graphics, you will need to use some
   external mechanism to lock the workbench coulurs, and ensure
   that all of your graphic images are created using the same
   matching palette.
   None of your GFX will appear correctly on other users machines
   unless they are using the same palette and colour locking
   mechanism though. 

Q. MUIPrefs3.8 GURUS on my machine after I iconify it then
   re-open the window. Can you fix it?

A. The MUIPrefs program that is in the 3.8 user archive has a
   memory 'leak' of 288 bytes each time it is run.
   If you iconify the window, then do an 'avail flush', the
   available chip memory increases somewhat.
   It appears to be a problem in the actual MUIPrefs program
   as opposed to the muimaster.library. None of the other
   MUI apps I have behave in this way after being iconified.

   A fix for the problem is not a priority at this point in time.

Q. Are you a registered MUI user?

A. Yes, I am.
