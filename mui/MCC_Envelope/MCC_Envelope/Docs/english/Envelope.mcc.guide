@node INTRO "MCC_Envelope/Introduction"

@{u}The MCC_Envelope Gadget@{uu}
This is a custom MUI gadget for editing envelopes as used by various 
MIDI synthesizers. 

Unfortunately, it is not as flexible as I would have liked. But I
haven't got unlimited time to work on this gadget so I decided to
release it as it is now.

@{b}Usage@{ub}
Simply click on one of the knobs and drag it around with the mouse. If
you click near the knob but outside the knob itself the knob will
move in steps of 1. This makes finetuning a lot easier.

@node REQ "MCC_Envelope/Requirements"
 · An Amiga!
 · Kickstart 2.0 or better.
 · MUI v3.8 or better. (Magic User Interface)
 · At least 1MB of RAM. More is recommended.

@node THANKS "MCC_Envelope/Thanks"

tedious testing.

Thanks to Stefan Stuntz for MUI.

..add your own ones here :)

@node HISTORY "MCC_Envelope/History"

 Program history - a description of each release. Note: I use
 Commodores (RIP) definition of version numbers. Ex. 1.10 is newer 
 than 1.5!

 In fact every time I make a change in the sourcecode and I compile
 this PlugIn the version number gets increased by one!

 I use the following 3 letter IDs to describe changes:

   FIX - Bug fix
   NEW - New feature
   CHG - Change in behaviour from previous versions

 @{u}History (Newest on top)@{uu}

  @{b}v14.1 - 1-Aug-1999@{ub}
    FIX - Fixed major bug with the callback system! Didn't call the 
          callback with pointer to the right data!
    FIX - Fixed a bug in the 'Future' section of the AmigaGuide

  @{b}v14.0 - 20-Jul-1999@{ub}
    First release.
