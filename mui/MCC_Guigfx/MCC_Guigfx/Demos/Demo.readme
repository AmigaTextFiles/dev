Notes on the NewImage demo:
	- Yup, the text object next to the slider looks silly. Didn't bother
	  to make it look as nice as in Stefan's "slidorama" :)
	- Transparency color is not yet implemented (gonna add a colorwheel)
	  Right now it stays set to the default of 0L
	- if trash appears when using transparency masks, you probably have an
     old version of guigfx.library. Get the latest one!
