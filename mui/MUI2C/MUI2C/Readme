MUI2C is a preprocessor that automates most of the tedious chores required of
a MUI custom class writer. It will automatically generate the following:

    o   IDs for all public methods and attributes
    o   Separate header files for public methods and attributes and private
        ones
    o   Class dispatcher and an initializer function
    o   Call to superclass for each method in the appropriate place
    o   Appropriate return statement(s) for each method
    o   Switch statement for each attribute in OM_GET and OM_SET methods, as
        well as the for loop in the OM_SET method

It also allows the programmer to disable generation of the last three for a
particular method in case it has special requirements not catered for by
MUI2C.

The archive includes the MUI2C executable compiled for 68000 with no math,
along with the complete sources and two example files. If you wish to
recompile MUI2C, you will need flex, which can be obtained from Aminet:

MUI2C is freeware. If you distribute it, please keep the archive intact. See
