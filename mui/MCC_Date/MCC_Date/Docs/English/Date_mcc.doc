Description
-----------

Date is an abstract Custom Class of the Magic User Interface © by Stefan Stuntz.
It's a subclass of notify-class and only usable for developers who want to
build subclasses of Date.mcc!

The idea of this class was born during developing my Gregor application.

MUI abstract public custom class allowing easy
handling of dates. Because it is abstract it is only usefull for developers
who are working with classes that are based on Date.mcc (like DateString.mcc),
or who want to build their own classes based on Date.mcc.

Date.mcc features:
- Handles years from 8 to 8000
- Supports the Gregorian calendar reform
- Supports MUIM_Import and MUIM_Export
- Supports drops of other date objects and date-strings
- A week can begin with any weekday
- The date can be read as day/month/year format or as JD or MJD
- The date range can be restricted
- Method to set the current date
- Methods for increasing and decreasing the date
- Method to compare with another date object



Requirements
------------

- MUI 3.1 (Version 12)
- date.library

- To use the Greek MCC-Install script you need the
  "Greek Workbench" © AC Software

- To use the Russian MCC-Install script you need
  "Rusifier" © Dmitry Mikhilov



Installation
------------

Please only install Date.mcc when you are a developer!

Use the installer script!
(The Installer must be in your system-path!)

If you use an Installer prior to V42 you should set the LANGUAGE Tooltype to
your language. Installer V42 and better automatically use your current locale.


Please note that the installer-script is very special, because:

- It features uninstallation
- It is automated
- It is very flexible
- It is very intelligent (for an installer-script ;-)
- It uses WrapGuide (if present) for the AmigaGuide®
  documentation if running under a pre V39 system.
- It can be reused by (hopefully) all other MUI custom classes, because the
  authors of custom classes need to only change a few things:

  * The #copyright variable
  * The #min_os_version and #min_os_revision variables
  * The #min_mui_version and #min_mui_revision variables
  * The #language_mcc and #language_mcp variables
  * The P_CustomExists, P_CustomInstall and P_CustomUninstall procedures
  * The 'APPNAME' tooltype within the MCC-Install icon.



Information for Developers
--------------------------

There is no multiple inheritance for Boopsi/MUI for the moment, so we haven't
any chance to create a real Date basis-class. But there is another way to have
the same result (compatibility for all classes that are dealing with date).
The solution is called interface inheritance like it was done with IDL for CORBA.
Interface inheritance has some advantages and some disadvantages.

The advantages are:
- (Pseudo) multiple inheritance
- The same interface for all classes dealing with Date

The disadvantages are:
- Every one who wants to subclass Date.mcc must include the code for Date.mcc
  in the new subclass.
  But this can be easier done by using the DateLib and/or the Amiga-OS support
  functions.
  Btw. the same happens for IDL, but by using C++ it is possible to inherite
  the implementation.
  A future release of Date.mcc will include a full skeleton C code, so that
  everyone can start his subclasses on this.


Please note, that you can not compile Date.mcc!
This is because I don't want to distribute the folowing files at the moment:
date.h, datesys.h, date_pragmas.h
These files are part of my DateLib (TM) project. A new release will be
available in 1997.
Please note that the supplied source is version 12.0!


Btw. it would be wise to use a

 SetAttrs(obj,
            MUIA_Date_Year,   year,
            MUIA_Date_Month,  month,
            MUIA_Date_Day,    day,
          TAG_DONE
         );

instead of single set()'s.




History
-------

27.11.1997 -	First release on Aminet

- Notify on locale preference change (country/language)




Known problems
--------------

- Old versions of the program called 'PhoneCost' written by André Schenk
  <schenkae@tick.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de> installed another
  'date.library' into 'Libs:'.
