Guidelines
==========

 1. Alawys sends to <alforan@tin.it>:
    - CD file
    - CT file
    - CATALOG file

 2. Never release translation for betas.
    The MCC is considered beta if not
    present on Aminet.

 3. Catalog has to be set to the version
    of the MCC it was written for.

 4. SpeedBarCfg MSG_BORDERLESS, MSG_RAISED,
    MSG_SMALL and MSG_HIGHLIGHT should be
    termineted with a "?" (if that is correct
    in your language).

 5. SpeedBar.catalog contains many strings
    with short-cuts. Try to define a shortcut
    for any string that needs it (use fkeys).

 6. XXX_HELP must be terminated with a "."
    (if that is correct in your language).

 7. XXX_HELP must not be too long.

 8. MSG_INFO_FIRST MUST BE EXACTLY 2 LINES HIGH.

 9. MSG_INFO_TRANSLATOR may be put to your infos
    e.g.

    "Englis translation by Jhon Smith <jhons@aol.com>"

    Don't insert copyright notes in it.

10. Thanks in advance.
