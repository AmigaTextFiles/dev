   SpeedBar allows you to easily create toolbars similar to those
   you can see in Windows programs (although you can get a
   standard look as well ;)

   SpeedBar is very easy to program. All you have to do is to
   supply a description of the buttons and a description of the
   images to use.

   The buttons are defined via MUIA_SpeedBar_Buttons tag. You
   have to pass a struct MUIS_SpeedBar_Button array, the fields
   of which are:

   - Img
     the index of the image to use for this button

   - Text
     the label for this button

   - Help
     an help string to use as ShortHelp

   - Flags
     flags for this button

   - Class
     if you subclassed SpeedButton.mcc, pass your subclass here.

   - Object
     this will be filled after the object was created. Just don't
     use it :-)

   Example:

   struct MUIS_SpeedBar_Button buttons[] =
   {
       {0, "_Get", "Get the disc.", 0, NULL},
       {1, "Sa_ve", "Save the disc.", 0, NULL},
       {2, "_Stop", "Stop the connection.", 0, NULL},
       {MUIV_SpeedBar_Spacer},
       {3, "_Disc", "Disc page.", 0, NULL},
       {4, "_Matches", "Matches page.", 0, NULL},
       {5, "_Edit", "Edit page.", 0, NULL},
       {MUIV_SpeedBar_End},
   };

   Note that the array must be always terminated with
   MUIV_SpeedBar_End.

   You may add other buttons at any time via
   MUIM_SpeedBar_AddButton and MUIM_SpeedBar_AddSpacer .

   The button definition is copied, so you may discard it after
   use. Help is not copied !

   The description of the image may be supplied in different
   ways:

   @{u}MUIA_SpeedBar_Images@{uu}
   you load the single images and set up an array of struct
   MyBrush * . The array may be freed after use (the array, not
   the BitMaps!).

   @{u}MUIA_SpeedBar_Pics@{uu}
   you want SpeedBar.mcc to load the single images for you. Pass
   here a NULL-terminated array of STRPTR, names of the images to
   load via datatypes. The array may be freed after use.

   @{u}MUIA_SpeedBar_Strip@{uu}
   the images are saved as a Strip: all together separeted via a
   single blank pixels column. The strip will be load via
   datatypes. The number of the buttons is derived via
   MUIA_SpeedBar_Buttons or as defined in
   MUIA_SpeedBar_StripButtons (if you want to add buttons later).
   Pass a STRPTR, the name of the strip, here. It may be freed
   after use.

   @{u}MUIA_SpeedBar_StripBrush@{uu}
   as the above but you load the strip by yourself. Pass a struct
   MyBrush *, definition of the strip, here. It may be freed
   after use (the pointer not the BitMap!).

   When using a strip, all the pics must have the same width. No
   requester is shown and no error is reported if the supplied
   strip is invalid. You will see that by yourself :-)

   The MUIA_SpeedBar_PicDrawer attribute me be used to define a
   path for the pics and the strip to be be load via datatypes.

   Never cache the single buttons objects pointer: if you set the
   attributes:

   - MUIA_SpeedBar_BarSpacer

   and if the object already setup:
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_Borderless
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_ViewMode
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_SmallImages
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_Sunny

   all the buttons are disposed an recreated!

   To invoke a method over a buttons use MUIM_SpeedBar_DoOnButton
   or MUIM_SpeedBar_GetObject .

   Always let the user modify the aspect of the bar via:

   - MUIA_SpeedBar_BarSpacer
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_Borderless
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_ViewMode
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_SmallImages
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_Sunny
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_Raising
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_LabelPosition
   - MUIA_SpeedBar_EnableUnderscore

   For subclass: set the above values before calling the super
   method in you MUIM_Setup: this will avoid to recrate all the
   buttons.

   If possible, put the bar in a Virtgroup: this will not stress
   the user if very big fonts and or images are used.

   MUIA_SpeedBar_EnableUnderscore is a S attribute, but it must
   be inited as TRUE to be settable.

   If the action taken at a button pressing takes very long time,
   consider to PushMethod it rather than notify; that means
   sometimes

   DoMethod(DoMethod(sb,MUIM_SpeeBar_GetButton,I),MUIM_Notify,
       MUIA_Pressed,FALSE,app,X,MUIM_Application_PushMethod,
       obj,Y,...);

   may be better than

   DoMethod(DoMethod(sb,MUIM_SpeeBar_GetButton,I),MUIM_Notify,
       MUIA_Pressed,FALSE,obj,Y,...);


   Note the BitMaps passes in the BitMap fiels of struct MyBrush
   have to be standard V42 BitMaps; while remapping they are
   converted to screen friend ones.
