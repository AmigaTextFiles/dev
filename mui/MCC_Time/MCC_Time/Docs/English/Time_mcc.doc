Description
-----------

Time is an abstract Custom Class of the Magic User Interface © by Stefan Stuntz.
It's a subclass of notify-class and only usable for developers who want to
build subclasses of Time.mcc!

The idea of this class was born during developing my Gregor application.

MUI abstract public custom class that allowing easy handling of time. Because
it is abstract it is only usefull for developers working with classes that are
based on Time.mcc (like TimeString.mcc), or those who want to build their own
Time.mcc based classes.

Time.mcc features:
- Handles daylight savings time
- Handles time zones
- Supports MUIM_Import and MUIM_Export
- Supports drops of other time objects and time-strings
- The time can be read in hour/minutes/seconds format or as seconds from
  midnight on
- The time range can be restricted
- It's possible to notify a Date.mcc object when the next or previous day
  was reached
- Method to set the current time
- Methods for increasing and decreasing the time
- Method to compare with another time object




Requirements
------------

- MUI 3.1 (Version 12)
- date.library

- To use the Greek MCC-Install script you need the
  "Greek Workbench" © AC Software

- To use the Russian MCC-Install script you need
  "Rusifier" © Dmitry Mikhilov



Installation
------------

Please only install Time.mcc when you are a developer!

Use the installer script!
(The Installer must be in your system-path!)

If you use an Installer prior to V42 you should set the LANGUAGE Tooltype to
your language. Installer V42 and better automatically use your current locale.


Please note that the installer-script is very special, because:

- It features uninstallation
- It is automated
- It is very flexible
- It is very intelligent (for an installer-script ;-)
- It uses WrapGuide (if present) for the AmigaGuide®
  documentation if running under a pre V39 system.
- It can be reused by (hopefully) all other MUI custom classes, because the
  authors of custom classes need to only change a few things:

  * The #copyright variable
  * The #min_os_version and #min_os_revision variables
  * The #min_mui_version and #min_mui_revision variables
  * The #language_mcc and #language_mcp variables
  * The P_CustomExists, P_CustomInstall and P_CustomUninstall procedures
  * The 'APPNAME' tooltype within the MCC-Install icon.



Information for Developers
--------------------------

There is no multiple inheritance for Boopsi/MUI for the moment, so we haven't
any chance to create a real Time basis-class. But there is another way to have
the same result (compatibility for all classes that are dealing with time).
The solution is called interface inheritance like it was done with IDL for
CORBA.
Interface inheritance has some advantages and some disadvantages.

The advantages are:
- (Pseudo) multiple inheritance
- The same interface for all classes dealing with Time

The disadvantages are:
- Every one who wants to subclass Time.mcc must include the code for Time.mcc
  in the new subclass.
  But this can be easier done by using the DateLib and/or the Amiga-OS support
  functions.
  Btw. the same happens for IDL, but by using C++ it is possible to inherite
  the implementation.
  A future release of Time.mcc will include a full skeleton C code, so that
  everyone can start his subclasses on this.


Please note, that you can not compile Time.mcc!
This is because I don't want to distribute the folowing files at the moment:
datetime.h, datesys.h, date_pragmas.h
These files are part of my DateLib (TM) project. A new release will be
available in 1997.
Please note that the supplied source is version 12.0!


Btw. it would be wise to use a

 SetAttrs(obj,
            MUIA_Time_Hour,  hour,
            MUIA_Time_Min,   min,
            MUIA_Time_Sec,   sec,
          TAG_DONE
         );

instead of single set()'s.
