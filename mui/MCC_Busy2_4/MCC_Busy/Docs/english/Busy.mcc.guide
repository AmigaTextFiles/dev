What is Busy.mcc?
*****************

   Busy is a Custom Class of the Magic User Interface (c) by Stefan
Stuntz. It's a subclass of area-class, which allocates inputhandlers
and pens with MUI.

   The idea of this class was born if I was trying the search functions
on a MAC system. If the search is spending a lot of time a striped
scrolling rectangle is shown, to display the activity of the machine.

   The style and speed can be defined by user, but the programmer
decides if the speed is copied, overwitten or set to null, the BusyBar
is moved manually.
