    This class is a fairly simple implementation of a "LED-like" indicator which
provides the programmer with a new method for communicating program state to
the user. Unlike other similar implementations, TWFmultiLED allows both the
user and programmer to specify both the shape of the indicator and it's colour.

    Via the preferences program the user can specify the RGB makeup of the 6
internal colours (used to represent the states "Off", "On", "Ok", "Loading",
"Error" and "Panic") and the default shape of the indicator. The programmer
can abide by the user's choice of shape, or override it and use one fo the
other shapes. The programmer can also set the indicator to any of the 6 user
defined colours or to a custom colour the programmer specifies.

TWFmultiLED.mcc/MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Colour

  NAME
    MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Colour -- [IS.], ULONG

  INPUTS
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Off       Set LED to user defined Off colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_On        Set LED to user defined On colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Ok        Set LED to user defined Ok colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Working   Set LED to user defined Working colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Waiting   Set LED to user defined Waiting colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Load      Set LED to user defined Load colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Cancelled Set LED to user defined Cancelled colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Stopped   Set LED to user defined Stopped colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Error     Set LED to user defined Error colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Panic     Set LED to user defined Panic colour.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Custom    Set LED to programmer specified colour

    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Off is the default value.

  FUNCTION
    This attribute allows you to change the colour shown in the indicator. The
    indicator will only change colour if the value you specify is valid and
    the pen for that colour has been obtained successfully.


  NOTE
    Specifying MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Custom will have no effect unless you
    have set a value for MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Custom AND the window is open.
    Specifying MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Custom during initialisation will have
    no effect.


  BUGS
    No known bugs.

TWFmultiLED.mcc/MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Custom

  NAME
    MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Custom -- [IS.], struct TWFmultiLED_RGB *


  FUNCTION
    Using this attribute, the programmer can specify an RGB value to display in
    the indicator. The RGB values should be 32 bit left justified fractions
    as used by graphics.library/SetRGB32()


  EXAMPLE

    struct TWFmultiLED_RGB egColour = { 0xFFFFFFFF, 0, 0xFFFFFFFF };

    ...

    Child, ML_Indicator = TWFmultiLEDObject,
        ...
    End,

    ...

    set(ML_Indicator, MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Custom, &egColour);
    set(ML_Indicator, MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Colour, MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Custom);


  BUGS
    No known bugs.

TWFmultiLED.mcc/MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Free

  NAME
    MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Free -- [IS.], BOOL


  FUNCTION
    This attribute only affects the square and rectangular indicators. If set
    to TRUE then both the maximum height and width are set to 40. The indicator
    will resize as the user changes the window size.


  BUGS
    No known bugs.

TWFmultiLED.mcc/MUIA_TWFmultiLED_TimeDelay

  NAME
    MUIA_TWFmultiLED_TimeDelay -- [IS.], ULONG


  INPUTS
    Delay, in seconds, between the LED colour being set and it being automatically
    reset to MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Colour_Off. To deactivate this feature you can
    supply the special value.


  SPECIAL VALUES
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_TimeDelay_User     Use the user's setting

    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_TimeDelay_Off      Disable the deactivation feature.
                                        (This is the default)

  FUNCTION
    This attribute allows an indicator lamp to "turn itself off" automatically
    after a delay period. This could be useful in many situations, especially
    if the indicator is being used to display repeating events.


  BUGS
    None reported. This is the least tested of the features so there may be
    some bugs I have not found. Please inform me immediately if anything
    unexpected occurs while using this attribute.

  NAME
    MUIA_TWFmultiLED_Type -- [IS.], ULONG


  INPUTS
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Type_Round5    Indicator is drawn as a small circle.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Type_Round11   Indicator is drawn as a large circle.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Type_Square5   Indicator is drawn as a small square.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Type_Square11  Indicator is drawn as a large square.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Type_Rect11    Indicator is drawn as a small rectangle.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Type_Rect15    Indicator is drawn as a large rectangle.
    MUIV_TWFmultiLED_Type_User      The indicator shape is set by the user,
                                    this is the default.


  FUNCTION
    This attribute allows the programmer to alter the shape of the indicator.
    This should not be used unless absolutely necessary - the user's
    preference is the default and you should not override it unless you
    have a very good reason.


  NOTE
    When you set this attribute, the indicator will be temporarily hidden
    and then redisplayed. This forces MUI to ask for the indicator's
    dimensions but it may affect your layout.


  BUGS
    No known bugs.
