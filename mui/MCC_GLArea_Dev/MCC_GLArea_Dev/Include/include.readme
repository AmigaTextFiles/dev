GLArea don't uses the standard link library of stormmesa, because I had
to handle multi-process access to the GL libraries.
So I generated the needed inline files for GCC only, for other compilers you have
to generate pragma files yourself (try fd2pragma by Dirk Stoecker).

You have to copy all includes files provided in this directory in you standard
include path to be able to compile GLArea.mcc applications.
I had to modify some part (very small parts) of the original GL includes.

To use it in your application, only include <proto/Amigamesa.h>

If you have problems, you could contact me (sbodmer@lsi-media.ch).
If you generated pragma files for other compilers, don't hesitate to
send me your files, I will include it in my next release.
