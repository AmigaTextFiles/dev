If you use th *_debug version of the library, you could do some output
on the screen from your drawing function.

When you start you application some windows will open:
1) The main window (top of the screen) is the GLArea.mcc global environnement.
2) Each GLArea object will open a window where you could output some information
3) When a GLArea is not a single task then another window representing the
   sub-process will also open. You could do output here too.

To access the correspondant console windows, get the fh field in the GLContext struct
FPrint(glcontext->fh,"...%ld",value);

These consoles windows helped me a lot debugging my class ;^)
