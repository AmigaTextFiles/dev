<p align=center><b>About the SHAREWARE fee</b></p>
The first releases of HTMLtext.mcc were GIFTWARE, but the resonance
was quite poor. Because I spend a lot of time to write this class and
because I am a student that always needs money, I decided to make it
SHAREWARE but to not limit the functionality of the program. Some
people just pay if there are some limitations, but it is a lot of work
for me to send registrations and there are already good browsers out
there that request a Shareware fee too, and that wasn't the goal of
this project. The class will be published in future for the Amiga OS
fully functionally, too, but I may criple it a bit in the pOS version
that I plan to do. So please send something for the authors effort of
SHAREWARE, otherwise they will become frustrated and stop writing
programs. Remember the advanteges of SHAREWARE to comercial software:
<ul>
<li> Quite cheap
<LI> User writes for users
<LI> You may write directly to the author
<LI> Bugfixing and implementation of function within short time
<li> No taxes :)
</ul>
As a small incentive I will only allow registred users to have a look
into the sourcecode of the class and the browser.
