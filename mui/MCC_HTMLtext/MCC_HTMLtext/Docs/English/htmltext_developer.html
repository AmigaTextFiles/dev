The include files are only available for C and AmigaE, yet. Please
refer to the <a href="htmltext_autodocs.html">Autodocs</a> for further
informations. But generally you just have to insert something like the
following in your applications declaration to get a working HTMLtext
object:

<pre>
   ...
   Child, HTMLtextObject,
      MUIA_HTMLtext_Contents, &quot;This is a &lt;b&gt;Test&lt;/b&gt;.&quot;,
      End,
   ...
</pre>
But don't forget, that HTMLtext.mcc uses some more memory and is
slower than TextObject and it doesn't always make sense to use it.
<p>
For a completer example refer to the source of
<tt>/text/hyper/moreHTML.lha</tt> to be found on Aminet including its
sourcecodes.

<p>
If you want to use HTMLtext.mcc using C++ please have a look at
<tt>&quot;dev/mui/MUIPlusPlus.lha&quot;</tt> written by <em>Nicholas Allen</em>.
