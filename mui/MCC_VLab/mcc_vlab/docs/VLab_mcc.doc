What is VLab.mcc and VLab.mcp
****************************************************************

   VLab is a Custom Class for the Magic User Interface © by Stefan
Stuntz. It's a subclass of area-class.

Features include:

* Open a monitor in a VLab.mcc window.
* Open a monitor in your own window.
* Image grabbing in all modes (PAL/NTSC/FULLFRAME/HALFFRAME).
* YUV to RGB conversion.
* De-Interlacing of grabbed images.
* Obtain pointers to image buffers for saving etc.
* Grabbed images can be buffered on disk (virtual memory).
* Simply adding a grabbed image to a group in a window will display it.
* Supports both CyberGraphX and guigfx.library.

There is a prefs class VLab.mcp with it, which permits the
user to choose all default VLab card settings as well as
virtual memory settings.



What you need!
**************

   - MUI 3.6+
   - AmigaOS V37+ (2.x)



What else is required

   - CyberGraphX

   OR

   - guigfx.library
