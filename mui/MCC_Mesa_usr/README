You need AmigaMesaRTL v2.0 to use Mesa MUI class!

INSTALLATION: copy all files from 'libs' to MUI:libs/mui/ directory


After that, start MUI preferences. If everything went ok, you will see
a new Mesa page with animated graphics. If the picture doesn't show up,
try to select another output handler. As usual, to test your settings,
click on the 'Test' button.

Don't forget to check out the demos!
