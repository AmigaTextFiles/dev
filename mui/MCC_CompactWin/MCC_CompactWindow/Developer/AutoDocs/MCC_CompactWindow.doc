This class is an alternative window class for MUI. The standard one
is very awkward in certain situations, especially with small windows.
You know the problems:  a window is not draggable because border gadgets
have 'eaten' the titlebar or it looks extremly ugly with borders and
gadgets bigger than the usable area!

The CompactWindow solves these problems:
 - uses Tiny Font for titlebar so it can fit even in small windows
   (don't forget to set tiny font in MUI prefs!)
 - titlebar can even become vertical when the window is narrow
 - has no additional gadgets
 - has no useless borders
 - entire border can be used for sizing
 - context menu gives additional functionality in place of
   missing gadgets

NEW since 12.2:
 - all known bugs fixed
 - vertical titlebar rendering should work on all gfx systems
 - 'contents' is really [ISG]
 - new attribute: 'NoGadgets'


CompactWindow class is Polymorphware.  That means, if you use it in your
program, you have to pay/send me what you expect from your users, eg.  if
it is 'Chocolateware' you should send me a bar of chocolate.  Freeware
programs can use TearOff for free, of course.

CompactWindow.mcc/MUIA_CompactWindow_Contents

    NAME
	MUIA_CompactWindow_Contents -- [ISG], Object *

    FUNCTION
   Any object to be placed in the window.
   This is like MUIA_Window_RootObject in standard Window MUI class.

    NOTE
   It's possible to create the window with no contents,
   but you have to set the contents before the window is opened!

CompactWindow.mcc/MUIA_CompactWindow_CloseGadget

    NAME
	MUIA_CompactWindow_CloseGadget -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
   FALSE means window doesn't have close gadget.
   Default is TRUE.

CompactWindow.mcc/MUIA_CompactWindow_NoGadgets

    NAME
	MUIA_CompactWindow_NoGadgets -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
   When TRUE, all window gadgets are disabled.
   Such a window is almost like the standard one but
   it still has the context menu.
   "CloseGadget=TRUE,NoGadgets=TRUE" is perfectly ok,
   and gives you the 'close' menuoption enabled but no
   close gadget on window border.
   
CompactWindow.mcc/MUIA_CompactWindow_HVPreference

    NAME
	MUIA_CompactWindow_HVPreference -- [ISG], int, -100..+100

    FUNCTION
   CompactWindow's titlebar can be horizontal (when its width
   is greater than height) or vertical (otherwise).
   With this attribute you can change that default behavior.
   
   -100  horizontal only
    ...  horizontal is preferred
    0    default (no special preference)
    ...  vertical is preferred
   +100  vertical only

    NOTE
   I don't know if this tag is really useful. User can set his
   preference in mcp and he won't be happy if you changed it.

CompactWindow.mcc/MUIA_CompactWindow_SizeGadget

    NAME
	MUIA_CompactWindow_SizeGadget -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
   FALSE means window doesn't have size gadget (actually it
   is size border...). Default is TRUE.
   Anyway, size gadget disappears if the window contents is
   not sizeable.

CompactWindow.mcc/MUIA_CompactWindow_Title

    NAME
	MUIA_CompactWindow_Title -- [ISG], char *

    FUNCTION
   A title of the window.

    NOTE
   The string is not copied!
