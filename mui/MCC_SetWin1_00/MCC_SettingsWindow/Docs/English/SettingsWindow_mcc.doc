SettingsWindow.mcc 1.00 (19.07.1998) Documentation
**************************************************

This might be the last release of SettingsWindow.mcc. I stopped developing
for AmigaOS to focus on my (new) favourite OS, the BeOS. That's why I
decided to include the source code - more as a bad example than as a
useful source of information. ;-)

SettingsWindow.mcc is copyrighted by Ingo Weinhold, but it may be freely
distributed as long as the package stays unmodified.
The package consists of:

* the SettingsWindow-Demo and its source code SettingsWindow-Demo.c
* MCC_SettingsWindow.doc - the autodoc file
* SettingsWindow_mcc.h - the C include file
* SettingsWindow_mcc.doc - this documentation
* SettingsWindow.mcc - the MUI customclass
* SettingsWindow_mcc.catalog files
* SettingsWindow_mcc.cd - the catalog descriptor
* SettingsWindow_mcc_empty.cd - the empty catalog translation
* SettingsWindow_mcc.ct files
* the SettingsWindow.mcc sources


Developers are strongly encouraged to use this software in their
applications, as it is meant for that purpose.
Using this software still requires

* including a SettingsWindow.mcc copyright notice
  (a half line is absolutely enough),
* an information where to get the latest version of the original archive
  (e.g. Aminet dev/mui).

(Informing me what program SettingsWindow.mcc is used for would make me
happy.)

If you consider distributing the SettingsWindow class as part of your
software, you are allowed to include at least

* SettingsWindow.mcc,
* all SettingsWindow_mcc.catalog files.
* the ato.readme and Farsi.readme created by the ATO (Amiga Translators'
  Organization)

As mentioned above the complete SettingsWindow.mcc sources are included.
You are allowed to take parts of them to reuse it in your own projects.
No conditions are attached to this, but I would like you to contact/inform
me.

The cataloges and cataloge translations (except the German ;-) were created
by the ATO - read the ato.readme (in the archive's root directory) for more
information. Persian native users should take a look into Farsia.readme.

Description

SettingsWindow.mcc is a custom class of the Magic User Interface (c) by
Stefan Stuntz.
It is a subclass of Window.mui that allows you to easily manage your

to react on changing settings. A row of buttons and a menu let the user have
the standard save, use, load functions.
