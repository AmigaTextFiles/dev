                    Future plans for the MUI system
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although  MUI  currently  allows  creation  of  really  big  and complex
applications, it is of course not finished yet. There are lots of things
that  could  and  that  will be implemented following releases. Here are
some of my major plans for future development:

- Support for drag and drop objects.

- A multiline edit gadget with some basic editing capabilities.

- More classes: date class, time class, calendar class, floating point
                class, etc.

These few topics were only a small piece of my 'todo' file. In fact, the
list  is  a  lot  bigger  and grows every day due to the large amount of
suggestions  I receive. The response is really enormous, I spend quite a
lot  of  time  with answering e-mail every day. Please don't stop having
good ideas, that's what a product like MUI needs!
