	Objects of window class are used to generate windows and
	supply a place where MUI gadgets feel well. It handles
	the complicated task of window resizing fully automatic,
	you don't need to worry about that.

	Windows are children of an application, you cannot use
	a window object without having a parent application
	object. On the other side, the gadgets in a window
	are children of the window, you cannot use MUI gadgets
	without having a parent MUI window.

	Creating a window object does not mean to open it
	instantly. This is done later by setting the window's
	MUIA_Window_Open attribute. If your application has
	several windows, the usual way is to create them all
	at once at startup time and open/close it later
	just by setting MUIA_Window_Open.

	There is no difference in talking to gadgets whether
	their parent window is open or not. If you e.g. set
	the contents of a string gadget in an open window,
	the gadget will refresh immediately. If the window is
	closed, the gadget just remembers its new setting
	and displays it later.

	have a close gadget.
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_CloseRequest

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_CloseRequest -- [..G], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	When the user hits a windows close gadget, the
	window isn't closed immediately. Instead MUI only
	sets this attribute to TRUE to allow your application
	to react.

	Usually, you will setup a notification that automatically
	closes the window when a close request appears, but you
	could e.g. pop up a confirmation requester or do some
	other things first.

    EXAMPLE
	/* automagically close a window     */
	/* when the close gadget is pressed */

	as long as no other object is active. Good candidates
	for default objects are e.g. lonely listviews. Making
	such a listview the default object will allow the user
	to control it immediately without the need of several
	tab strokes for activation.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_ActiveObject
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_DepthGadget

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_DepthGadget -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Enable or disable the depth gadget. Defaults to TRUE.
	There is no good reason to use this tag.
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_DragBar

Window.mui/MUIA_Window_Height

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_Height -- [I.G], LONG

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Window_Height_MinMax(p)
	MUIV_Window_Height_Visible(p)
	MUIV_Window_Height_Screen(p)
	MUIV_Window_Height_Scaled
	MUIV_Window_Height_Default

    FUNCTION
	Specify the height of a window. Usually, you won't give
	a pixel value here but instead use one of the following
	magic macros:

	MUIV_Window_Height_Default:
	   calculated from objects default sizes.

	MUIV_Window_Height_MinMax(0..100):
	   somewhere between the minimum height (0) and the
	   maximum height (100) of your window.

	MUIV_Window_Height_Visible(1..100):
	   percentage of the screens visible height.

	MUIV_Window_Height_Screen(1..100):
	   percentage of the screens total height.

	MUIV_Window_Height_Scaled:
	   height will be adjusted so that
	   width : height == minimum width : minimum height.
	   Note that a windows width and height may not
	   both be scaled.

	Default for this tag is MUIV_Window_Height_Default.

	As long as your window has a window id (MUIA_Window_ID),
	choosing a size is not that important. MUI will always
	remember a windows last position and size and these
	values will simply override your settings. Positioning
	and sizing should be completely under user control,
	a programmer doesn't need to worry about it.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_Width, MUIA_Window_ID
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_ID

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_ID -- [ISG], ULONG

    FUNCTIONS
	For most of your windows, you should define a longword
	as id value. Only a window with an id is able to
	remember its size and position.

	Additionally, when you use an ascii id (e.g. 'MAIN'),
	your window can be controlled from ARexx.

	Of course all windows of your application must have
	unique ids.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_LeftEdge
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_InputEvent

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_InputEvent -- [..G], struct InputEvent *

    FUNCTION
	This attribute gets set whenever your window receives
	a rawkey input event. You can react on this by creating
	a notification event containing a standard
	commodities.library input description string.

    EXAMPLE
	DoMethod(window, MUIM_Notify,
	   MUIA_Window_InputEvent, "control p",
	   txobj, 3,
	   MUIM_Set, MUIA_Text_Contents, "user pressed ctrl p");
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_LeftEdge

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_LeftEdge -- [I.G], LONG

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Window_LeftEdge_Centered
	MUIV_Window_LeftEdge_Moused

    FUNCTION
	Specify the left edge of a window. Usually, you shouldn't
	define a pixel value here but instead use one of the
	following macros:

	MUIV_Window_LeftEdge_Centered:
	   window appears centered on the visible area of screen.

	MUIV_Window_LeftEdge_Moused
	   window appears centered under the mouse pointer.

	Default for this tag is MUIV_Window_LeftEdge_Centered.

	As long as your window has a window id (MUIA_Window_ID),
	choosing a position is not that important. MUI will always
	remember a windows last position and size and these
	values will simply override your settings. Positioning
	and sizing should be completely under user control,
	a programmer doesn't need to worry about it.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_TopEdge, MUIA_Window_ID
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_Menu

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_Menu -- [I..], struct NewMenu *

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Window_Menu_NoMenu

    FUNCTION
	Set a menu for this window. Normally, you would
	use MUIA_Application_Menu to set the same menu
	for all subwindows of your application.
	MUIA_Window_Menu will override a possible
	MUIA_Application_Menu setting.

	For details about menu handling, please see
	MUIA_Application_Menu.

	A value of MUIV_Window_Menu_NoMenu for this
	tag means that you want no menu for this window,
	even if you have a global one for your application.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Application_Menu, MUIA_Window_NoMenus
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_NoMenus

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_NoMenus -- [.S.], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Temporarily disable the menu strip of a window.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_Menu
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_Open

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_Open -- [.SG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	This little attribute can be used to open and close
	a window. When opening a window, MUI does lots of
	stuff to calculate sizes and positions of all
	gadgets. Minimum and maximum window sizes will be
	adjusted automatically.

	When the minimum size of a window is too big to fit
	on the screen, MUI tries to reduce font sizes and
	does a new calculation. You should always design
	your windows to fit on a 640*200 screen with
	all fonts set to topaz/8.

	When a window is closed (and you specified a
	MUIA_Window_ID), MUI remembers its position
	and size and uses these values during the next
	opening.

	After setting MUIA_Window_Open to TRUE, you should
	test if MUI was able to open the window by getting
	the attribute again. If you don't and if this was
	the only window of your application, the user won't
	be able to do any input and your application will
	seem to hang.

    EXAMPLE
	set(window,MUIA_Window_Open,TRUE);
	get(window,MUIA_Window_Open,&open);
	if (!open)
	{
	   MUI_Request(app,0,0,0,"Ok","Failed to open window.");
	   exit(20);
	}

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_RootObject
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_PublicScreen

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_PublicScreen -- [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	Force the window to appear on the public screen who's name
	is specified by this attribute. This tag overrides the
	user preferences setting and is overridden by
	MUIA_Window_Screen.

	Please use this tag sparely, overriding user prefs is
	not a good idea!

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_Screen
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_RefWindow

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_RefWindow -- [IS.], Object *

    FUNCTION
	Setting MUIA_Window_RefWindow to another MUI window
	object will make the left and top position relative
	to this reference window. Using the
	MUIA_Window_Left(Top)Edge_Centered tag, you can easily
	open one window within another.

	Note that if your window has an id, the window will
	remember its last position and reopen there. Thus,
	this tag is only useful if you omit MUIA_Window_ID,
	maybe for some small requester windows.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_ID, MUIA_Window_LeftEdge
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_RootObject

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_RootObject -- [I..], Object *

    FUNCTION
	This is a pointer to a MUI object and defines the
	contents of your window. Usually, this root object
	will be of class MUIC_Group since you surely want to
	have more than one gadget.

	The root object is treated as child of a window
	and will be disposed when the window is disposed.
	Note that windows can only have one child.

	Although you may create a window without root object,
	you have to set one before the window is openend!

    EXAMPLE
	win = WindowObject, MUIA_Window_RootObject,
	   VGroup,
	      Child, ...,
	      Child, ...,
	      End,
	   End;

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_Open
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_Screen

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_Screen -- [ISG], struct Screen *

    FUNCTION
	You can get a pointer to the parent screen of a window by 
	getting this attribute. The result will be NULL when the
	window is currently closed.

	Specifying MUIA_Window_Screen at object creation time or
	with a SetAttrs() call allows you to explicitly tell MUI
	on which screen the window should be opened. You normally
	won't need this feature and leave the decision about
	screens to the users preferences setting.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_PublicScreen, MUIA_Window_Window
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_ScreenTitle

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_ScreenTitle -- [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	This text will appear in the screens title bar
	when the window is active.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Window_Title
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_SizeGadget

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_SizeGadget -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Tell MUI if you want a sizing gadget for this window.
	Usually you won't need this attribute since MUI
	will automatically disable the sizing gadget when
	your window is not sizeable because of your gadget
	layout.
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_SizeRight

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_SizeRight -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	When set to TRUE, the size gadget will reside
	in the right window border.
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_Sleep

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_Sleep -- [.SG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	This attribute can be used to put a window to sleep.
	The window gets disabled and a busy pointer appears.

	The attribute contains a nesting count, if you tell
	your window to sleep twice, you will have to tell
	it to wake up twice too.

	A sleeping window cannot be resized.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Application_Sleep
Window.mui/MUIA_Window_Title

    NAME
	MUIA_Window_Title -- [ISG], STRPTR

    FUNCTION

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Window_TopEdge_Centered
	MUIV_Window_TopEdge_Moused
	MUIV_Window_TopEdge_Delta(p)

    FUNCTION
	Specify the top edge of a window. Usually, you shouldn't
	define a pixel value here but instead use one of the
	following macros:

	MUIV_Window_TopEdge_Centered:
	   window appears centered on the visible area of screen.

	MUIV_Window_TopEdge_Moused
	   window appears centered under the mouse pointer.

	MUIV_Window_TopEdge_Delta(p)
	   window appears p pixels below the screens title bar.

	Default for this tag is MUIV_Window_TopEdge_Centered.

	As long as your window has a window id (MUIA_Window_ID),
	choosing a position is not that important. MUI will always
	remember a windows last position and size and these
	values will simply override your settings. Positioning
	and sizing should be completely under user control,
	a programmer doesn't need to worry about it.

	MUIV_Window_Width_Visible(p)
	MUIV_Window_Width_Screen(p)
	MUIV_Window_Width_Scaled
	MUIV_Window_Width_Default

    FUNCTION
	Specify the width of a window. Usually, you won't give
	a pixel value here but instead use one of the following
	magic macros:

	MUIV_Window_Width_Default:
	   calculated from objects default sizes.

	MUIV_Window_Width_MinMax(0..100):
	   somewhere between the minimum width (0) and the

	MUIA_Window_Window -- [..G], struct Window *

    FUNCTION
	When your window is open, you can obtain a pointer
	to the intuition Window structure with this tag
	and use it e.g. in an asl.library requester call.

	Since the user can close your window any time
	(e.g. iconification), you must be prepared to
	receive a NULL pointer as result.
