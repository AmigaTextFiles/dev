	Group class is responsible for the complete layout
	of a MUI window. A group may contain any number of
	child objects, maybe buttons, cycle gadgets or
	even other groups.

	Some attributes of group class define how the children
	of a group are layouted. You can e.g. tell your group
	to place its children horizontally (in a row) or
	vertically (in a column). Since every MUI object knows
	about its minimum and maximum dimensions, group class
	has everything it needs to do that job.

	More sophisticated layout is possible by assigning
	different weights to objects in a group or by
	making a group two-dimensional.

	Beneath the layout issues, a group object passes
	attributes and methods through to all of its
	children. Thus, you can talk and listen to any
	child of a group by talking and listening to the
	group itself.
Group.mui/MUIA_Group_ActivePage

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_ActivePage -- [ISG], LONG

    VERSION
	Available since version 5 of "group.mui".

    FUNCTION
	Set (or get) the active page of a page group.
	Only this active page is displayed, all others
	are hidden.

	The value may range from 0 (for the first child)
	to numchilds-1 (for the last child). Children are
	adressed in the order of creation:

	PageGroup,
	   Child, Page_0_Object,
	   Child, Page_1_Object,
	   Child, Page_2_Object,
	   Child, Page_3_Object,
	   End;

	Note: You may *never* supply an incorrect page value!

Group.mui/MUIA_Group_Child

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_Child -- [I..], Object *

    FUNCTION
	You supply a pointer to a previously created MUI object
	here. This object will be treated as child of the group,
	the group is responsible for positioning the object.

	Of course you can specify any number of child objects,
	limited only by available memory.

	Normally, the value for a MUIA_Group_Child tag is
	a direct call to another MUI_NewObject(), childrens
	are generated "on the fly".

	When a group is disposed, all of its childs will also
	get deleted. If you supply a NULL pointer as child,
	the group object will fail and previously dispose all
	valid childs found in the taglist.

	This behaviour makes it possible to generate a complete
	application within one single (but long) MUI_NewObject()
	call. Error checking is not necessary since every error,
	even if it occurs in a very deep nesting level, will
	cause the complete call to fail without leaving back
	any previously created object.

   EXAMPLES
	Please have a look at some of the supplied example
	programs.

Group.mui/MUIA_Group_Columns

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_Columns -- [IS.], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Indicate number of columns in a two dimensional group.
	If you use this tag, the total number of children must
	be dividable by the number of columns.

	The children will be positioned in a two dimensional
	array, e.g. allowing easy creation of button fields
	(maybe for calculator).

	The children in your taglist are always read line 
	by line.

	When MUI layouts two-dimensional groups, it does
	actually two layout calculations, one for the rows
	and one the columns. Parameters like weights and
	dimensions are handled this way:

	- the minimum width of a column/row is the maximum
	  minimum width of all objects in this column/row.

	- the maximum width of a column/row is the minimum
	  maximum width of all objects in this column/row.

	- the weight of a column/row is the sum of all
	  objects in this column/row.

	Actually, there is no difference if you use
	MUIA_Group_Columns or MUIA_Group_Rows.

    EXAMPLE

	/* group of labeled string gadgets */

	GroupObject,
	   MUIA_Group_Columns, 2,
	   MUIA_Group_Child  , label1,
	   MUIA_Group_Child  , string1,
	   MUIA_Group_Child  , label2,
	   MUIA_Group_Child  , string2,
	   MUIA_Group_Child  , label3,
	   MUIA_Group_Child  , string3,
           ...
	   End;

Group.mui/MUIA_Group_Horiz

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_Horiz -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Boolean value to indicate whether the objects in
	this group shall be layouted horizontally or
	vertically. Defaults to FALSE.

	This is the easy way of telling your group how
	it has to look like. If you want two-dimensional
	groups, you have to use MUIA_Group_Columns
	or MUIA_Group_Rows.

    EXAMPLE
	GroupObject,
	   MUIA_Group_Horiz, TRUE,
	   MUIA_Group_Child, obj1,
	   MUIA_Group_Child, obj2,
	   MUIA_Group_Child, obj3,
	   End;

Group.mui/MUIA_Group_HorizSpacing

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_HorizSpacing -- [IS.], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Number of pixels to be inserted between horizontal
	elements of a group.

	Please use this tag wisely, you will override the
	user's prefered default setting!

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Group_Spacing, MUIA_Group_VertSpacing
Group.mui/MUIA_Group_PageMode

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_PageMode -- [IS.], BOOL

    VERSION
	Available since version 5 of "group.mui".

    FUNCTION
	Settings this attribute to TRUE makes the current group a page
	group. Page groups always display only one their childs, which
	one can be adjusted with the MUIA_Group_ActivePage attribute.

	Imagine you have a preferences window with several different
	pages, e.g. the MUI preferences with object, frame, image,
	font, screen, keyboard and system prefs. Instead of one
	separate window for each group, you could put all pages into
	one page group and have a cycle gadget for page switching.
	This will make your program easier to use since the user
	won't have to handle a lot of windows. However, he will not
	be able to work with more than one page at the same time.

	Sizes are calculated as follows:

	The minimum width/height of a page group is the maximum
	minimum width/height of all its childs.

	The maximum width/height of a page group is the minimum
	maximum width/height of all its childs.

	When the maximum width/height of a child in a page group is
	smaller than the minimum width/height of the page group
	(since it contains another child with big minimum width/height),
	the child be centered.

	Page groups are not limited in depth, children of a page
	group may of course be other page groups.

	If you want to have a gadget only visible under certain
	conditions, you could make a page group containing this
	gadget and an empty rectangle object.

	If you want TAB cycling for the objects in a page group,
	simply include all objects in the cycle chain (as if
	they all were visible at the same time).

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_Rows -- [IS.], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Indicate number of rows in a two dimensional group.
	If you use this tag, the total number of children must
	be dividable by the number of rows.

	The children will be positioned in a two dimensional
	array, e.g. allowing easy creation of button fields
	(maybe for calculator).

	The children in your taglist are always read line
	by line.

	When MUI layouts two-dimensional groups, it does
	actually two layout calculations, one for the rows
	and one the columns. Parameters like weights and
	dimensions are handled this way:

	- the minimum width of a column/row is the maximum
	  minimum width of all objects in this column/row.

	- the maximum width of a column/row is the minimum
	  maximum width of all objects in this column/row.

	- the weight of a column/row is the sum of all
	  objects in this column/row.

	Actually, there is no difference if you use
	MUIA_Group_Columns or MUIA_Group_Rows.

Group.mui/MUIA_Group_SameHeight

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_SameHeight -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Boolean value to indicate that all children of this
	group shall have the same height.

    BUGS
	Up to version 5 of groupclass, using MUIA_Group_SameHeight
	could make objects larger than their maximum height. This
	has been fixed for version 6.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Group_SameSize, MUIA_Group_SameWidth
Group.mui/MUIA_Group_SameSize

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_SameSize -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	This is a shorthand for MUIA_Group_SameWidth and
	MUIA_Group_SameHeight, it sets both of these
	attributes at once.

	Using MUIA_Group_SameSize, you won't need to think
	if your group is horizontal or vertical, both
	cases are handled automatically.

	Forcing all objects of a group to be the same size
	is e.g. useful for a row of buttons. It's visually
	more attractive when these buttons have equal sizes
	instead of being just as big as the text within.

    BUGS
	Up to version 5 of groupclass, using MUIA_Group_SameSize
	could make objects larger than their maximum size. This
	has been fixed for version 6.

    EXAMPLE

	/* three buttons, same size */

	GroupObject,
	   MUIA_Group_Horiz   , TRUE,
	   MUIA_Group_SameSize, TRUE,
	   MUIA_Group_Child   , but1,
	   MUIA_Group_Child   , but2,
	   MUIA_Group_Child   , but3,
	   End;

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_SameWidth -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Boolean value to indicate that all children of this
	group shall have the same width.

    BUGS
	Up to version 5 of groupclass, using MUIA_Group_SameWidth
	could make objects larger than their maximum width. This
	has been fixed for version 6.

Group.mui/MUIA_Group_Spacing

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_Spacing -- [IS.], LONG

    FUNCTION
	This is a shorthand for MUIA_Group_HorizSpacing and
	MUIA_Group_VertSpacing, it sets both of these
	attributes at once.

	Using MUIA_Group_Spacing, you won't need to think
	if your group is horizontal or vertical, both
	cases are handled automatically.

	Note that setting a spacing value for a group
	overrides the user's default settings. Please
	use it only if you have a good reason.

    EXAMPLE

	/* no space between obj1 and obj2: */

	GroupObject,
	   MUIA_Group_Horiz  , TRUE,
	   MUIA_Group_Spacing, 0,
	   MUIA_Group_Child  , obj1,
	   MUIA_Group_Child  , obj2,
	   End;

    NAME
	MUIA_Group_VertSpacing -- [IS.], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Number of pixels to be inserted between vertical
	elements of a group.

	Please use this tag wisely, you will override the
	user's prefered default setting!
