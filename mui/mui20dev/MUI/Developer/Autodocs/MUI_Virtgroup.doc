	Virtgroup class generates special kinds of group objects whose
	children can be a lot larger than the actual group. The group
	acts as a (small) window through which a rectangle area of its
	contents is visible.

	Layout of a virtual groups children doesn't depend on the space
	available for the virtual group object. The children will get
	as much room as they want, usually their default size.

	Virtual groups themselves don't offer any scrollbars to allow
	user interaction. These things are handled by scrollgroup class.
