	Rectangle class seems kind of useless since it
	doesn't define any attributes or methods itself.
	However, objects of this type are frequently
	used in every application. They allow insertion
	of space to control MUI's layout process.

    NAME
	MUIA_Rectangle_HBar -- [I.G], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	When set to TRUE, MUI draws a horizontal bar in the middle of the
	rectangle. Such bars can be used instead of group frames to
	seperate objects in a window.

    EXAMPLE
	/* draw a two pixel high bar in the middle
           of an 8 pixel high rectangle */

	RectangleObject, MUIA_Rectangle_HBar, TRUE, MUIA_FixHeight, 8, End;

    NAME
	MUIA_Rectangle_VBar -- [I.G], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	When set to TRUE, MUI draws a vertical bar in the middle of the
	rectangle. Such bars can be used instead of group frames to
	seperate objects in a window.

    EXAMPLE
	/* draw a two pixel wide bar in the middle
           of an 8 pixel wide rectangle */

	RectangleObject, MUIA_Rectangle_HBar, TRUE, MUIA_FixWidth, 8, End;
