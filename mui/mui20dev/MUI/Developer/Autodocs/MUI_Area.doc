	Area class is a super class for every other MUI class
	except windows and applications. It holds information
	about an objects current position, size and weight
	and manages frames, fonts and backgrounds.

	Additionally, area class handles the user input. By
	setting an objects MUIA_InputMode, you can make it
	behave like a button or like a toggle gadget. That's
	why MUI doesn't offer an extra button class. A button
	is simply a text object with a raised frame and a relverify
	input mode. Since especially group class is a subclass
	of area, you can create rather complex buttons consisting
	of many other display elements.

Area.mui/MUIA_ApplicationObject

    NAME
	MUIA_ApplicationObject -- [..G], Object *

    FUNCTION
	You can obtain a pointer to the application object
	that some gadget belongs to by using this attribute.
	Useful mainly within callback hooks if you do not want
	to deal with global variables.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_WindowObject
Area.mui/MUIA_Background

    NAME
	MUIA_Background -- [IS.], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the background for an object.

	Every MUI object has its own background setting.
	The background is displayed "behind" the actual
	object contents, e.g. behind a the text of a
	text object or behind the image of an image object.

	This attribute takes the same values as MUIA_Image_Spec,
	please refer to autodocs of image class for a complete
	description.

	An object without a specific background setting will
	inherit the pattern from its parent group. The default
	background for a window and many other background
	patterns are adjustable with the preferences program.

	Only a few MUII_xxxxxxx tags make sense as background.
	Important are:

	MUII_ButtonBack:
	   You have to set this when you create a button gadget.
	   Thus, your button will be displayed in the users
	   preferred style.

	MUII_TextBack:
	   Set this when you create a text object with a TextFrame,
	   e.g. some kind of status line. Do *not* use MUII_TextBack
	   for simple text without frame (e.g. gadget labels).

	MUII_BACKGROUND
	MUII_SHADOW
	MUII_SHINE
	MUII_FILL
	MUII_SHADOWBACK
	MUII_SHADOWFILL
	MUII_SHADOWSHINE
	MUII_FILLBACK
	MUII_FILLSHINE
	MUII_SHINEBACK
	MUII_SHINEBACK2:
	   One of MUI's predefined pattern. These are not
	   configurable by the user and will always look the
	   same.

	Note: It is *important* that you test your programs with
	      a fancy pattern configuration. With the default
	      setting you won't notice any errors in your backgrounds.
Area.mui/MUIA_BottomEdge

    NAME
	MUIA_BottomEdge -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	You can use this to read the current position and
	dimension of an object, if you e.g. need it to pop
	up some requester below.

	Of course, this attribute is only valid when the
	parent window of the object is currently open.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_TopEdge, MUIA_Width, MUIA_Height,
	MUIA_RightEdge, MUIA_LeftEdge
Area.mui/MUIA_ControlChar

    NAME
	MUIA_ControlChar -- [I..], char

    FUNCTION
	Pressing the control char will have the same effect
	as pressing return if the object was active.
	
	This can be used to create old style key shortcuts.

	Note: Using an uppercase control char will force
	      the user to press shift.

    SEE ALSO
	mui.h / KeyButton() macro
Area.mui/MUIA_Disabled

    NAME
	MUIA_Disabled -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Disable or enable a gadget. Setting this attribute
	causes a gadget to become disabled, it gets a ghost
	pattern and doesn't respond to user input any longer.

	Disabled gadgets cannot be activated with the TAB key.

	Using MUIA_Disable on a group of objects will disable
	all objects within that group.

    EXAMPLE
	/* we have a radio button gadget with three         */
	/* entries, the third should enable a string gadget */
	/* with additional parameters                       */

	DoMethod(radio, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Radio_Active, 0,
	   string, 3, MUIM_Set, MUIA_Disabled, TRUE);

	DoMethod(radio, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Radio_Active, 1,
	   string, 3, MUIM_Set, MUIA_Disabled, TRUE);

	DoMethod(radio, MUIM_Notify, MUIA_Radio_Active, 2,
	   string, 3, MUIM_Set, MUIA_Disabled, FALSE);
Area.mui/MUIA_ExportID

    NAME
	MUIA_ExportID -- [ISG], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Objects with a non NULL MUIA_ExportID export their
	contents during MUIM_Application_Save and import
	them during MUIM_Application_Load.

	You have to use different ExportIDs for your objects!

    SEE ALSO
	MUIM_Application_Save, MUIM_Application_Load
Area.mui/MUIA_FixHeight

    NAME
	MUIA_FixHeight -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Give your object a fixed pixel height. This tag is
	absolutely not needed in a general MUI application
	and only present for emergency situations. Please
	think twice before using it!

    EXAMPLE
	/* create an 8x8 pixel rectangle with FILLPEN */

	RectangleObject,
	   MUIA_FixWidth  , 8,
	   MUIA_FixHeight , 8,
	   MUIA_Background, MUII_FILL,
	   End;

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_FixWidth, MUIA_FixWidthTxt, MUIA_FixHeightTxt
Area.mui/MUIA_FixHeightTxt

    NAME
	MUIA_FixHeightTxt -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Give your object a fixed pixel height. The height
	will match the height of the given string. This tag is
	absolutely not needed in a general MUI application
	and only present for emergency situations. Please
	think twice before using it!

    EXAMPLE
	/* create a fixed size rectangle with FILLPEN */

	RectangleObject,
	   MUIA_FixWidthTxt , "00:00:00",
	   MUIA_FixHeightTxt, "\n\n",
	   MUIA_Background  , MUII_FILL,

    FUNCTION
	Give your object a fixed pixel width. This tag is
	absolutely not needed in a general MUI application
	and only present for emergency situations. Please
	think twice before using it!

    EXAMPLE
	/* create an 8x8 pixel rectangle with FILLPEN */

	RectangleObject,

Area.mui/MUIA_FixWidthTxt

    NAME
	MUIA_FixWidthTxt -- [I..], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	Give your object a fixed pixel width. The width
	will match the width of the given string. This tag is
	absolutely not needed in a general MUI application
	and only present for emergency situations. Please
	think twice before using it!

    EXAMPLE
	/* create a fixed size rectangle with FILLPEN */

	RectangleObject,

Area.mui/MUIA_Font

    NAME
	MUIA_Font -- [I.G], struct TextFont *

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Font_Inherit
	MUIV_Font_Normal
	MUIV_Font_List
	MUIV_Font_Tiny
	MUIV_Font_Fixed
	MUIV_Font_Title

    FUNCTION
	Every MUI object can have its own font, just set it with
	this tag. Objects without an explicit font setting will
	inherit it from their parent group.

	You normally won't need to open a font yourself, just
	use one of the predefined values to get a font from
	the users preferences.

    EXAMPLE
	/* since the text contains tabs,           */
	/* use the fixed width font for displaying */

	msgread = FloattextObject,
	   MUIA_Font, MUIV_Font_Fixed,
	   ...,
	   End;
Area.mui/MUIA_Frame

    NAME
	MUIA_Frame -- [I..], LONG

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_Frame_None
	MUIV_Frame_Button
	MUIV_Frame_ImageButton
	MUIV_Frame_Text
	MUIV_Frame_String
	MUIV_Frame_ReadList
	MUIV_Frame_InputList
	MUIV_Frame_Prop
	MUIV_Frame_Gauge
	MUIV_Frame_Group
	MUIV_Frame_PopUp
	MUIV_Frame_Virtual
	MUIV_Frame_Slider
	MUIV_Frame_Count

    FUNCTION
	Define a frame for the current object. Since area class
	is a superclass for all elements in a window, you can
	assign frames to every object you wish.

	You don't adjust the style of your frame directly,
	instead you only specify a type:

	MUIV_Frame_Button
	   for standard buttons with text in it.

	MUIV_Frame_ImageButton
	   for small buttons with images, e.g. the arrows
	   of a scrollbar.

	MUIV_Frame_Text
	   for a text field, e.g. a status line display.

	MUIV_Frame_String
	   for a string gadget.

	MUIV_Frame_ReadList
	   for a read only list.

	MUIV_Frame_InputList
	   for a list that handles input (has a cursor).

	MUIV_Frame_Prop
	   for proportional gadgets.

	MUIV_Frame_Group
	   for groups.

	How the frame is going to look is adjustable via the
	preferences program.

	Four spacing values belong to each frame that tell
	MUI how many pixels should be left free between the
	frame and its contents. These spacing values are also
	user adjustable as long as you don't override them
	with one of the MUIA_InnerXXXX tags.

	Note: The first object in a window (MUIA_Window_RootObject)
	      may *not* have a frame. If you need this you will have
	      to create a dummy group with just one child.

    EXAMPLE
	strobj = StringObject,
	   MUIA_Frame, MUIV_Frame_String,
	   End;

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_InnerLeft, MUIA_InnerRight, MUIA_InnerTop,
	MUIA_InnerBottom
Area.mui/MUIA_FramePhantomHoriz

    NAME
	MUIA_FramePhantomHoriz -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Setting this to TRUE causes the specified frame to be
	a horizontal phantom frame. The frame will not appear
	but its vertical components (frame height, inner
	top and inner bottom spacing) will be used to calculate
	positions and dimensions (horizontal components are
	treated as 0).

	This is extremely useful for a correct labeling of objects.
	You would e.g. label a string gadget by using a text object
	with a phantom string frame. Thus, the label text will
	be always on the same vertical position as the string
	gadget text, no matter what spacing values the user
	configured.

    SEE ALSO
	Label() macros in "mui.h".
Area.mui/MUIA_FrameTitle

    NAME
	MUIA_FrameTitle -- [I..], STRPTR

    FUNCTION
	This tag identifies a text string that will be displayed
	centered in the top line of a frame. This can become
	handy if you want to name groups of objects.

	You may not use MUIA_FrameTitle without defining
	a MUIA_Frame.

    EXAMPLE
	VGroup,
	   MUIA_Frame     , MUIV_Frame_Group,
	   MUIA_FrameTitle, "Spacing",
	   ...

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Frame
Area.mui/MUIA_Height

    NAME
	MUIA_Height -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	You can use this to read the current position and
	dimension of an object, if you e.g. need it to pop
	up some requester below.

	Of course, this attribute is only valid when the
	parent window of the object is currently open.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_TopEdge, MUIA_Width, MUIA_LeftEdge,
	MUIA_RightEdge, MUIA_BottomEdge
Area.mui/MUIA_HorizWeight

    NAME
	MUIA_HorizWeight -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the horizontal weight of an object. Usually
	you can simply use MUIA_Weight instead of this tag
	but in some two-dimensional groups it may become
	handy to have different horizontal and vertical 
	weights.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Weight
Area.mui/MUIA_InnerBottom

    NAME
	MUIA_InnerBottom -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the space between an object and its frame.
	Usually you shouldn't use this tag since you will
	override the users preferred default setting.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Frame
Area.mui/MUIA_InnerLeft

    NAME
	MUIA_InnerLeft -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the space between an object and its frame.
	Usually you shouldn't use this tag since you will
	override the users preferred default setting.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Frame
Area.mui/MUIA_InnerRight

    NAME
	MUIA_InnerRight -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the space between an object and its frame.
	Usually you shouldn't use this tag since you will
	override the users preferred default setting.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Frame
Area.mui/MUIA_InnerTop

    NAME
	MUIA_InnerTop -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the space between an object and its frame.
	Usually you shouldn't use this tag since you will
	override the users preferred default setting.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Frame
Area.mui/MUIA_InputMode

    NAME
	MUIA_InputMode -- [I..], LONG

    SPECIAL INPUTS
	MUIV_InputMode_None
	MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify
	MUIV_InputMode_Immediate
	MUIV_InputMode_Toggle

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the input mode for an object.

	MUI has no distinct button class. Instead you can make
	every object (even groups) behave like a button by
	setting an input mode for them. Several input modes
	area available:

	MUIV_InputMode_None:
	   No input, this is not a gadget.

	MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify:
	   For buttons and similar stuff.

	MUIV_InputMode_Immediate:
	   Used e.g. in a radio button object.

	MUIV_InputMode_ToggleSelect:
	   For things like checkmark gadgets.

	The input mode setting determines how a user action
	will trigger the attributes MUIA_Selected, MUIA_Pressed
	and MUIA_Timer. See their documentation for details.

    EXAMPLE
	/* A traditional button, just a text object with */
	/* a button frame and a relverify input mode:    */

	okbutton = TextObject,
	   MUIA_Frame        , MUIV_Frame_Button,
	   MUIA_InputMode    , MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify,
	   MUIA_Text_Contents, "OK",
	   ...

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Selected, MUIA_Timer, MUIA_Pressed
Area.mui/MUIA_LeftEdge

    NAME
	MUIA_LeftEdge -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	You can use this to read the current position and
	dimension of an object, if you e.g. need it to pop
	up some requester below.

	Of course, this attribute is only valid when the
	parent window of the object is currently open.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_TopEdge, MUIA_Width, MUIA_Height,
	MUIA_RightEdge, MUIA_BottomEdge
Area.mui/MUIA_Pressed

    NAME
	MUIA_Pressed -- [..G], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Learn if a button is pressed (or released).
	The MUIA_Pressed attribute of a gadget is triggered
	by some user action, depending on the input mode:

	MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify:
	   - set when lmb is pressed.
	   - cleared when lmb is released and the mouse
	     is still over the gadget (otherwise it will
	     be cleared too, but without triggering a
	     notification event).

	MUIV_InputMode_Immediate:
	   - undefined, use MUIA_Selected for this.

	MUIV_InputMode_Toggle:
	   - undefined, use MUIA_Selected for this.

	Waiting for MUIA_Pressed getting FALSE is the usual
	way to react on button gadgets.

    EXAMPLE
	DoMethod(btcancel,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_Pressed,FALSE,
	   app,2,MUIM_Application_ReturnID,ID_CANCEL);

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Selected, MUIA_Timer, MUIA_ShowSelState, MUIA_InputMode
Area.mui/MUIA_RightEdge

    NAME
	MUIA_RightEdge -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	You can use this to read the current position and
	dimension of an object, if you e.g. need it to pop
	up some requester below.

	Of course, this attribute is only valid when the
	parent window of the object is currently open.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_TopEdge, MUIA_Width, MUIA_Height,
	MUIA_LeftEdge, MUIA_BottomEdge
Area.mui/MUIA_Selected

    NAME
	MUIA_Selected -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Get and set the selected state of a gadget.
	This attribute can be triggered by the user
	clicking on the gadget (or using the keyboard),
	depending on the input mode:

	MUIV_InputMode_RelVerify:
	   - set when lmb is pressed.
	   - cleared when lmb is released.
	   - cleared when the gadget is selected and the
	     mouse leaves the gadget box.
	   - set when the mouse reenters the gadget box.

	MUIV_InputMode_Immediate:
	   - set when lmb is pressed.

	MUIV_InputMode_Toggle:
	   - toggled when lmb is pressed.

	Of course you may set this attribute yourself, e.g.
	to adjust the state of a checkmark gadget.

	A selected gadget will display its border reverse
	and get the configured MUII_SelectedBack background.
	This can be avoided using the MUIA_ShowSelState tag.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Pressed, MUIA_Timer, MUIA_ShowSelState, MUIA_InputMode
Area.mui/MUIA_ShowMe

    NAME
	MUIA_ShowMe -- [ISG], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Objects with this attribute set are not displayed. You can
	set MUIA_ShowMe at any time, causing objects to appear and
	to disappear immediately. A new layout is calculated whenever
	some objects are shown or hidden. When necessary, MUI will
	resize the parent window to make place for the new objects.

    NOTE
	Currently, MUI does a complete window refresh after
	showing/hiding objects. This behaviour might get improved
	in the future.
Area.mui/MUIA_ShowSelState

    NAME
	MUIA_ShowSelState -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
	Normally a gadget will reverse its frame and
	display the configured MUII_SelectetBack background
	pattern in its selected state. For some objects
	(e.g. checkmarks) this is not recommended and
	can be supressed by setting MUIA_ShowSelState
	to FALSE.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Selected
Area.mui/MUIA_Timer

    NAME
	MUIA_Timer -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	MUIA_Timer gets triggered when a relverify button is 
	pressed and (after a little delay) increases every 
	INTUITICK as long as the mouse remains over the gadget.

	This makes it possible to have buttons repeatedly
	cause some actions, just like the arrow gadgets of
	a scrollbar.

    EXAMPLE
	DoMethod(btmore,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_Timer,MUIV_EveryTime,
	   app,2,MUIM_Application_ReturnID,ID_MORE);

	DoMethod(btless,MUIM_Notify,MUIA_Timer,MUIV_EveryTime,
	   app,2,MUIM_Application_ReturnID,ID_LESS);

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Pressed, MUIA_Selected
Area.mui/MUIA_TopEdge

    NAME
	MUIA_TopEdge -- [..G], LONG

    FUNCTION
	You can use this to read the current position and
	dimension of an object, if you e.g. need it to pop
	up some requester below.

	Of course, this attribute is only valid when the
	parent window of the object is currently open.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_LeftEdge, MUIA_Width, MUIA_Height,
	MUIA_RightEdge, MUIA_BottomEdge
Area.mui/MUIA_VertWeight

    NAME
	MUIA_VertWeight -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	Adjust the vertical weight of an object. Usually
	you can simply use MUIA_Weight instead of this tag
	but in some two-dimensional groups it may become
	handy to have different horizontal and vertical
	weights.

    SEE ALSO
	MUIA_Weight
Area.mui/MUIA_Weight

    NAME
	MUIA_Weight -- [I..], LONG

    FUNCTION
	This tag is a shorthand for MUIA_HorizWeight and
	MUIA_VertHeight, it sets both weights at once.

	The weight of an object determines how much room it
	will get during the layout process. Imagine you have
	a 100 pixel wide horizontal group with two string
	gadgets. Usually, each gadget will get half of the
	room and be 50 pixels wide. If you feel the left
	gadget is more important and should be bigger,
	you can give it a weight of 200 (and 100 for
	the right gadget). Because the left gadget is
	twice as "heavy" as the right gadget, it will
	become twice as big (about 66 pixel) as the
	right one (34 pixel).

	Of course giving weights only makes sense if the
	object is resizable. A MUIA_VertWeight for a
	(always fixed height) string gadget is useless.

	An object with a weight of 0 will always stay
	at its minimum size.

	By default, all objects have a weight of 100.

    EXAMPLE
	HGroup,
	   StringGadget, MUIA_Weight,  50, End,
	   StringGadget, MUIA_Weight, 100, End,
	   StringGadget, MUIA_Weight, 200, End,
	   End;
