	The Scrollbar class has no objects and attributes itself.
	It just connects a proportional gadget and two button
	gadgets with approriate imagery to make up a scrollbar.

	Since Scrollbar class is a subclass of Group class,
	every attribute and method is passed through to all
	of its childs. Thus, you can talk and listen to
	a scrollbar as if it was just a single prop gadget.

	You can use the attribute MUIA_Group_Horiz as with
	any other group to determine if the scrollbar should
	be horizontal or vertical. By default, a vertical
	scrollbar is generated.
