   PURPOSE
	muimaster.library contains functions for creating and diposing
	objects, for requester handling and for controlling custom
	classes. Additionally, several of the standard MUI classes are
	built into muimaster.library. For you as a programmer, there
	is no difference between using a builtin class or an external
	class coming as "sys:classes/<foobar>.mui". The MUI object
	generation call takes care of this situation and loads
	external classes automatically when they are needed.

muimaster.library/MUI_DisposeObject       muimaster.library/MUI_DisposeObject

   NAME
	MUI_DisposeObject -- Delete a MUI object.

   SYNOPSIS
	MUI_DisposeObject( object )
	                   A0

	VOID MUI_DisposeObject( APTR );

   FUNCTION
	Deletes a MUI object and all of it's auxiliary data.
	These objects are all created by MUI_NewObject(). Objects
	of certain classes "own" other objects, which will also
	be deleted when the object is passed to MUI_DisposeObject().
	Read the per-class documentation carefully to be aware
	of these instances.

   INPUTS
	object = abstract pointer to a MUI object returned by
	         MUI_NewObject(). The pointer may be NULL, in which case
	         this function has no effect.

   RESULT
	None.

   NAME
	MUI_Error -- Return extra information from the MUI system.

   SYNOPSIS
	LONG MUI_Error(VOID);

   FUNCTION
	Some MUI functions will set an error if they fail for
	some reason. The error functions is task sensitive,
	only the task that caused the error will receive it
	from this function.

   RESULT
	Currently, the following error values are defined:

	MUIE_OK                  - no error, everything allright.
	MUIE_OutOfMemory         - went out of memory.
	MUIE_OutOfGfxMemory      - went out of graphics memory.
	MUIE_InvalidWindowObject - NULL window specified.
	MUIE_MissingLibrary      - can't open a needed library.
	MUIE_NoARexx             - unable to create arexx port.
	MUIE_SingleTask          - application is already running.

   SYNOPSIS
	MUI_FreeClass( classptr )
	               A0

	VOID MUI_FreeClass(struct IClass *classptr);

   FUNCTION
	Free a class pointer obtained with MUI_GetClass(). You may not
	free a class as long as its superclass of some of your custom
	classes. You may not terminate your program without explicitly
	freeing everything obtained with MUI_FreeClass().

   INPUTS
	classptr - pointer obtained with MUI_GetClass().

muimaster.library/MUI_GetClass                 muimaster.library/MUI_GetClass

   NAME
 	MUI_GetClass -- Get a pointer to a MUI class.

   SYNOPSIS
	class = MUI_GetClass( classid )
	D0                    A0

	struct IClass * MUI_GetClass(char *classid);

   FUNCTION
	Get a pointer to a MUI class and prevent the clas from
	being expunged.

	When you create a custom class with intuition.library/MakeClass(),
	you need to specify the direct superclass of your class. Since
	MUI classes are no public boopsi classes, you will need a pointer
	to the IClass structure here. MUI_GetClass() takes a MUI class
	id (e.g. MUIC_Area, MUIC_Text, ...) and returns the associated
	class pointer. When the class is external, its loaded.

	MUI_GetClass() also prevents the specified class from being
	expunged. Once you're done with your custom class, you must
	call MUI_FreeClass() to remove the lock.

   INPUTS
	classid - a string describing the MUI class, e.g.
	          MUIC_Area, MUIC_Group, ...

   RESULT
	class - Pointer to the IClass structure of the specified class.
	        You are neither allowed to alter any of its fields nor
	        to make any assumptions about its contents. The only
	        valid use for this pointer is as parameter for
	        intuition.library/MakeClass().

	        class will be NULL in case of failure.

   EXAMPLE
	/* Get a pointer to the superclass. MUI will lock this */
	/* and prevent it from being flushed during you hold   */
	/* the pointer. When you're done, you have to call     */
	/* MUI_FreeClass() to release this lock.               */

	if (!(SuperClass=MUI_GetClass(MUIC_Area)))
	   fail("Superclass for the new class not found.");

	/* Create the new class with the boopsi function call. */
	/* You will need the sizeof your classes instance data */
	/* here.                                               */

	if (!(MyClass=MakeClass(NULL,NULL,SuperClass,sizeof(struct Data),0)))
	@{
	   MUI_FreeClass(SuperClass);
	   fail("Failed to create class.");
	@}

	/* Set the dispatcher for the new class. */

	MyClass->cl_Dispatcher.h_Entry    = (APTR)MyDispatcher;
	MyClass->cl_Dispatcher.h_SubEntry = NULL;

muimaster.library/MUI_NewObjectA             muimaster.library/MUI_NewObjectA

   NAME
	MUI_NewObjectA -- Create an object from a class.
	MUI_NewObject -- Varargs stub for MUI_NewObjectA().

   SYNOPSIS
	object = MUI_NewObjectA( class, tags )
	D0                       A0     A1

	APTR MUI_NewObjectA( char *, struct TagItem * );

	object = MUI_NewObject( classID, Tag1, ... )

	APTR MUI_NewObject( classID, ULONG, ... );

   FUNCTION
	This is the general method of creating objects from MUI classes.
	You specify a class by its ID string. If the class is not
	already in memory or built into muimaster.library, it will be
	loaded using OpenLibrary("mui/%s",0).

	You further specify initial "create-time" attributes for the
	object via a TagItem list, and they are applied to the resulting
	generic data object that is returned. The attributes, their meanings,
	attributes applied only at create-time, and required attributes
	are all defined and documented on a class-by-class basis.

   INPUTS
	classID = the name/ID string of a MUI class, e.g. "Image.mui".
	          Class names are case sensitive!

	tagList = pointer to array of TagItems containing attribute/value
	          pairs to be applied to the object being created.

   RESULT
	A MUI object, which may be used in different contexts such
	as an application, window or gadget, and may be manipulated
	by generic functions. You eventually free the object using
	MUI_DisposeObject().
	NULL indicates failure, more information on the error can be
	obtained with MUI_Error().

muimaster.library/MUI_Redraw                     muimaster.library/MUI_Redraw

   NAME
	MUI_Redraw -- Redraw yourself.

   SYNOPSIS
	MUI_Redraw( obj, flag )
	            A0   D0

	VOID MUI_Redraw( Object *obj, ULONG flag );

   FUNCTION
	With MUI_Redraw(), an object tells itself to refresh, e.g. when
	some internal attributes were changed. Calling MUI_Redraw() is
	only legal within a custom class dispatcher, using this function
	within an applications main part is invalid!

	Most objects graphical representation in a window depends on some
	attributes. A fuel gauge for example would depend on its
	MUIA_Gauge_Current attribute, an animation object would
	depend on MUIA_Animation_CurrentFrame.

	Whenever someone changes such an attribute with a SetAttrs() call,
	the corresponding object receives an OM_SET method with the new
	value. Usually, it could just render itself with some
	graphics.library calls. However, if the object is placed
	in a virtual group or if some other clipping or coordinate
	translation is required, this simple rendering will lead
	into problems.

	That's why MUI offers the MUI_Redraw() function call. Instead
	of drawing directly during OM_SET, you should simply call
	MUI_Redraw(). MUI calculates all necessary coordinates
	and clip regions (in case of virtual groups) and then sends
	a MUIM_Draw method to your object.

	To emphasize this point again: The only time your object is
	allowed to render something is when you receive a MUIM_Draw
	method. Drawing during other methods is illegal.

	Note: As long as no special cases (e.g. virtual groups) are
	      present, MUI_Redraw is very quick and calls your MUIM_Draw
	      method immediately. No coordinate translations or clip
	      regions need to be calculated.

   INPUTS
	obj  - pointer to yourself.
	flag - MADF_DRAWOBJECT or MADF_DRAWUPDATE.
	       The flag given here affects the objects flags when
	       MUI calls the MUIM_Draw method. There are several
	       caveats when implementing MUIM_DRAW, see the
	       developer documentation for details.

   EXAMPLE

	LONG mSet(struct IClass *cl,Object *obj,sruct opSet *msg)
	{
	   struct Data *data = INST_DATA(cl,obj);
	   struct TagItem *tags,*tag;

	   for (tags=msg->ops_AttrList;tag=NextTagItem(&tags);)
	   {

muimaster.library/MUI_RequestA                 muimaster.library/MUI_RequestA

   NAME
	MUI_RequestA  -- Pop up a MUI requester.

   SYNOPSIS
	MUI_RequestA(app,win,flags,title,gadgets,format,params)
	             D0   D1  D2    A0     A1      A2     A3

	LONG MUI_RequestA ( APTR app, APTR win, LONGBITS flags,
	     char *title, char *gadgets, char *format, APTR params );

	LONG MUI_Request ( APTR app, APTR win, LONGBITS flags,
	     char *title, char *gadgets, char *format, ...);

   FUNCTION
	Pop up a MUI requester. Using a MUI requester instead
	of a standard system requester offers you the possibility
	to include text containing all the text engine format codes.

   INPUTS
	app     - The application object. If you leave this
	          NULL, MUI_RequestA() will fall back to a
	          standard system requester.

	win     - Pointer to a window of the application. If
	          this is used, the requester will appear centered
	          relative to this window.

	flags   - For future expansion, must be 0 for now.

	title   - Title for the requester window. Defaults to the
	          name of the application when NULL (and app!=NULL).

	gadgets - Pointer to a string containing the possible answers.
	          The format looks like "_Save|_Use|_Test|_Cancel".
	          If you precede an entry with a '*', this answer will
	          become the active object. Pressing <Return> will
	          terminate the requester with this response. A '_'
	          character indicates the keyboard shortcut for this
	          response.

	format  - A printf-style formatting string.

	params  - Pointer to an array of ULONG containing the parameter
	          values for format.

   RESULT
	0, 1, ..., N = Successive id values, for the gadgets
	you specify for the requester.  NOTE: The numbering
	from left to right is actually: 1, 2, ..., N, 0.

   NAME
 	MUI_RejectIDCMP -- Reject previously requested input events.

   SYNOPSIS
	MUI_RejectIDCMP( obj, flags )
	                  A0   D0

	VOID MUI_RejectIDCMP( Object *obj, ULONG flags );

   FUNCTION
	Reject previously requested input events. You should
	ensure that you reject all input events you requested
	for an object before it gets disposed. Rejecting
	flags that you never requested has no effect.

	Critical flags such as IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE and IDCMP_INTUITICKS
	should be rejected as soon as possible. See MUI_RequestIDCMP()
	for details.

   INPUTS
	obj   - pointer to yourself as an object.
	flags - one or more IDCMP_XXXX flags.

   EXAMPLE
	LONG CleanupMethod(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, Msg msg)
	{
	   MUI_RejectIDCMP( obj, IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS|IDCMP_RAWKEY );
	   return(DoSuperMethodA(cl,obj,msg));

   NAME
 	MUI_RequestIDCMP -- Request input events for your custom class.

   SYNOPSIS
	MUI_RequestIDCMP( obj, flags )
	                  A0   D0

	VOID MUI_RequestIDCMP( Object *obj, ULONG flags );

   FUNCTION
	If your custom class needs to do some input handling, you must
	explicitly request the events you want to receive. You can
	request (and reject) events at any time.

	Whenever an input event you requested arrives at your parent
	windows message port, your object will receive a
	MUIM_HandleInput method.

	Note: Time consuming IDCMP flags such as IDCMP_INTUITICKS and
	      IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE should be handled with care. Too many
	      objects receiving them will degrade performance With
	      the following paragraph in mind, this isn't really
	      a problem:

	      You should try to request critical events only when you
	      really need them and reject them with MUI_RejectIDCMP()
	      as soon as possible. Usually, mouse controlled objects
	      only need MOUSEMOVES and INTUITICKS when a button
	      is pressed. You should request these flags only
	      on demand, i.e. after receiving a mouse down event
	      and reject them immediately after the button has been
	      released.

   INPUTS
	obj   - pointer to yourself as an object.
	flags - one or more IDCMP_XXXX flags.

   EXAMPLE
	LONG SetupMethod(struct IClass *cl, Object *obj, Msg msg)
	{
	   if (!DoSuperMethodA(cl,obj,msg))
	      return(FALSE);

	   /* do some setup here... */
	   ...;

	   /* i need mousebutton events and keyboard */
