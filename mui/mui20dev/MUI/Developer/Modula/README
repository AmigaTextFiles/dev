Modula-Interface for MUI 2.0

MUI (C) 1993/94 by Stefan Stuntz

Modula Interface done by Christian "Kochtopf" Scholz (freeware)
New Version 9.2.1994

Here are the files you need to write MUI-Programs with M2Amiga.
I have also converted some of the Macros defined in mui.h
In this version there are also some macros of my own, so look at MuiMacros!!

Description of the files :

    MuiD.def        : Definitions of MethodIDs, AttributeIDs, etc.
    MuiD.mod        : Some additional PROCEDUREs for some #define's in mui.h
    MuiL.def        : The interface for muimaster.library
    MuiSupport.def  : Additional PROCEDUREs like DoMethod or fail.
    MuiSupport.mod  : The implementation of these PROCEDUREs.
    MuiMacros.def   : Some Macros converted from mui.h
    MuiMacros.mod   : The implementation of these.
    MuiClasses.def  : some things you need to write own classes
    MuiTest.mod     : A sample Module showing how to use the interface.
    ListDemo.mod    : A sample Listview programm showing an DisplayHook!

    In this version you have to compile the interface yourself.
    For this can you use the CompilerScript. It will compile the
    interface and copy the files to m2:modules/sym|obj.


The History :

22.10.1993 MuiSupport : changed fail-PROCEDURE, that it makes no use of
                        Terminal, but now uses Arts.Requester.
           MuiMacros  : Added macros AddMember, DelMember, MakeHook,
                        MakeID, PopUp
26.10.1993 supplied CompilerScript
9.2.1994   MuiD       : Updates to 1.5 (Popasl, Popstring, PopObject... )
                        added mPaletteEntry, mScrmodelist.
           MuiL       : Updates to 1.5 (Custom Class Functions)
                        changed return-value of mAslRequest to BOOLEAN 
                                                (thanx to Thilo Stoeferle)
                        provided muiMasterVersion, etc. like System-Defs.
           MuiSupport : fail will set app to NIL, now VAR-parameter 
                        (so you can use it in a CLOSE-Routine)
                                                (thanx to Martin Koyro)
           MuiMacros  : now it supports StrPtr instead of ARRAY OF CHAR.
                        set the symbol Locale to TRUE to get it. (defaults to FALSE)
                        added some macros by Martin Koyro (KeyRadio, (Key)Cycle, (Key)Slider)
           MuiClasses : new Module which implements things to write own classes.
           ComboBox   : removed - use PopObject for a Popup-List.
           ListDemo   : New Demo to show how to do lists.



Note :

Again the new features are not really tested, because i had not so much
time for it to do. So again, please contact me if you have suggestions
what to do better :-)
