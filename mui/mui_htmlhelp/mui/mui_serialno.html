Old MUI serial numbers were composed of 4 digits with the first one
describing the registration site where the key came from. New serial
numbers are calculated as a checksum from address data. Unfortunately, I
forget that this new checksum doesnt fit into 16 bits anymore, so the
tag value calculation fails. If you've got a new serial number and need
tag values for public custom classes, please ask Klaus Melchior
(kmel@eifel.tng.oche.de).

If everybody uses the <<16 scheme with his (old) serial number in public
and private custom classes, there wont be any conflicts. Tag values that
start with oldsernumber<<16 are always reserved for the owner of this
serial number.

Only people without an old serial number need to apply for a reserved
value which will be chosen in a way that it doesnt conflict with other
old serial numbers.

In any case, authors of public custom classes must register the name of
their class before release. Furthermore, please ask here before starting
to work on something. Altough there are only very few custom classes at
the moment, we are already starting to get dupes.
