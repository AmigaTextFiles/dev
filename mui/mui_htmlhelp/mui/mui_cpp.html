As I wrote above. It is really easy to write a C++-Class for
a single MUI-Class wich is derived from i.e. Area. But you need
a lot more. In a MUI C++-Class-library you need Con- and Destructors
wich Creates the classes and Objects (Constructors) and dispose
the objects and delete the classes (Destructors). And the destructors
have to decide wether they are allowed to dispose the objects and
to delete the classes.

I am working on such a class-library. But it is not ready now.

Ciao, Willi

Hmm... I'm not sure I can see how you can make a C++ interface to MUI
that uses C++'s inheritance (rather than BOOPSI's) without some
problems. Any custom class written in C++ (using C++'s inheritance and
method interface) would not be useable with another language, unlike a
custom class written to use BOOPSI (in any language).

I've seen a similar approach taken with Microsoft's Foundation
Classes. From what I've seen, they present an apparent C++ interface
to the outside world, but internally they use a mechanism very similar
to BOOPSI (ie. passing around ID's, etc) so you can still use the
classes without requiring C++. Any custom class that used C++'s
mechanisms, however, could only ever be used by someone using C++.

Still, I'll be curious to see the results. Perhaps I've completely
overlooked something. :-)
