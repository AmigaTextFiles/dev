I've the question to Stefan Stuntz.  MUI_PenSpec structure is called "black
box" in includes, but it seems to contain the same string which I can type
as MUIA_Image_Spec.  Do you guaranty that it won't change in the future
releases of MUI?  Can I call

  MUI_ObtainPen(muiRenderInfo(obj), "2:00000000,ffffffff,00000000", NULL);

and be sure that it will work with all versions of MUI?  If yes, it would
be great, since I'd be able to obtain pens even under OS2.
