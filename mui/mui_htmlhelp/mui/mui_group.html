It would not. You can simply have an invisible page of a page group
somewhere which holds the objects you remove somewhere else.

You can only show/hide complete rows/columns. Hiding one child of a
row/column hides the complete row/column. Furthermore, MUIA_ShowMe has a
few other problems sometimes that have not been solved yet.

Removing/adding is *always* the better choice. And whats so slow with
it? Are you writing a 30 fps megademo? :)

Even an 68k machine should be able to do 30 AddTail(list,node)s in
no-time.

InitChange/ExitChange during setup/cleanup is not a good idea. You
should add your childs in MUIM_Setup *before* the DoSuperMethod() and
remove your childs in MUIM_Cleanup *after* the DoSuperMethod().

If I remember correctly, I told you *not* to use InitChange/ExitChange
in a setup method after DSM and in a cleanup method before DSM.

One shouldnt disable groups anyway just to disable its children. Better
disable each child for itself, since this will indeed look nicer. You can
do this with one DoMethod, e.g. MUIM_MultiSet or MUIM_SetUData.

MUIA_ShowMe currently suxx big deal and I can only suggest
not to use it. Better add/remove your objects dynamically
with ADDMEMBER/REMMEMBER InitChange/ExitChange.

Yes. You can use this:

#define MUIM_Group_Sort 0x80427417 /* V4 */

on groups just like MUIM_Family_Sort on families.

Hi there !

Lately I have used a bit of Tcl/Tk at university, and what struck me as 
somewhat impossible to do in the current MUI release was the way popup 
menus where handled. It is impossible to do a nice popup menu class that 
could be bound to some hotkey or mousebutton and some specific object, 
for example, a listview... Ok, there _are_ context-sensitive menus, but 
you won't have them on the listview if you haven't some patch installed, 
and even then there's still the anoying menu title there, even if it is 
only a single menu.

A bit off-topic: It isn't possible to do anything else than GUI-Elements 
as custom groups. Ok, this might be a bit beyond the scope of MUI, but 
imagine there would be some Network object that could provide an 
object-oriented abstraction from Socket-IO, as well as provide 
notifications and the like...

But I was just thinking away...

Regards, Hans-Joerg.

The next MUI-release will handle context-menus in a different way and
should be exactly how you want it.

Um, you can do this fine with MUI, just derive from Notify... =
think
someone is working on a between-machine method calling mechanism,
I certainly use plain old BOOPSI for all my Streams classes, =
LinkedLists,
Mutable Strings etc.

Derive a Group (virtual or otherwise) with it's own custom layout =
hook
and make the objects of that group Draggable; when you get a drop =
event,
re-layout the group (force this using MUIM_Group_InitChange =
followed by
ExitChange) it should actually be relatively simple... (heh!)

Have a look at the Layout example code to get started.

Drag&Drop combined with a custom layout-hook should do the trick.
