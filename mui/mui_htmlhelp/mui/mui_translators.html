  That's kewl. So now we'd have Bali, Klingon and Latin. Some more
really exclusive language- and catalog files?

  What about reprogramming the amiga's time system sometime,
making it possible to have "mars days" and "mars years" and things
like that (as anybody knows on other planets years, days and, if
they got moons, months have different lengths as on earth)

  What about setting up a homearea of exclusive amiga localizations
in the www? If anybody wants to join this project with his or her
country, .language and .catalog files, contact me at
"raver@cube.net" subject "Localize". If this project will succeed,
noone will have to search for exclusive languages, (s)he will only
need to go to the homepage of "Localize" and hopefully either find
Bali, Klingon, Latin, Suomi etc. directly on that page or at least
a link on the homepage of that localization.

I made a Latin language file some time ago, although it's not quite
complete. If somebody is interested in it, I could mail them the source
(assembler).

I can do a Norwegian for you.

And this got me thinking: Someone ought to organise a way for programmers
to have their software translated, say a group of people dedicated to
seeing software in their native languages, willing to translate whatever is
thrown in their direction, and most importantly can be easily reached.
Anyone willing to undertake such a project? Or even better, does anyone
know if such a thing already exists?

I have had *exactly* the same idea. Problem is here in Denmark that many translators
literally can't spell and do not know how to make the app-translation follow the same
principles as Commodore once made. However, I haven't done anything about it yet.

I have got some megs of homepage-space. Perhaps some of it can be devoted to a
translation-organisation. I have already made an "Amiga Homepage DK" (however, it's not
*the* official Danish homapage :) ), so this would fit in good.

The way I thought it ought to work was that some people from every country could take
care of "their translators", i.e. all the translators from their country, and correct
the small errors that inevitably appear sometimes. They should also set up some
guidelines for the translation (the amount of English jargon needed etc.). And last,
but not least, they *must* inform their translators if they think their translations
are crap! We all want the Amiga to look professional, right?

BTW: What should this organization be called? Amiga Translators International (ATI)?
International Amiga Translators Organization (IATO)? And what about a motto? Can we
take money (for our expenses *only*) for translations of shareware and commercial
software?

To all persons willing to help in starting this project: Please write back (either to
the mailing list or to my personal address).

Well, I'm writing a program(mui based!) to reduce the amount of time needed to localize a program.
It can scan the sources, extract the IDs and build locale handling source code, cd and ct files(not exactly, I use a different format) and catalogs. It can compare the last version of the cd file with the new one and tell the programmer what has changed, something similar happens for ct files. I think all this stuff makes localization a lot faster(and less boring ;), with, maybe, a auto mailing feature of new cd files(arexx?), it could solve the problem. We could build a list of available translators and maybe we could post it on Aminet; a translators' home page could be useful too.
Just add the list in th eprogram's notebook, select the translators and mail the file!
What do you think about it?

Note: I'm available for any kind of translation in Italian.

I've done this for french language a long time ago. The project is named
"LignesdeGuide" (lines of guide), and a first beta version is available
more or less confidentially.

Eric Totel (MUIBuilder) is among those who have it, since we handled
commercial translations together. I wonder if he still reads this list...

For shareware translation, a free license/keyfile seems fair. For commercial
one, it is my opinion (and experience too) that the considerable amount of
work required (not only catalogs and online help but installation scripts,
printed manuals, register card, disk labels, and so many details) deserves
some money.

A translation page is scheduled on my own Web site. Only the french part is
available for now. The english one should appear this week. Please check

  http://www.imaginet.fr/~yeproy/amiga/ (french)
  http://www.imaginet.fr/~yeproy/amiga/index_e.html (english)

I will put there the last version of LignesDeGuide. There's some english
documentation in it.

>|* Danish translator on YAM, MonthNavigator.MCC, Miami, and MailText.MCC.

I've done TDS, GuruROM, Wordworth 4SE, Personal Suite and I'm currently
working on RDB-Salv (Angela Schmidt's last project).


Regards,

Yann

    It's VERY important.  I often see very bad french translation of catalogs. 
Translators must do their job with guidelines, to keep some uniformity between
program's vocabulary, to standardize expressions.

    Can I get this document, Yann?  I'm a french canadian translator, and I'm
interested to read this.

    I'm interested to help has an English-To-French translator for the Québec
(Quebec) province of Canada (Yes!  We are 8 million french speakers here, in
North-America!).

    Maybe it would be interesting for developpers to create in such Local
Organisation's Web page an index for languages and sub-indexes for
translators, with a list for their achievement and e-mail address.

    For each language sub-pages, It woulb be important to keep a guidelines
document for translators too.

    But how can we control the translation quality?  Elect a responible for
each language?  Create locale mailing-list?

Agree.

Well, I wouldn't mind it, problem is that I haven't got *that* much time from now on
and about a month again. But if you would like me to do it, I will!

BTW: Look at this homepage:

www2.dk-online.dk/users/Ole_Friis_Ostergaard/TRANS/TRANS.HTM

to see what I had in thought. Besides what is mentioned there, each "country chief"
(can anyone find a better synonym please! :) ) should cater for "his" translators with
a homepage with translation guidelines, contacts etc. Please comment my ideas!
