I wouldn't call it a bug, but you're right, it appears to be
undocumented. The reason for not calling it a bug is because it's
consistent with the behaviour of other attributes which take a string
pointer -- AFAIK, none of them make local copies (probably for
performance/memory reasons) and require you to keep a static string if
you want it retained.
