   DESCRIPTION
	MonthNavigator is a Custom Class of the Magic User Interface =A9 by
	Stefan Stuntz.
	It's a subclass of group-class.

	The idea of this class was born during developing my Gregor
	application.

	MUI public custom class showing a field with the days of a specified
	month in a specified year.
	The user decides if the names of the weekdays and the numbers of the
	weeks will be shown. Also it is possible for the user to set which
	weekday should be the day on which a week was started - the language
	for the weekday names can also be chosen.
	A special feature of this class is, that it correctly handles
	October 1582. In this months the days 5-14 didn't exist, because they
	were removed by the Gregorian calendar reform. This calendar reform
	happens in different years for different countries, so the user can
	set his country with the user preferences.

	date.library >=3D 33.182 (included)
