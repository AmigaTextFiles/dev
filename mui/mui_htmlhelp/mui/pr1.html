I think this is mostly the case for pictures. For example WebMaker has some
custom pictures for its buttons, and after the program has terminated the
picture files are still locked. I don't know exactly if this is a fault of MUI
or if it is WebMakers fault, but I noticed such errors very often when MUI
programs used own pictures.

Why should I stop it, just when I begin hating it?
