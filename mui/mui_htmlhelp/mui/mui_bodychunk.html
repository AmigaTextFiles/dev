Hello everybody,

I'm currently working on a GUI with many Bitmap/BodyChunk  objects. Many
times, some objects must have the same image. Is it possible to share
BodyChunk_Body between objects ? When these objects are drawn on a screen
with differents colors, does each object store a remapped body for itself ?

More generaly speaking, what are the memory (FAST & CHIP) usage of these
objects ?

Thanks.

Denis GALIANA

Body data may be shared between different Bodychunk objects
and does not need to be in chip ram.
