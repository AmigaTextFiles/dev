The datatype object used for listitem graphics wasn't disposed properly.

If a definition-data block (DD) starts with a paragraph (P) then no extra space is added.

· Rudi Chiarito <chiarito@cli.di.unipi.it>


MUIM_HTMLview_GotoURL was invoked twice for frames.

@Node Bugs "HTMLview / Bugs"


@{_Section "Bugs"}
@{LIndent 2}

@{FG Highlight}I'm aware of the following problems@{FG Text}
@{LIndent 5}


If a document doesn't contain a BODY element, then nothing is displayed.

Each HTMLview instance require a signal bit, so when browsing frames, it may run out of them. This results in empty/useless frames, and/or sometimes images aren't loaded.

The datatype.decoder only works with the V43 picture.datatype by Olaf Barthel.


@{LIndent 2}

If you find any other bugs, please let me know. However, if it's related to the display of some HTML page, then please first verify that the page actually contain proper HTML. I can recommend getting `tidy' (from Aminet) to do so.

I'm currently working on stylesheets, and a friend of mine will probably do a javascript interpreter.

The stylesheet version will use bullet.library directly (i.e. for truetype fonts), it is also based on a much faster parser (currently 5-10 times)
