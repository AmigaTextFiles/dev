@node Intro "Introduction"

   @{u}Introduction@{uu}

  This class provides you with an easy way to present hexadecimal dump of a
memory  region  to  the user.  Additionally, memory contents are visible in
ASCII representation.  Editing in both modes is possible.  HexEdit class is
very  flexible,  with  many  settable  parameters and some critical methods
(like byte reading and writing) waiting to be overloaded.

@node Licence "Licence"

   @{u}Licence@{uu}

  Authors  of freeware/PD programs can use this class for free.  All others
(including  shareware/commercial authors) should @{" contact me " link Credits} to obtain the
licence.   The  licence  is  rather cheap, in most cases its cost equals to
shareware  fee  you  are going to ask for your program.  For very expensive
and/or low-volume programs price can be negotiated individually.

  There are problems when you select a font which is too big for HexEdit
