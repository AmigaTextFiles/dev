  Many programs on other operating systems often offer so called
  "Tip of the day" stickers. It's mostly small window opened on
  program startup, showing valuable (more or less) information about
  the program, some useful information, keyboard shortcuts or just
  neat tips or quick how-to solutions...

  I think, that from the user's point of view it's good idea to have
  such feature, especially Tips can be turned off if you felt bored.
  As you probably guessed, this class is supposed to handle such
  tips for your MUI based application. See the enclosed demonstration
  for more details.

  You like the class? Feel free to use it in your programs.

Tipwindow.mcc/Technical notes

  Tips are stored in IFF file. The structure of the file is
  rather simple:

    chunk  'MAX ' holds total number of tips present in the file
    chunks '0000' till 'ffff' (note case IS important!) holds
           all the tip texts.

  Tips converter takes plain ASCII file as input and writes each
  line as separate tip. To support multiline tips, converter handles
  all these backslashed (e.g. "\n") characters, and converts them
  properly. It also handles hex/dec/oct/bin numbers (e.g. \033), so
  you can use all MUI text formatting sequences like \033b to have
  text boldfaced, \033u to have it underlined etc.

  Since release 15.1, Tipboard supports localized tips. According to
  your system settings, the following locations will be checked against
  valid tips database

      PROGDIR:Tips/$language/filebase.tips
      PROGDIR:Catalogs/$language/filebase.tips
      LOCALE:Catalogs/$language/filebase.tips
      LOCALE:Tips/$language/filebase.tips
      LOCALE:$language_filebase.tips
      PROGDIR:Tips/$language_filebase.tips
      PROGDIR:Tips/english/filebase.tips
      PROGDIR:Tips/filebase.tips
	  PROGDIR:filebase.tips

  where $language is your current system language (e.g. "english",
  "polski", "deutsch" etc). File base meaning is described in the
  MUIA_Tip_FileBase chapter.

  Class private data (".tipc" file) is always stored in 
  PROGDIR:filebase.tipc file

  To allow user snapshot the TipOfTheDay window (size/position etc),
  the window uses own window ID = 'TODD'. I don't expect it would
  ever collide with your application window ID's, but in case
  I am wrong, you can always set your own ID at object creation
  time to override default one (Tipwindow.mcc is a subclass of
  the window class)

Tipwindow.mcc/MUIA_Tip_FileBase

    NAME
        MUIA_Tip_FileBase -- [ISG], char *   v15

    FUNCTION
        Specifies custom file base (root name) for all Tip related
        files this class uses. The file base it copied into
        internal buffer (which can hold up to 256 characters).

    NOTE:
        If you don't specify your own file base, Tip class will
        try to find out it by itself, by quering your Applicaiton
        object for MUIA_Application_Base, and if fail, for
        MUIA_Application_Title. To avoid problems on multiple instances 
        of your program, the class will strip any dot suffix of your
        application base found in range of 4 characters starting
        from the end of the name (e.g. "MyApp.3" will result in
        "MyApp", but "My.Program" will result in "My.Program").
        Unfortunately, MUIA_Application_SingleTask is not gettable
        recently, so better don't use dotted base names (e.g. base
        name like "My.App" will cause problems as it will be taken
        as "My" filebase).

        If you need custom value, it appears wise to specify this
        attribute on object creation time, and to keep it untouched
        later on.

    FILES
        Tips of the day are stored in the database which name
        is built based on the FileBase attribute and the
        ".tips" suffix. Class settings ("show tips on startup")
        and other data are kept in ".tipc" file in your app's home
        directory. The ".tipc" file is created when the class is going
        to be disposed (OM_DISPOSE), to avoid unnecessary I/O accesses.
        But when the state of "show tips on startup" checkmark change
        (e.g. due to user's action) the ".tipc" file is written
        immidiately.

        
    EXAMPLE
		set(obj, MUIA_Tip_FileBase, "myapp");

        the class will be then looking for "myapp.tips" database,
        and will keep own data in "myapp.tipc" file.

Tipwindow.mcc/MUIA_Tip_WindowObject

    NAME
        MUIA_Tip_WindowObject -- [..G], char *   v15

    FUNCTION
        Returns pointer to internal MUI window object being used 
        by the instance of TOD class.

    NOTE
        Getting pointer to the window object gives you the ability
        to play with all Window class atributes/methods directly:
        you can set custom titles, make window borderless, force
        certain position etc. But I strongly recommend you to resist
        doing other things than setting custom window title. MUI
        power is (among the engine) its user-configurability, so
        avoid override too much, 

    IMPORTANT
        This attribute appeared in version 15.8, so it's strongly
        recommended to check what you've obtained, otherwise
        you may badly nuke by writing at random address.

        
    EXAMPLE
        get(obj, MUIA_Tip_WindowObject, &tip_win);
        if( tip_win )
           set(tip_win, MUIA_Window_Title, "Custom titles rocks!");

Tipwindow.mcc/MUIA_Tip_BulbObject

    NAME
        MUIA_Tip_BulbObject -- [I..], char *   v15

    FUNCTION
        Let's you customize the look of bulb image. Just create
        your own Bodychunk Object and pass its pointer to the
        TOD class on creation time. It's safe to pass NULL
        as the argument (in that case default bulb will be
        used)

    EXAMPLE

Tipwindow.mcc/MUIM_Tip_GoHomePage

    NAME
        MUIM_Tip_GoHomePage          v15

    FUNCTION
        If there's OpenURL.library installed and properly
        configured, this method should order your favourite
        browser to visit TipOfTheDay class' homepage. This method
        is called when user click on the bulb image (this is
        hidden feature ;-)
        
    EXAMPLE
		DoMethod(obj, MUIM_Tip_GoHomePage );

    SEE ALSO

Tipwindow.mcc/MUIA_Tip_Show

    NAME
        MUIM_Tip_Show      v15

        DoMethod(obj, MUIM_Tip_Show, Flags );


    FUNCTION
        Shows Tip of the day. If called sequently, will show
        next tip each time. Tips never ends (when showing forward,
        1st one will be shown after last, or vice versa when showing
        tips backwards)

	FLAGS
        MUIV_Tip_Show_Startup
        MUIV_Tip_Show_Next
        MUIV_Tip_Show_Prev
        MUIV_Tip_Show_Random

    NOTE: When MUIV_Tip_Show_Next, Prev or Random are used,
          the Tip window will pop up, no matter what the state of
          "show tip on startup" is.  MUIV_Tip_Show_Startup is
          almost the same as MUIV_Tip_Show_Next, but it takes
          care of user will (stored in ".tipc" file). It's
          recommended to use this flag when you show tips on
          startup, but also to have menu item (like "Show tip of
          the day...") that will call this method with
          MUIV_Tip_Show_Next, to allow user to change his mind
          (or to read more tips w/o forcing him to restart your
          application which'd be totally lame ;-)

    EXAMPLE
		DoMethod( obj, MUIA_Tip_Show, MUIV_Tip_Show_Startup );
