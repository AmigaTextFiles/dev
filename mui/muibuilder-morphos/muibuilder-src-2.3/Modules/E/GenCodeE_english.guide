@NODE introduction "Introduction"
    Starting from this release, the Amiga E versions which are older
than 3.1a one are no longer supported.

   NOTE : You must have the mui23Edev.lha archive to be able to use
GenCodeE, and you are strongly advised (but it isn't an obligation) to
get too the fabulous FlexCat and AutoBuild. All these programs are
available on aminet and probably also in all the good freely
distribuable software collections.

@NODE code_généré "Generated code"
    The code generated by GenCodeE is now too complex to be explained
simply. So, I chose an example (a significant one) to expose it
rather than long (and difficult) explainations. Begin by watching in
MUIBuilder how is defined the example application DemoGenCodeE,
especially for notifications. After, look at the generated code and
above all the main source DemoGenCode.em in which I put a lot of
comments. Make after some experiments with modifications of
DemoGenCodeE definition in MUIBuilder to see how the code generator
behaves. Try too the different generation options : declarations,
code, notifications, environment and locale. I think that this will be
enough for everybody to understand how GenCodeE is behaving. If
however you meet problems, write to me (see the @{"author" link auteur}).

    DemoGenCodeE has only one window. Inside this one, you can see a
'Click' group and a 'Quit' button. I let you guess what is the effect
of this last one... In the 'Click' group, you can see 4 buttons and a
text gadget. When you click on one of the buttons, this changes the
text gadget contents each time in a different way :
    - the 'Put Constant String' button modifies the text gadget
contents by a notification which directly put in a constant string
    - the 'Put Variable' button modifies the text gadget contents by a
notification which directly put in a variable contents
    - the 'Return ID' button returns an ID (after a click on this
button) when the MUIM_Application_Input method is called, and in this
case, the text gadget contents is modified by a set() call
    - the 'Call Hook' button calls for each click on this button a
hook function which modifies the text gadget contents
    DemoGenCodeE also offers an ARexx command "change_text" which
modifies too the text gadget contents.
    All these cases cover all the differents codes that can be
generated by GenCodeE.
