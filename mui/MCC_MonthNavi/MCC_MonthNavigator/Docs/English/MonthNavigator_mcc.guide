Description
-----------

MonthNavigator is a Custom Class of the Magic User Interface © by Stefan Stuntz. It is a subclass of group-class and Date.mcc.

The idea of this class was born during developing my Gregor application.

@{"MUI" link MUIReadMe} public custom class showing a field with the days of a specified month in a specified year. The user decides if the names of the weekdays and the weeknumbers will be shown. Also it is possible for the user to set which weekday should be the day on which a week was started - the language for the weekday names can also be chosen.
A special feature of this class is, that it correctly handles October 1582. In this month the days 5-14 didn't exist, because they were removed by the Gregorian calendar reform. This calendar reform happens in different years for different countries, so the user can set his country with the user preferences.

Users can change the display of MonthNavigator with the following features:
- Show/Hide names of the weekdays
- Select name of weekday with which a week starts
- Select the language to use for the names of weekdays (out of 28)
- Show/Hide weeknumbers
- Select the country for the Gregorian calendar reform (not to be used as long
  as the date.library has not fully implemented this feature)
- Set the distance between the day-field and the names of weekdays/weeknumbers
- Fix the day-field to 6 rows
- Use frames for day-fields
- Show/Hide unused day-fields
- Display the last/first days of the previous/next month within the unused
  day-fields.
- Define how days of the previous/next month should be highlighted.
- Define how the internal 'mark today' hook should highlight today.
- Choose between american or European layout.

MonthNavigator supports also the following features which might be of interest for developers:
- Based on Date.mcc
- Dropping a date-object onto a MonthNavigator will set this date as the
  actual one
- Objects can be dropped onto the days
- Days can be dragged around
- Days can be marked by changing the following attributes:
  * MUIA_Text_PreParse
  * MUIA_Background
  * MUI_ShortHelp
  * MUIA_Disabled
- Supporting MUIM_Import and MUIM_Export
- Dates can be correctly selected from 0008-01-01 to 8000-12-31 by using the
  DateLib (TM)

The MonthNavigator also supports three input modes: read-only, relverify and  the immediate mode.

Installation
------------

Only use the installer script!
(The Installer must be in your system-path!)

If you use an Installer prior to V42 you should set the LANGUAGE Tooltype to your language. Installer V42 and better automatically use your current locale.


Please note that the installer-script is very special, because:

- It features uninstallation
- It is automated
- It is very flexible
- It is very intelligent (for an installer-script ;-)
- It uses @{"WrapGuide" link WrapGuide} (if present) for the @{AmigaGuide}
  documentation if running under a pre V39 system.
- It can be reused by (hopefully) all other MUI custom classes, because the
  authors of custom classes need to only change a few things:

  * The #copyright variable
  * The #min_os_version and #min_os_revision variables
  * The #min_mui_version and #min_mui_revision variables
  * The #language_mcc and #language_mcp variables
  * The P_CustomExists, P_CustomInstall and P_CustomUninstall procedures
  * The 'APPNAME' tooltype within the MCC-Install icon.

Preferences
-----------

With the preferences you can customize the MonthNavigator as follows:

- Weekdays
  * Show names of weekdays
    With this option you can show or hide the names of weekdays that will be
    displayed above the day-field.
  * First weekday
    This option defines which weekday is the first of a week. Normally this
    will be Monday or Sunday, but you can choose any weekday!
    Setting 'locale' means to use the preference from the locale.library.
  * Language
    Here you can define the language that should be used for the names of
    the weekdays. Using the locale.library settings here would be enough.

- Weeknumbers
  * Show weeknumbers
    With this option you can show or hide the number of weeks that will be
    displayed on the left side of the day-field.

- Country support
  * Country
    Here you can select the country to use for the Gregorian calendar reform.
    This reform happens at different times within different countries!
    The days that were removed from the calendar will be displayed below
    the cycle gadget.
    This setting is disabled as long as the DateLib (TM) does not fully
    implement the country handling for the Gregorian calendar reform.

- Spacing
  * Names of weekdays
    Here you can change the space (1-18 pixel) that will be displayed between
    the names of weekdays and the day-field.
    Enabling the checkmark beside the slider means that a line should be drawn
    between the names of weekdays and the day-field.
    'Show names of weekdays' must be enabled to change these options.

  * Weeknumbers
    Here you can change the space (1-18 pixel) that will be displayed between
    the number of weeks and the day-field.
    Enabling the checkmark beside the slider means that a line should be drawn
    between the number of weeks and the day-field.
    'Show number of weeks' must be enabled to change these options.

- Frames & fields
  * Layout
    You can choose between the american (default) layout and the by 90 degrees
    turned european one.
  * Fixed to 6 rows
    The day-field is by default of dynamic high - with this option it will
    be fixed to a high of 6 rows.
  * Use frames
    This options tells MonthNavigator not to use frames around the day-field,
    the names of weekdays and the number of weeks.
    Works only for read-only displays!
  * Show invisible fields
    The day-fields before the first day in a month and after the last day of
    a month are mostly empty. This option now displays these empty fields
    in a button alike style.
  * Use last/next days
    When you enable the 'show invisible fields' option you can define if
    the normally unused day-fields should only look like buttons or if
    they should be real buttons with the days of the previous/next month.
    Using 'fillup-only' here means that only empty fields will be used for the
    days of the previous/next month. Using 'yes' will display an extra
    day-field line when the first/last line of the month is completely filled.

- Highlight prev/next month days
  'Show invisible fields' must be enabled if you want to change something on
  this page.
  * Underline
    Underline the days of the previous/next month.
  * Bold
    Set the days of the previous/next month in bold style.
  * Italic
    Set the days of the previous/next month in italic style.
    Please have a look at the @{"Known problems" link Problems} section before
    using this option!

Localization
------------

The MonthNavigator.mcc custom class uses the date.library, which supports 28 languages for the moment.

The date.library also supports the following countries for the moment:
Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Netherlands, Great Britain

If you want your country to be supported, I need the exact days that where removed from the calendar by the Gregorian calendar reform.
Pope Gregor XVIII removed the days 5.10.1582-14.10.1582 from the calendar, but this reform happened at different times in different countries.

Btw. you will find the catalog to translate in the archiv under
Locale/catalogs/MonthNavigator_mcp.ct
and if possible please also translate the installer script strings.

PLEASE DON'T UPLOAD TRANSLATIONS TO AMINET, SEND THEM DIRECTLY TO ME SO THAT I CAN INCLUDE THEM INTO THE NEXT RELEASE!

@NODE Developer "Developer Information"
@KEYWORDS "Developer"

Information for Developers
--------------------------

There is no multiple inheritance for Boopsi/MUI for the moment, so we haven't any chance to create a real Date basis-class. But there is another way to have the same result (compatibility for all classes that are dealing with dates).
The solution is called interface inheritance like it was done with IDL for CORBA.
MonthNavigator.mcc inherits the interface from Date.mcc!


Btw. it would be wise to use a

 SetAttrs(obj,
            MUIA_Date_Year,  year,
            MUIA_Date_Month, month,
            MUIA_Date_Day,   day,
          TAG_DONE
         );

instead of single set()'s.


- The following attributes are filtered out, so that they can't bring
  a MonthNavigator object into trouble:
  MUIA_Group_ActivePage, MUIA_Group_Child, MUIA_Group_ChildList,
  MUIA_Group_Horiz, MUIA_Group_HorizSpacing, MUIA_Group_LayoutHook,
  MUIA_Group_PageMode, MUIA_Group_Rows, MUIA_Group_SameHeight,
  MUIA_Group_SameSize, MUIA_Group_SameWidth, MUIA_Group_Spacing,
  MUIA_Group_VertSpacing, MUIA_ControlChar, MUIA_CycleChain, MUIA_FillArea,
  MUIA_FixHeight, MUIA_FixHeightTxt, MUIA_FixWidth, MUIA_FixWidthTxt,
  MUIA_FramePhantomHoriz, MUIA_InputMode, MUIA_MaxHeight, MUIA_MaxWidth,
  MUIA_Selected, MUIA_ShowSelState

- MUIA_CycleChain be forwared to the buttons

- During a DragQuery, DragDrop etc. you can only ask the source object for
  the following MonthNavigator attributes:
  MUIA_MonthNavigator_Day, MUIA_MonthNavigator_Month, MUIA_MonthNavigator_Year

- Using the automatic Drag&Drop mode, a Drag frame will appear when you are
  pressing a day-button.

- When MUIA_ObjectID is defined a MonthNavigator object will load/save the
  following data during MUIM_Application_Load/MUIM_Application_Save
  Day, Month, Year

Known problems
--------------

- I heard that using 'test' and then 'cancel' the test settings within the
  MUI preference manager will not work as expected when using your MUI
  classes within Libs:MUI/ instead of MUI:Libs/MUI/ !!!

- Dragging is not possible if the MonthNavigator object is in immediate
  mode and if you only have enabled the Automatic drag mode in the
  preferences!

- If you set the preferences for days of previous/next month or highlight
  today to italic and right alignment then a digit of a day-number disapears.

- Old versions of the program called 'PhoneCost' written by André Schenk
  <schenkae@tick.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de> installed another
  'date.library' into 'Libs:'.
