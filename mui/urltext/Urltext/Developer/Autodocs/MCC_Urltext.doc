Urltext.mcc is a subclass of Area.mui and offers a very simple text
that acts like an active url, as a html link in a browser. Urltext
is expecially useful in About windows. When the user clicks an Urltext
object, openurl.library is used to reach the url. Urltext.mcc may be
configured in MUI configuration window to adjust colors and other
defaults.

Urltext.mcc uses OpenURL system wich is copyright by Troels Walsted Hansen.

Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_Active

   NAME
    MUIA_Urltext_Active -- [..G.], BOOL

   FUNCTION
    Urltext.mcc needs openurl.library installed and configured
    to work. This attribute is set to 1 if OpenURL in installed
    in the system, to 0 otherwise.

Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_DoOpenURL

   NAME
    MUIA_Urltext_DoOpenURL -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
    If this attribute is set to 1 (default), the url is reached when
    the user clicks the object. If it is set to 0, nothing happens
    if the user clicks the object.

Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_DoVisitedPen

   NAME
    MUIA_Urltext_DoVisitedPen -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
    At creation time this attribute may be set to determinate how
    the text is drawn after the user clicked the object.
    In Urltext preferences, the user may define a color to be used
    to draw the text after the object was clicked.
    If this attribute is set to 1 (default), that color is used.

    Note that this attribute overwrites the user preferences and
    therefore it should be used sparerly.

Urltext.mcc/MUIA_Urltext_FallBack

   NAME
    MUIA_Urltext_Fallback -- [I...], BOOL

   FUNCTION
    At creation time this attribute may be set to determinate how
    the text is drawn if OpenURL is not installed in the system.
    If OpenURL is installed in the system, this attribute is not
    used. If OpenURL is not installed in the system and
    MUIA_Urltext_Fallback is 0, the text is drawn with MUI Text
    pen and the object is not active. If OpenURL is not installed
    in the system and MUIA_Urltext_Fallback is 1, the text is drawn
    as OpenURL was installed and the object is active (but nothing
    happens if the user clicks on it).

    Note that this attribute overwrites the user preferences and
    therefore it should be used sparerly.
