@node INTRODUCTION "Introduction"

                                  @{b}Introduction@{ub}

    TWFmultiLED is a fairly simple implementation of a "LED-like" indicator
which provides the programmer with a new method for communicating program
state to the user. Unlike other similar implementations, TWFmultiLED allows
both the user and programmer to specify both the shape of the indicator and
it's colour.

    Via the preferences program the user can specify the RGB makeup of the 6
internal colours (used to represent the states "Off", "On", "Ok", "Loading",
"Error" and "Panic") and the default shape of the indicator. The programmer
can abide by the user's choice of shape, or override it and use one of the
other shapes. The programmer can also set the indicator to any of the 6 user
defined colours or to a custom colour the programmer specifies.

@node FEATURES "Features"

    The best way to get an idea of the capabilities of TWFmultiLED is to
try the demo program or download StartPanel from my website. TWFmultiLED's
features include:

    - 10 user definable "preset" colours.
    - 1 programmer definable colour (specified by RGB value)
    - 6 possible shapes:

           5 pixel diameter circle
          11 pixel diameter circle
         5x5 square
       11x11 square
        11x5 rectangle
       13x11 rectangle

    - Shape can be set by the user or, if required, by the programmer.
    - Automatic turn off after user/ programmer definable delay period.

@node INSTALLING "Installing"

    To install TWFmultiLED you can either use the supplied MCC-Install script
or you can install the class by hand by copying the contents of the libs/
directory to MUI:libs/mui/

    If you are a developer and you want to use the class, copy the developer
materials to their respective locations. Developers must inform me if they
are using this class to ensure they get any news/ updates!
