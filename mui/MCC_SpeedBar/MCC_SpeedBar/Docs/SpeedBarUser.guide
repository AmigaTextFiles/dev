   may control some behaviours of that.

   - Shine
     The shadow pen to draw the bar.

   - Use always
     Always use the bar instead of pure space as spacer.


   @{u}Fonts@{uu}

   - Text
     The font to use for Text-only buttons.

   - TexGfx
     The font to use for Text-and-image buttons.


   @{u}Settings@{uu}

   - Precision
     The precision to use when obtaining pens.

   - Event
     The event to use for Mouse-over-button.

   - Scale factor
     The scale factor for Small (scaled) images.


   @{u}Group spacing@{uu}

   - Horiz
     The pixels among buttons in a horiz bar.

   - Vert
     The pixels among buttons in a vert bar.


   @{u}Inner spacing@{uu}

   - Horiz
     The pixels between the left/right frame and the contents of
     the button (text and/or image) for a BorderLess/RaisingFrame
     button.

   - Vert
     The pixels between the top/bottom frame and the contents of
     the button (text and/or image) for a BorderLess/RaisingFrame
     button.


   @{u}Text/Gfx spacing@{uu}

   - Horiz
     The pixels between the text and the image, if the text is
     placed at the left or at the right of the image.

   - Vert
     The pixels between the text and the image, if the text is
     placed at the top or at the bottom of the image.


   @{u}Note@{uu}

   Since SpeedBar V13, the text may be placed at the
   top/bottom/left/right of the image. The programmer decides to
   let the user modify the text position. If so, you should
   consider that choosing a very big font in Fonts/Text/Gfx
   maight result in the window being unabled to open.

   If you press the right-mouse-button a short popup menu will be
   shown; its items are:

   - alfie
     set my preferred values

   - defaults
     set default values
