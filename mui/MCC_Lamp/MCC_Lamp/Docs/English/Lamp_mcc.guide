    @{b}@{u}Lamp.mcc 11.1 - Copyright © 17-Mar-1997 by Maik "BLiZZeR" Schreiber@{uu} @{ub}

Lamp.mcc offers a little lamp which can be used for various purposes. It
enhances the programmer's abilities to give more informative feedback to the
user and thus just adds another level of communication in your programs!

You can set the color and the type of the lamp at any time.

Lamp.mcc has several special colors which can be configured using a MCP by
the user.

See the supplied demonstration program for more details.

The demonstration program compiles fine under MaxonC++ 4.0, SAS/C 6.57 and
StormC 1.1.
