Description
-----------

DateText is a Custom Class of the Magic User Interface © by Stefan Stuntz. It's a subclass of text-class and date-class.

The idea of this class was born during developing my Gregor application.

MUI public custom class displaying a text gadget for date strings. The display format of the date string can be freely defined.

DateText.mcc features that are of interest for users:
- Handles years from 8 to 8000
- Supports the Gregorian calendar reform
- Supports 21 languages
- Can be dragged around
- A week can begin with any weekday
- Supports various string formats

DateText.mcc features of interest for developers:
- Based on Date.mcc
- Supports MUIM_Import and MUIM_Export
- The date can be read as day/month/year format or as JD or MJD
- The date range can be restricted
- Method to set the current date
- Methods for increasing and decreasing the date
- Method to compare with another date object

The display format for a DateText object can be defined by the following formatting codes:

Syntax of Amiga compatible % commands:
  %d - Day number with leading 0s
  %e - Day number with leading spaces
  %m - Month number with leading 0s
  %h - Abbreviated month name
  %b - Abbreviated month name
  %B - Month name
  %y - Year using two digits with leading 0s
  %Y - Year using four digits with leading 0s
  %j - Julian date
  %w - Weekday number
  %a - Abbreviated weekday name
  %A - Weekday name
  %U - Week number, taking Sunday as first day of week
  %W - Week number, taking Monday as first day of week
  %x - Same as "%m/%d/%y"
  %D - Same as "%m/%d/%y"

Syntax of % commands:
  %Ddf  - Day with leading 0s
  %Ddv  - Day without leading 0s
  %DDf  - Day within the year with leading 0s
  %DDv  - Day within the year without leading 0s
  %Dmf  - Month with leading 0s
  %Dmv  - Month without leading 0s
  %Dms  - Month string
  %Dma  - Abbreviated month string
  %Dy2f - 2-digit year with leading 0s
  %Dy2v - 2-digit year without leading 0s
  %Dy4f - 4-digit year with leading 0s
  %Dy4v - 4-digit year without leading 0s
  %Dys  - Scaliger year
  %Dj   - JD date
  %DJ   - MJD date
  %Dwn  - Weekday number (1-7)
  %Dws  - Weekday string
  %Dwa  - Abbreviated weekday string
  %DWf  - Weeknumber with leading 0s
  %DWv  - Weeknumber without leading 0s
  %DMf  - Age of the moon (0-30 ?) with leading 0s
  %DMv  - Age of the moon (0-30 ?) without leading 0s

Installation
------------

Only use the installer script!
(The Installer must be in your system-path!)

If you use an Installer prior to V42 you should set the LANGUAGE Tooltype to your language. Installer V42 and better automatically use your current locale.


Please note that the installer-script is very special, because:

- It features uninstallation
- It is automated
- It is very flexible
- It is very intelligent (for an installer-script ;-)
- It uses @{"WrapGuide" link WrapGuide} (if present) for the @{AMIGAGUIDE}
  documentation if running under a pre V39 system.
- It can be reused by (hopefully) all other MUI custom classes, because the
  authors of custom classes need to only change a few things:

  * The #copyright variable
  * The #min_os_version and #min_os_revision variables
  * The #min_mui_version and #min_mui_revision variables
  * The #language_mcc and #language_mcc variables
  * The P_CustomExists, P_CustomInstall and P_CustomUninstall procedures
  * The 'APPNAME' tooltype within the MCC-Install icon.

Information for Developers
--------------------------

There is no multiple inheritance for Boopsi/MUI for the moment, so we haven't any chance to create a real Date basis-class. But there is another way to have the same result (compatibility for all classes that are dealing with dates).
The solution is called interface inheritance like it was done with IDL for CORBA.
DateText.mcc inherits the interface from Date.mcc!


Btw. it would be wise to use a

 SetAttrs(obj,
            MUIA_Date_Year,  year,
            MUIA_Date_Month, month,
            MUIA_Date_Day,   day,
          TAG_DONE
         );

instead of single set()'s.


- The following attributes are filtered out, so that they can't bring
  a DateText object into trouble:
  MUIA_Text_Contents, MUIA_Text_HiChar, MUIA_Text_SetVMax, MUIA_FillArea

- When MUIA_ObjectID is defined a DateText object will load/save the
  following data during MUIM_Application_Load/MUIM_Application_Save
  Day, Month, Year

- I heard that using 'test' and then 'cancel' the test settings within the
  MUI preference manager will not work as expected when in using your MUI
  classes within Libs:MUI/ instead of MUI:Libs/MUI/ !!!

- Old versions of the program called 'PhoneCost' written by André Schenk

  'date.library' into 'Libs:'.
