Description
-----------

TimeText is a Custom Class of the Magic User Interface © by Stefan Stuntz.
It's a subclass of text-class and time-class.

The idea of this class was born during developing my Gregor application.

MUI public custom class that displaying a text gadget for time strings. The
display format of the time string can be freely defined.

TimeText.mcc features that are of interest for users:
- Can be dragged around
- Handles daylight savings time
- Handles time zones
- Supports 12h and 24h clocks
- Supports various string formats

TimeText.mcc features of interest for developers:
- Based on Time.mcc
- Supports MUIM_Import and MUIM_Export
- The time can be read in hour/minutes/seconds format or as seconds from
  midnight on
- The time range can be restricted
- It's possible to notify a Date.mcc object when the next or previous day
  was reached
- Method to set the current time
- Methods for increasing and decreasing the time
- Method to compare with another time object

The display format for a TimeText object can be defined by the following
(locale.library compatible) formatting codes:

  %q - hour using 24-hour style
  %Q - hour using 12-hour style
  %H - hour using 24-hour style with leading 0s
  %I - hour using 12-hour style with leading 0s
  %p - AM or PM strings
  %M - the number of minutes with leading 0s
  %S - number of seconds with leadings 0s
  %r - same as "%I:%M:%S %p"
  %R - same as "%H:%M"
  %T - same as "%H:%M:%S"
  %X - same as "%H:%M:%S"

You can also use the following formatting codes:

  %Th1f  - hour using 12h style with leading 0s
  %Th1v  - hour using 12h style without leading 0s
  %Th2f  - hour using 24h style with leading 0s
  %Th2v  - hour using 24h style without leading 0s
  %Tpso  - a/p
  %Tpsu  - A/P
  %Tplo  - am/pm
  %Tplu  - AM/PM
  %Tmf   - minute with leading 0s
  %Tmv   - minute without leading 0s
  %Tsf   - second with leading 0s
  %Tsv   - second without leading 0s
  %Tj.   - jd time starting with '.'
  %Tj,   - jd time starting with ','
  %Tj0   - jd time starting with '0.'
  %Tj1   - jd time starting with '0,'

  %Tzh?? - hours only
  %Tzm?  - 0100 (always with leading 0s)
  %TzM?? - 01:00
  %Tz?z? - Use Z   for UTC/GMT
  %Tz?0? - Use +00 for UTC/GMT
  %Tz??f - use leading 0s
  %Tz??v - do not use leading 0s

  %Tc1   - Use DST for summer->winter change hour
  %Tc2   - Use I/II for summer->winter change hour
  %Tc3   - Use a/b for summer->winter change hour (24h only) - on 12h
           falls back to 2



Requirements
------------

- MUI 3.1 (Version 12)
- date.library
- locale.library

- To use the Greek MCC-Install script you need the
  "Greek Workbench" © AC Software

- To use the Russian MCC-Install script you need
  "Rusifier" © Dmitry Mikhilov



Installation
------------

Only use the installer script!
(The Installer must be in your system-path!)

If you use an Installer prior to V42 you should set the LANGUAGE Tooltype to
your language. Installer V42 and better automatically use your current locale.


Please note that the installer-script is very special, because:

- It features uninstallation
- It is automated
- It is very flexible
- It is very intelligent (for an installer-script ;-)
- It uses WrapGuide (if present) for the AmigaGuide®
  documentation if running under a pre V39 system.
- It can be reused by (hopefully) all other MUI custom classes, because the
  authors of custom classes need to only change a few things:

  * The #copyright variable
  * The #min_os_version and #min_os_revision variables
  * The #min_mui_version and #min_mui_revision variables
  * The #language_mcc and #language_mcc variables
  * The P_CustomExists, P_CustomInstall and P_CustomUninstall procedures
  * The 'APPNAME' tooltype within the MCC-Install icon.



Beta testers
------------

Version numbers of beta release will not change, so you must uninstall an
earlier installed beta version before you can install a newer one!



Information for Developers
--------------------------

There is no multiple inheritance for Boopsi/MUI for the moment, so we haven't
any chance to create a real Time basis-class. But there is another way to have
the same result (compatibility for all classes that are dealing with time).
The solution is called interface inheritance like it was done with IDL for
CORBA.
TimeText.mcc inherits the interface from Time.mcc!


Btw. it would be wise to use a

 SetAttrs(obj,
            MUIA_Time_Hour, hour,
            MUIA_Time_Min,  min,
            MUIA_Time_Sec,  sec,
          TAG_DONE
         );

instead of single set()'s.


- The following attributes are filtered out, so that they can't bring
  a TimeText object into trouble:
  MUIA_Text_Contents, MUIA_Text_HiChar, MUIA_Text_SetVMax, MUIA_FillArea

- When MUIA_ObjectID is defined a TimeText object will load/save the
  following data during MUIM_Application_Load/MUIM_Application_Save
  Hour, Min, Sec, Time Zone, DaylightSaving status

Known problems
--------------

- I heard that using 'test' and then 'cancel' the test settings within the
  MUI preference manager will not work as expected when in using your MUI
  classes within Libs:MUI/ instead of MUI:Libs/MUI/ !!!

- Old versions of the program called 'PhoneCost' written by André Schenk
  <schenkae@tick.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de> installed another
  'date.library' into 'Libs:'.
