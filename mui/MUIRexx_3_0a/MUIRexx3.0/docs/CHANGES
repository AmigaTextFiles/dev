changes from MUIRexx 2.2 to 3.0

- General bug fixes (see history).

- Added 'callhook' command.

    callhook ID/K,COMMAND/K,PORT/K,PRESS/S,APP/S,DROP/S,INCLUDE/K,EXCLUDE/K,
        ATTRS/K/M

    ID - an id of an existing object.

    COMMAND - command to be called when callback hook activated (see
        docs).

    PORT - port to send command to (see docs).

    PRESS - if this flag is given then the specified command (given
        in the COMMAND option) will will issued if the object is pressed
        (same as the default action given with the object's COMMAND option).

    APP - if this flag is given then the specified command (given
        in the COMMAND option) will will issued if an icon is dropped on the
        object from the Workbench.

    DROP - if this flag is given then the specified command (given
        in the COMMAND option) will will issued if another object is dropped
        on the object through a drag and drop operation.  Using the INCLUDE
        or EXCLUDE options drag and drop operations can be restricted to
        specific objects.

    INCLUDE - Limits drag and drop operations to a list of objects.  The
        list consists of object ids separated with commas.  The specified 
        objects do not have to actually exist (i.e. the listed objects can
        be created after the 'callhook' is defined).

    EXCLUDE - Limits drag and drop operations by excluding a list of objects.
        The list consists of object ids separated with commas.  The specified
        objects do not have to actually exist (i.e. the listed objects can
        be created after the 'callhook' is defined).

    ATTRS - A TAG pair consisting of a trigger attribute and value.  Used
        to create arbitrary callback hook triggers.  Do not use if PRESS,
        APP or DROP options are specified.

  Some examples,

    callhook ID DIR1 COMMAND """string ID STR1 CONTENT %s""" PORT DIRUTIL,
        ATTRS MUIA_List_Active MUIV_EveryTime

  which sets a callback hook that will be called everytime the DIR1 'dirlist'
  object becomes active (i.e. whenever a line is selected).  In this case,
  it will result in selected lines being displayed in the STR1 'string'
  object.

    callhook ID VLST DROP COMMAND """build:attrs VADD %s""" INCLUDE 'BLST'

  which will make the VLST object dropable with the command called everytime
  an object is dropped on VLST.  However, only lines from the BLST object will
  be accepted (specified using the INCLUDE option).

- Removed PRESS,APP,DROP options from all other commands (use 'callhook' instead).

- Removed COMMAND option from group command (use 'callhook' instead).

- Removed TRIG VAL options from object command (use 'callhook' instead).

- 'switch' objects can now have primary and alternate labels.  For example,

    switch LABELS "one,two"

  which will result in a 'switch' that displays "one" when unselected and "two"
  when selected.

- Added REMOVE option to 'list' object to allow removal of specific lines
  based on position or content.

- Empty groups (and windows) no longer cause crashes.  Why you would want
  to create empty groups or windows is questionable but at least it will no
  longer crash the machine.

- Groups can now be added dynamically to other groups.

- Added new 'group' POP option for creation of popup groups.  Also added
ICON and SPEC options to allow specification of popup button image.  For
example,

    group POP ICON "muirexx:demos/icons/apple" ATTRS MUIA_Group_Spacing 0
        .
        .
        .
    endgroup

- Added 'monitor' command to open/close console for display of received
command lines and error information.

- Added capability to specify inline commands (i.e. ARexx string macros)
for objects.

- Added SPEC option to button, text and switch objects.

- check and image object options changed (they are now specific instances
of the text object).
