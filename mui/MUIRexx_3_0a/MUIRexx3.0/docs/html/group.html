 -- Command: group ID/K, HELP/K, NODE/K, FRAME/S, HORIZ/S, REGISTER/S,

     This command begins the definition of a group. Groups are defined
     by placement of other groups and objects between a `group' and
     `endgroup' pair. The arguments are optional.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a group for later
          reference.  The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.  If the id is given without any other arguments,
          and the group has been previously created then the group will
          be placed into a temporary state where objects can be added
          or existing objects changed.  The `endgroup' command will
          terminate this temporary state and cause the affected window
          to be updated.  In this manner a window's contents may be
          dynamically altered.  In particular, object settings that can
          only be specified when they are initially created (those
          arguments indicated with a I) can be changed utilizing this
          feature.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer
          is over the associated group.  Of course, this is dependant
          on whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI preference
          settings.

        * NODE [I..] - this argument is used to specify a node in the
          guide file given in the command line argument HELP for
          `MUIRexx'.  If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          group and presses the help button on the keyboard then the
          guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * FRAME [I..] - if this switch is given then a frame will be
          rendered for the group.

        * HORIZ [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will be
          arranged horizontally. If not specified then the group will
          be arranged vertically.

        * REGISTER [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will
          be defined as a register group (i.e.  a group consisting of
          pages of objects or groups).  The LABELS argument must be
          given if this switch is specified.

        * VIRTUAL [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will be
          defined as a virtual group (i.e.  a group whose contents can
          be larger than the display region).  This option will result
          in a virtual group with no scroll bars.  The virtual group
          can be scrolled, however, by using the mouse (i.e. press and
          hold down the left mouse button while in the group and move
          past the edges or if you have a middle mouse button press and
          hold it while in the group and just move the mouse).

        * SCROLL [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will be
          defined as a virtual group (i.e.  a group whose contents can
          be larger than the display region).  This option will result
          in a virtual group with scroll bars.  The virtual group can
          be scrolled with the scroll bar gadgets or alternativily with
          the mouse as described above.

        * POP [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will be
          created as a popup group (i.e.  the group will be displayed
          if the associated popup object is pressed).  A pop button
          image may be specified using either the ICON or SPEC or LABEL
          options, otherwise, a default image (`MUII_PopUp') will be
          used.  Note that the contents of popup groups cannot be
          changed (by using the temporary change state as described
          above).

        * ICON [I..] - the name of an icon may be specified with this
          argument. If given then the popup image for a pop group (if
          POP was given) will be set to the icon image.  Note that the
          name of the icon should not be specified with a ".info".

        * SPEC [I..] - this argument is used to specify a MUI image
          specification (see <A HREF="muiimagespecifications.html">MUI Image Specifications</A>) for a pop group
          (if POP was given).

        * LABEL=LABELS [ISG] - either a group title, register labels,
          or popup label are specified with this option.  Multiple
          labels are separated by commas.  If the REGISTER switch was
          given then the labels correspond to the page titles.  For
          each label specified there must be a corresponding group or
          object defined.  If the REGISTER switch was not given then
          the first label will be rendered as a group title.  For
          register groups, if the group was previously created (and its
          window is open) then the current page may be set by issuing
          the group command, with an existing ID, and a label
          corresponding to the page to be activated.  Also, if an ID
          and the REGISTER switch are given without a label then the
          currently displayed page label will be returned in the `ARexx'
          variable RESULT (if `options results' was specified in the
          `ARexx' script).

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see <A HREF="attributetags.html">Attribute TAGs</A>).

     Some useful TAGs for use with the group command are:

          TAG_Name =                        TAG_id          Flags Type
          
          Group_ActivePage =                0x80424199 /* V5  isg LONG */
          Group_Columns =                   0x8042f416 /* V4  is. LONG */
          Group_Horiz =                     0x8042536b /* V4  i.. BOOL */
          Group_HorizSpacing =              0x8042c651 /* V4  isg LONG */
          Group_PageMode =                  0x80421a5f /* V5  i.. BOOL */
          Group_Rows =                      0x8042b68f /* V4  is. LONG */
          Group_SameHeight =                0x8042037e /* V4  i.. BOOL */
          Group_SameSize =                  0x80420860 /* V4  i.. BOOL */
          Group_SameWidth =                 0x8042b3ec /* V4  i.. BOOL */
          Group_Spacing =                   0x8042866d /* V4  is. LONG */
          Group_VertSpacing =               0x8042e1bf /* V4  isg LONG */
          
          Note: Consult MUI:Developer/Autodocs/MUI_Group.doc and
                MUI:Developer/C/Include/libraries/mui.h

     Example use of this command:

          window ID MDIR
              group ID REG REGISTER LABELS 'Directory,Buffers,Volumes,Mirror'
              .
              .
              .
          endwindow
          
          group ID REG REGISTER
          say result
