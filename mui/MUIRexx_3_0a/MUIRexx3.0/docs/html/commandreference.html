Command Reference
*****************

   This chapter is included as a reference to the commands available
for use in `ARexx' macros.

   Each command template is given in the standard DOS ReadArg form. 
That is each argument name is given separated by commas with flags
specified (separated by a /).  Within an `ARexx' script command
arguments should be separated by space (not commas).  The flag
definitions are as follows:

     Flag    Definition
     
     /K      Keyword required.
     /A      Argument required.
     /F      Final argument. The remainder of the line will be set to
             this argument.
     /M      Multiple arguments (separated by space).
     /S      Switch argument.

   Note that some string arguments shown in the examples are surrounded
by two sets of quotes (consisting of a pair of single quotes and a pair
of double quotes).  The general rule of thumb is if the argument is the
final argument (indicated by a /F in the command template) then only a
single pair of quotes is necessary.  Otherwise, if the string contains
spaces then the two sets of quotes are necessary.  The reason for this
is that `ARexx' tries to interpret every token it encounters.  If the
token is surrounded by quotes then the token is interpreted by removing
the quotes and leaving the enclosed string intact.  Likewise, the DOS
ReadArgs function (used by `MUI' to parse incoming `ARexx' command
lines) parses arguments separated by spaces, therefore, strings with
spaces must by enclosed by quotes (hence, the need for the two sets of
quotes).  An exception is if the argument is designated as the final
argument in which case the ReadArgs function will set the remainder of
the command line as the final argument.
