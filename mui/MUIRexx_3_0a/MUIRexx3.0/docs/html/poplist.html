 -- Command: poplist ID/K, COMMAND/K, PORT/K, HELP/K, NODE/K,
          ATTRS/K/M, CONTENT/K/F, SPEC/K, LABELS/K
     Poplist gadget objects are created with this command.  String and
     poplist gadgets are essentially identical with the only difference
     being the base object class to create each type of object.  The
     most notable difference is that the poplist object has an attached
     button that allows the user to bring up a list of strings
     (specified with the LABELS option).  All options are identical for
     these objects with the exception of the SPEC option (used to
     specify the popbutton image specification) and the LABELS option. 
     Refer to the <A HREF="string.html">string</A> command for descriptions of these options.

        * SPEC [I..] - this argument is used to specify a MUI image
          specification (see <A HREF="muiimagespecifications.html">MUI Image Specifications</A>) for the
          popbutton.  If not given then the image `MUII_PopUp' will be
          used.

        * LABELS [ISG] - a series of strings (separated by commas) may
          be specified by this argument.  These strings are used as the
          labels for the poplist object.
