Disclaimer
==========

   Basically, I am not in any way responsible if anything bad happens
to you because of using this software.  Say, for example, a mad MUI
hater breaks into your house and smashes up your computer because you
are using `MUIRexx' then I am not responsible ;-)

   Anyway, I hate disclaimers because the implication is that our
society has become so pitiful that we feel we have to protect ourselves
with legal disclaimers even though we, as freeware contributors, are
providing a service for no charge.  Therefore, I implore, if you are a
person who is inclined to use/abuse the legal system in anyway that
would cause harm to someone who is only trying to contribute to the
community then please do not use this software.
