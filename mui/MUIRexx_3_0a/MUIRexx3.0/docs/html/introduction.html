Introduction
************

   `MUIRexx' is a program which serves as an interface between `ARexx'
(Copyright (C) 1987, William S.  Hawes) and <A HREF="magicuserinterface.html">MagicUserInterface</A>
(Copyright (C) 1993-97, Stefan Stuntz). `MUIRexx' does not provide
complete access to all of the capabilities of MagicUserInterface (MUI),
however, quite a lot of capability is implemented in `MUIRexx' such as
notification, icon buttons, application objects (objects that react to
icons dropped on them), and drag/drop objects, as well as many standard
MUI objects.  Complete graphical user interfaces as well as full
applications can be developed using `MUIRexx' and `ARexx' macros. 
Additionally, it is also possible to dynamically change or add objects
after the application has been created.

   Since MUI is an object oriented extension it was felt that the
general flavor of object oriented programming (OOP) should be retained
in the `ARexx' implementation.  Therefore, the command structure has a
familiar OOP look to it which is somewhat of a departure from normal
`ARexx' programming construction.
