 -- Command: switch ID/K, COMMAND/K, PORT/K, HELP/K, NODE/K, ICON/K,
          SPEC/K, PICT/K, TRANS/S, ATTRS/K/M, LABEL=LABELS/K/F
     Switch gadget objects are created with this command.  Text,
     button, switch, check, and image gadgets are essentially identical
     with the only differences being the base object class and the
     default appearance/action. The switch gadget differs from text
     gadgets in that its select state toggles with each press. 
     Additionally, two labels may be given (using the LABEL option)
     seperated by a comma.  The first label will be displayed when the
     switch is unselected and the second when the switch is selected. 
     All options are identical for these objects.  Refer to the <A HREF="text.html">text</A>
     command for descriptions of the options.
