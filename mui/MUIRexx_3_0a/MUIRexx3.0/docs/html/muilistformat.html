MUI List Format
***************

   MUI has the ability to handle multi column lists.  To define how many
columns should be displayed and how they should be formatted, you
specify a format string.

   This format string must contain one entry for each column you want
to see. Entries are separated by commas with each line parsed via
dos.library/ReadArgs().

   The template for a single entry looks like this:

   DELTA=D/N, PREPARSE=P/K, WEIGHT=W/N, MINWIDTH=MIW/N, MAXWIDTH=MAW/N,
COL=C/N, BAR/S

   * DELTA - Space in pixel between this column and the next.  the last
     displayed column ignores this setting.  Defaults to 4.

   * PREPARSE - A preparse value for this column.  Setting this e.g.  to
     '\033c' would make the column centered (see <A HREF="muiformatsequences.html">MUI Format Sequences</A>).

   * WEIGHT - The weight of the column.  As with MUI's group class,
     columns are layouted with a minimum size, a maximum size and
     weight.  A column with a weight of 200 would gain twice the space
     than a column with a weight of 100.  Defaults to 100.

   * MINWIDTH - Minimum percentage width for the current column.  If
     your list is 200 pixel wide and you set this to 25, your column
     will at least be 50 pixel.  The special value -1 for this
     parameter means that the minimum width is as wide as the widest
     entry in this column.  This ensures that every entry will be
     completely visible (as long as the list is wide enough).  Defaults
     to -1.

   * MAXWIDTH - Maximum percentage width for the current column.  If
     your list is 200 pixel wide and you set this to 25, your column
     will not be wider as 50 pixel.  The special value -1 for this
     parameter means that the maximum width is as wide as the widest
     entry in this column.  Defaults to -1.

   * COL - This value adjusts the number of the current column.  This
     allows you to adjust the order of your columns.  Defaults to
     current entry number (0,1,...)

   * BAR - Since muimaster.library V11, you can enable a vertical bar
     between this and the next column by using this switch.

   If your list object gets so small there is not enough place for the
minwidth of a column, this column will be hidden completely and the
remaining space is distributed between the remaining columns.  This is
not true if the column is the first column, in this case the entries
will simply be clipped.

   Note:  You will have as many columns in your list as entries in the
format string (i.e.  number of commas + 1).  Empty entries, e.g.  with
a format string of ",,,," are perfectly ok.

   The default list format is an empty string (""), this means a one
column list without special formatting.

   For a dirlist object the column data, starting at column zero (0),
is the file name, size, date, time, protection, and comment.
