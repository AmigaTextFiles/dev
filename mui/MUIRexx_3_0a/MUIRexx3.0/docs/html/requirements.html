Requirements
============

   The minimum system requirements needed to use `MUIRexx' are as
follows.

   * An Amiga! (any should do)

   * Version 3.0 of the Amiga operating system or higher

   * MUI 3.0 or better (see <A HREF="magicuserinterface.html">MagicUserInterface</A>)

   * Icon.mcc custom class (included in the distribution)

   * ARexx (running of course)

Additionally, to run the included macros the following may be needed.

   * rexxsupport.library (needed by all the scripts)

   * some default icons and tools (take a look at the `deficon.rexx'
     script)

The following are nice-to-have but not absolutely necessary.

   * A graphics card for high resolution and lots of colors

   * NewIcons ((C) Nicola Salmoria/Philip A. Vedovatti/Eric Sauvageau)
     for 256 color icons (great for thumbnail previews of images)

   * PictIcon ((C) Chad Randall) to generate those 256 color icons
