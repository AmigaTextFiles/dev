Version 2.2
===========

   This release removes some bugs (see <A HREF="history.html">History</A>) and adds a TITLE option
for <A HREF="list.html">list</A> objects.  This much requested addition allows lists to have
titles (a string that remains at the top of the list).  Context
sensitive menus can now be created by simply defining a <A HREF="menu.html">menu</A> inside a
<A HREF="group.html">group</A> definition.  An option (SPEC) has been added to the <A HREF="popasl.html">popasl</A> and
<A HREF="poplist.html">poplist</A> objects to allow specification of the popbutton object.  Also,
a parse routine has been written to replace the builtin parse routine
in MUI.  This effectivily allows for arbitrary length command lines (up
to the limit imposed by `ARexx').

   Note that as of this release I am now making `MUIRexx' "supportware",
that is if you would like to show your support for further development
(and also enhance the prospect of getting support) then please consider
registering (see <A HREF="registration.html">Registration</A>).
