Version 3.0
===========

   This version of `MUIRexx' is a major update from the previous
version. I decided to designate this release a major update since some
significant changes have been made that will require changes to
existing scripts.  I again apologize for any inconvenience this causes.
 One of the biggest changes is the addition of the @{"callhook" Link "callhook"} command
that provides more flexibility in defining gadget actions.  A
consequence of this new command is the removal of the PRESS, APP, DROP
options from gadget commands which will necessitate changes in existing
scripts.  Also, most LABEL options are now final arguments and as a
consequence labels will no longer require double quoting.

   The major changes and additions include:

   * Added @{"callhook" Link "callhook"} command

   * Removed PRESS,APP,DROP options from all other commands

   * Removed COMMAND option from @{"group" Link "group"} command

   * Removed TRIG VAL options from @{"object" Link "object"} command

   * @{"switch" Link "switch"} objects can now have primary and alternate labels

   * Added REMOVE option to @{"list" Link "list"} object to allow removal of specific
     lines

   * Empty groups (and windows) no longer cause crashes

   * Groups can now be added dynamically to other groups

   * Added new @{"group" Link "group"} POP option for creation of popup groups

   * Added @{"monitor" Link "monitor"} command to open/close console for display of
     received command lines and error information

   * Added @{"print" Link "print"} command to output text to the console opened by the
     @{"monitor" Link "monitor"} command (useful for debugging purposes)

   * Added capability to specify inline commands (i.e. ARexx string
     macros) for objects (see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"})

   * Literal strings (strings created by prepending with an '=') are no
     longer returned with the prepended equals (see @{"list" Link "list"})

   * Added SPEC option to @{"button" Link "button"}, @{"text" Link "text"}, and @{"switch" Link "switch"} objects

   * @{"check" Link "check"} and @{"image" Link "image"} object options changed (they are now specific
     instances of the @{"text" Link "text"} object)

Version 2.2
===========

   This release removes some bugs (see @{"History" Link "History"}) and adds a TITLE option
for @{"list" Link "list"} objects.  This much requested addition allows lists to have
titles (a string that remains at the top of the list).  Context
sensitive menus can now be created by simply defining a @{"menu" Link "menu"} inside a
@{"group" Link "group"} definition.  An option (SPEC) has been added to the @{"popasl" Link "popasl"} and
@{"poplist" Link "poplist"} objects to allow specification of the popbutton object.  Also,
a parse routine has been written to replace the builtin parse routine
in MUI.  This effectivily allows for arbitrary length command lines (up
to the limit imposed by `ARexx').

   Note that as of this release I am now making `MUIRexx' "supportware",
that is if you would like to show your support for further development
(and also enhance the prospect of getting support) then please consider
registering (see @{"Registration" Link "Registration"}).

@Toc "Update Information"

Version 2.1
===========

   This release is a minor update to version 2.0 (see @{"Version 2.0" Link "Version 2.0"}).
Changes / additions include a more general `view' command (HELP, NODE
options as well as settable attributes), and new commands -
`aslrequest' that allows use of a standard ASL file requester within
scripts and `poplist' for creation of string gadgets with attached
popup lists.  Virtual groups are now supported (through the addition of
the `group' options SCROLL and VIRTUAL) The `image' object has been
changed and icon images (specified with the ICON option) now use an
external MUI class (which is included and must be installed).  Also,
the `list' command has been extended for better list handling.  General
improvements have been made including nonvolatile TAG string values
(strings passed as TAG values are stored in allocated memory), string
arrays for TAG values, and string formatting (`\\n' for carriage
returns and `\\xxx' for octal specification of characters).

   Additionally, the previous documentation neglected to mention a
feature of the `list' object supporting multicolumn lists.  Strings
inserted into lists may consist of several strings separated with
commas.  If the `list' is given a format (with the LIST_FORMAT
attribute TAG) then these strings will be displayed in the appropriate
column (as defined by the format).

Version 2.0
===========

   This version of `MUIRexx' is a major update from the previous
version. I decided to designate this release a major update since a lot
has changed (see @{"History" Link "History"}) and most likely any scripts written for
previous versions will break under this version.  I apologize for any
inconvenience this causes, but it was necessary to make major changes
to implement some new capabilities.  One of the biggest changes is that
most options now require a keyword, so if you find that gadgets are
missing (or even whole groups) then it is probably because a keyword is
missing (like the LABEL keyword for example).  Please have a look at
the included example scripts to get an idea of how things should now
look.  Also, AmigaDOS 3.0 or better is now required because of the need
for datatypes.library.

   Some other major changes and additions include:

   * Multiple labels specified in a comma delimited list (used to be
     specified as multiple arguments separated by space)

   * Attribute TAGS can be set and retrieved, greatly improving
     flexibility and eliminating the need for some options (which have
     been removed, e.g. WEIGHT)

   * New `object' command for creation of generalized objects based on
     MUI internal and external classes as well as BOOPSI classes (also
     eliminated the need for some built-in objects, like `scale')

   * New `method' command to allow creation of class methods which
     greatly enhances flexibility and eliminates need for some commands
     (which have been removed, e.g. `muiset', `config')

   * Drag and drop operations are fully support for some objects

   * Internal variables may be set or retrieved for passing data
     conveniently between `ARexx' scripts

   Note that if a script does fail then most likely the application
will still be running (even if no window is open).  In this case just
issue the @{"quit" Link "quit"} command to the application port.

Introduction
************

   `MUIRexx' is a program which serves as an interface between `ARexx'
(Copyright (C) 1987, William S.  Hawes) and @{"MagicUserInterface" Link "MagicUserInterface"}
(Copyright (C) 1993-97, Stefan Stuntz). `MUIRexx' does not provide
complete access to all of the capabilities of MagicUserInterface (MUI),
however, quite a lot of capability is implemented in `MUIRexx' such as
notification, icon buttons, application objects (objects that react to
icons dropped on them), and drag/drop objects, as well as many standard
MUI objects.  Complete graphical user interfaces as well as full
applications can be developed using `MUIRexx' and `ARexx' macros. 
Additionally, it is also possible to dynamically change or add objects
after the application has been created.

   Since MUI is an object oriented extension it was felt that the
general flavor of object oriented programming (OOP) should be retained
in the `ARexx' implementation.  Therefore, the command structure has a
familiar OOP look to it which is somewhat of a departure from normal
`ARexx' programming construction.

Installation
************

   Just use the supplied install script.  It will ask for a directory
to install the demos and documentation.  It will also prompt for the
directory to place the `MUIRexx' executable.  Make sure the selected
directory is in your global search path.

   Also, the external MUI class, Icon.mcc, must be copied to
MUI:Libs/MUI.  I recommend using the supplied install script which will
install the class and all supporting files.

   `MUIRexx' may be started either from a CLI or from the WorkBench.
The command line syntax for `MUIRexx' is:

     -> [run] MUIRexx (script) PORT (portname) HELP (guidename)
                               OUTPUT (outname) ERROUT (outname)

If (SCRIPT) is specified then the corresponding `ARexx' script will be
executed, otherwise, the code will wait until it receives a command,
presumably from a subsequently executed `ARexx' command or script.  The
PORT option will set the `MUIRexx' host address to (PORTNAME).  If not
given then the host address will be MUIREXX.  The HELP option specifies
an AmigaGuide® file to be used for online help (see the NODE argument
descriptions for selected gadgets). The OUTPUT and ERROUT options will
turn on port monitoring which will result in a trace list of either all
issued commands or just errors (and the commands associated with the
errors) respectivily. The (OUTNAME) may be a file name or console
device.  If none is specified then the default is CON:.

   To use `MUIRexx' from the WorkBench a project icon must be supplied
with the application startup script.  The icon name should be the
startup script name with the file extension .INFO replacing .REXX.
Alternativily, a tooltype SCRIPT may be set to the name of the script
to be executed on startup.  The full path should be specified if the
icon is not located in the same directory as the script.  The default
tool for the icon should be set to `MUIRexx' (with the full path
included if `MUIRexx' is not in the global path).  A tooltype PORT may
be specified to set the host address name for the application.  If this
tooltype is not specified then the name will be set to the icon name
(minus the .INFO extension).  Also, a tooltype HELP may be included to
specify the AmigaGuide® file as above.  It is also recommended that the
value for the stack size be set at a reasonable level (whatever that
is). If problems occur running a script try setting the stack higher.
Likewise, tooltypes can be defined for OUTPUT and ERROUT.

Command Reference
*****************

   This chapter is included as a reference to the commands available
for use in `ARexx' macros.

   Each command template is given in the standard DOS ReadArg form. 
That is each argument name is given separated by commas with flags
specified (separated by a /).  Within an `ARexx' script command
arguments should be separated by space (not commas).  The flag
definitions are as follows:

     Flag    Definition
     
     /K      Keyword required.
     /A      Argument required.
     /F      Final argument. The remainder of the line will be set to
             this argument.
     /M      Multiple arguments (separated by space).
     /S      Switch argument.

   Note that some string arguments shown in the examples are surrounded
by two sets of quotes (consisting of a pair of single quotes and a pair
of double quotes).  The general rule of thumb is if the argument is the
final argument (indicated by a /F in the command template) then only a
single pair of quotes is necessary.  Otherwise, if the string contains
spaces then the two sets of quotes are necessary.  The reason for this
is that `ARexx' tries to interpret every token it encounters.  If the
token is surrounded by quotes then the token is interpreted by removing
the quotes and leaving the enclosed string intact.  Likewise, the DOS
ReadArgs function (used by `MUI' to parse incoming `ARexx' command
lines) parses arguments separated by spaces, therefore, strings with
spaces must by enclosed by quotes (hence, the need for the two sets of
quotes).  An exception is if the argument is designated as the final
argument in which case the ReadArgs function will set the remainder of
the command line as the final argument.

 -- Command: window ID/K, COMMAND/K, PORT/K, TITLE/K, CLOSE/S, ATTRS/K/M
     This command begins the definition of a window. All group and
     initial object definitions must be placed between a `window' and
     `endwindow' pair.  The arguments are optional.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a window for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.

        * COMMAND [I..] - if given, a close gadget will be attached to
          the window.  If the null string is specified then the window
          will simply be disposed when the close gadget is selected,
          otherwise, the command string given will be executed.  For a
          complete description of this option see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.
           Note that the window title will be used to replace a `%s'
          contained in the command string.  Also, note that it is up to
          the programmer to insure that the window is in fact closed,
          presumably by the macro that is specified in this argument.

        * PORT [I..] - a specific host port may be specified by this
          argument. For a complete description of this option see
          @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.

        * TITLE [I..] - the window may be given a title which will be
          displayed in the windows title bar.

        * CLOSE [.S.] - if this switch is given and an id specified (see
          ID argument) for an existing window then the window will be
          closed.

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with the window command are:

          TAG_Name =                        TAG_id          Flags Type

          Window_AltHeight =                0x8042cce3 /* V4  i.g LONG */
          Window_AltLeftEdge =              0x80422d65 /* V4  i.g LONG */

Groups
======

   The following commands are used for group creation.  Some arguments
can be used after the groups window is opened to change or retrieve
settings.  In the argument descriptions the keywords are followed by a
pair of [] containing indicator letters.  If the letter I is indicated
then the argument is valid during creation.  If the letter S is
indicated then the argument can be set after the groups window is open.
 If the letter G is indicated then the argument can be retrieved.


 @{" group " Link "group"} 
 @{" endgroup " Link "endgroup"} 


@EndNode

@Node "group" "MUIRexx.guide/group"
@Next "endgroup"
@Prev "Groups"
@Toc "Groups"

 -- Command: group ID/K, HELP/K, NODE/K, FRAME/S, HORIZ/S, REGISTER/S,
          VIRTUAL/S, SCROLL/S, POP/S, ICON/K, SPEC/K, ATTRS/K/M,
          LABEL=LABELS/K/F
     This command begins the definition of a group. Groups are defined
     by placement of other groups and objects between a `group' and
     `endgroup' pair. The arguments are optional.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a group for later
          reference.  The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.  If the id is given without any other arguments,
          and the group has been previously created then the group will
          be placed into a temporary state where objects can be added
          or existing objects changed.  The `endgroup' command will
          terminate this temporary state and cause the affected window
          to be updated.  In this manner a window's contents may be
          dynamically altered.  In particular, object settings that can
          only be specified when they are initially created (those
          arguments indicated with a I) can be changed utilizing this
          feature.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer
          is over the associated group.  Of course, this is dependant
          on whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI preference
          settings.

        * NODE [I..] - this argument is used to specify a node in the
          guide file given in the command line argument HELP for
          `MUIRexx'.  If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          group and presses the help button on the keyboard then the
          guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * FRAME [I..] - if this switch is given then a frame will be
          rendered for the group.

        * HORIZ [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will be
          arranged horizontally. If not specified then the group will
          be arranged vertically.

        * REGISTER [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will
          be defined as a register group (i.e.  a group consisting of
          pages of objects or groups).  The LABELS argument must be
          given if this switch is specified.

        * VIRTUAL [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will be
          defined as a virtual group (i.e.  a group whose contents can
          be larger than the display region).  This option will result
          in a virtual group with no scroll bars.  The virtual group
          can be scrolled, however, by using the mouse (i.e. press and
          hold down the left mouse button while in the group and move
          past the edges or if you have a middle mouse button press and
          hold it while in the group and just move the mouse).

        * SCROLL [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will be
          defined as a virtual group (i.e.  a group whose contents can
          be larger than the display region).  This option will result
          in a virtual group with scroll bars.  The virtual group can
          be scrolled with the scroll bar gadgets or alternativily with
          the mouse as described above.

        * POP [I..] - if this switch is given then the group will be
          created as a popup group (i.e.  the group will be displayed
          if the associated popup object is pressed).  A pop button
          image may be specified using either the ICON or SPEC or LABEL
          options, otherwise, a default image (`MUII_PopUp') will be
          used.  Note that the contents of popup groups cannot be
          changed (by using the temporary change state as described
          above).

        * ICON [I..] - the name of an icon may be specified with this
          argument. If given then the popup image for a pop group (if
          POP was given) will be set to the icon image.  Note that the
          name of the icon should not be specified with a ".info".

        * SPEC [I..] - this argument is used to specify a MUI image
          specification (see @{"MUI Image Specifications" Link "MUI Image Specifications"}) for a pop group
          (if POP was given).

        * LABEL=LABELS [ISG] - either a group title, register labels,
          or popup label are specified with this option.  Multiple
          labels are separated by commas.  If the REGISTER switch was
          given then the labels correspond to the page titles.  For
          each label specified there must be a corresponding group or
          object defined.  If the REGISTER switch was not given then
          the first label will be rendered as a group title.  For
          register groups, if the group was previously created (and its
          window is open) then the current page may be set by issuing
          the group command, with an existing ID, and a label
          corresponding to the page to be activated.  Also, if an ID
          and the REGISTER switch are given without a label then the
          currently displayed page label will be returned in the `ARexx'
          variable RESULT (if `options results' was specified in the
          `ARexx' script).

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with the group command are:

          TAG_Name =                        TAG_id          Flags Type

 -- Command: menu ID/K, ATTRS/K/M, LABEL/K/F
     This command begins the definition of a menu. Menus are defined by
     placement of other menus and menu items between a `menu' and
     `endmenu' pair.  If a menu is defined within a window definition
     (i.e. between a WINDOW and ENDWINDOW pair), but outside any group
     definitions then the menu will be added to the window menu strip. 
     If a menu is defined within a group then a context sensitive menu
     will be created for the group (i.e. when the mouse pointer is over
     the group and the right mouse button is pressed then a popup menu
     will be displayed). Note that only one menu may be defined for a
     context sensitive menu (all others will be ignored).

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a menu for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.

        * LABEL [I..] - the menu must be given a label which will be
          displayed in the menu bar of the window.

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with the menu command are:

          TAG_Name =                        TAG_id          Flags Type

     This command defines a menu item.  This command is only valid
     between a `menu' and `endmenu' pair.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a menu item for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.

        * COMMAND [I..] - if given, the command will be executed
          whenever the menu item is selected.  For a complete
          description of this option see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.  Note
          that the menu item label (see the LABEL argument description)
          will be used to replace a `%s' contained in the command
          string.

        * PORT [I..] - a specific host port may be specified by this
          argument. For a complete description of this option see
          @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.

        * LABEL [I..] - this is the text for the menu item (which must

Objects
=======

   The following commands are used to create and manipulate objects.
Some arguments can be used after the object's window is opened to
change or retrieve settings.  Also, issuing an object command with only
an ID argument will return a result in the `ARexx' variable RESULT (if
`options results' was specified in the `ARexx' script).  In the
argument descriptions the keywords are followed by a pair of []
containing indicator letters.  If the letter I is indicated then the
argument is valid during creation.  If the letter S is indicated then
the argument can be set after the objects window is open.  If the letter
G is indicated then the argument can be retrieved.

 -- Command: space BAR/S, HORIZ/S, VALUE
     This object will place some white space into the current location.
     A consequence of placing space is that the window will be sizable
     in the associated direction. The arguments are optional.

        * BAR [I..] - if this switch is given then a bar will be
          rendered in the center of the space.

        * HORIZ [I..] - if this switch is given then the space will be a
          horizontal space (best used within a horizontal group)
          otherwise the space will be vertical.

        * VALUE [I..] - this argument, if given, specifies the minimum
          amount of space.  The default value is zero.

     Example use of this command:

          window

     This object is a simple label that can be used in conjunction with
     another object for clarification of the other objects purpose.

        * LEFT [I..] - this switch will force the label to be left
          justified.

        * CENTER [I..] - this switch will force the label to be
          centered.

        * SINGLE [I..] - this switch will cause extra vertical space to
          be added to the label to center it about the same space
          occupied by an object with a single width frame.

        * DOUBLE [I..] - this switch will cause extra vertical space to
          be added to the label to center it about the same space
          occupied by an object with a double width frame.

        * LABEL [I..] - this is the text for the label (which must be
          the last argument and may contain spaces).

 -- Command: view ID/K, HELP/K, NODE/K, FILE/K, ATTRS/K/M, STRING/K/F
     This specifies a view object.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a view for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer
          is over the associated view object.  Of course, this is
          dependant on whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI
          preference settings.

        * NODE [I..] - this argument is used to specify a node in the
          guide file given in the command line argument HELP for
          `MUIRexx'.  If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          view object and presses the help button on the keyboard then
          the guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * FILE [I..] - If this argument is given then the view contents
          will be retrieved from the specified file.

        * STRING [I..] - this is the view content string.  Note that
          the string may contain any of the special formatting
          sequences (see @{"MUI Format Sequences" Link "MUI Format Sequences"}).  Also, if this argument
          is given then it must be the last specified.

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with the gauge command are:

          TAG_Name =                        TAG_id          Flags Type

 -- Command: text ID/K, COMMAND/K, PORT/K, HELP/K, NODE/K, ICON/K,
          SPEC/K, PICT/K, TRANS/S, ATTRS/K/M, LABEL/K/F
     Text gadget objects are created with this command.  Text, button,
     switch, check, and image gadgets are essentially identical with
     the only differences being the base object class and the default
     appearance/action. All options are identical for these objects.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a gadget for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.  If the id is given without any other arguments,
          and the object has been previously created, then the label
          will be returned in RESULT (if OPTIONS RESULTS is specified
          in the script).

        * COMMAND [I..] - if given, the command will be executed
          whenever the gadget is pressed.  For a complete description
          of this option see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.  Note that the
          gadget label (see the LABEL argument description) will be
          used to replace a `%s' contained in the command string. 
          Additionally, if the gadget is an icon (specified by the ICON
          argument) and a command is not specified but a port is (see
          PORT argument description) then the command will be set to
          the default tool of the icon.  For example, if the icons
          default tool is `MultiView' then the command string will be
          set to `MultiView %s'.

        * PORT [I..] - a specific host port may be specified by this
          argument. For a complete description of this option see
          @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer
          is over the associated gadget.  Of course, this is dependant
          on whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI preference
          settings.

        * NODE [I..] - this argument is used to specify a node in the
          guide file given in the command line argument HELP for
          `MUIRexx'.  If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          gadget and presses the help button on the keyboard then the
          guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * ICON [I..] - the name of an icon may be specified with this
          argument. If given then the gadget image will be set to the
          icon image.  Note that the name of the icon should not be
          specified with a ".info".

        * SPEC [I..] - this argument is used to specify a MUI image
          specification (see @{"MUI Image Specifications" Link "MUI Image Specifications"}).  For `check'
          objects if not given then the image `MUII_CheckMark' will be
          used.

        * PICT [I..] - the name of a picture may be specified with this
          argument.  If given then the gadget image will be set to the
          picture content.  Any picture with an associated installed
          datatype may be used.

        * TRANS [I..] - if this flag is given then the background color
          of the picture (defined with the PICT option) will be
          transparent.

        * LABEL=LABELS [ISG] - the label for the gadget is given by this
          argument.  Note that the string may contain any of the
          special formatting sequences (see @{"MUI Format Sequences" Link "MUI Format Sequences"}). 
          Additionally, even though the label is not displayed for
          image gadgets it may still be used in the command string (see
          COMMAND argument above).  Also, for `switch' and `check'
          objects two strings may be given (separated by a comma) that
          will be returned depending on the select state of the gadget.
           The first defines the unselected string and the second
          defines the selected. If not specified then the unselected
          string will be set to 0 and the selected string will be set
          to 1.

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with this command are:

     Cycle gadget objects are created with this command.  Cycle and
     radio gadgets are essentially identical with the only difference
     being the base object class to create each type of object.  All
     options are identical for these objects.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a gadget for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.  If the id is given without any other arguments,
          and the gadget has been previously created, then the
          currently selected label will be returned in RESULT (if
          OPTIONS RESULTS is specified in the script).

        * COMMAND [I..] - if given, the command will be executed
          whenever the gadget is selected.  For a complete description
          of this option see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.  Note that the
          gadget active label (see the LABELS argument description)
          will be used to replace a `%s' contained in the command
          string.

        * PORT [I..] - a specific host port may be specified by this
          argument. For a complete description of this option see
          @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer
          is over the associated gadget.  Of course, this is dependant
          on whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI preference
          settings.

        * NODE [I..] - this argument is used to specify a node in the
          guide file given in the command line argument HELP for
          `MUIRexx'.  If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          gadget and presses the help button on the keyboard then the
          guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * LABELS [ISG] - a series of strings (separated by commas) may
          be specified by this argument.  These strings are used as the
          labels for the gadget object.  The currently displayed label
          may be retrieved by issuing the gadget command with an
          existing ID.  Also, the selected label may be set by issuing
          the gadget command with an existing ID and label.  Note that
          the labels may contain any of the special formatting
          sequences (see @{"MUI Format Sequences" Link "MUI Format Sequences"}).

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with this command are:

     List objects are created with this command.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a list for later
          reference.  The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.  If the id is given without any other arguments,
          and the list object has been previously created, then the
          currently selected line will be returned in RESULT (if
          OPTIONS RESULTS is specified in the script).  If multiple
          lines are selected then each line will be returned with each
          list command.  The line entry in the list will be deselected.
           A null string ("") will be returned if no lines are selected
          (or the last selected line has been reached).

        * COMMAND [I..] - if given, the command will be executed
          whenever a line in the list is double clicked.  For a
          complete description of this option see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.
           Note that the selected line will be used to replace a `%s'
          contained in the command string.

        * PORT [I..] - a specific host port may be specified by this
          argument. For a complete description of this option see
          @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer
          is over the associated list. Of course, this is dependant on
          whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI preference
          settings.

        * NODE [I..] - this argument is used to specify a node in the
          guide file given in the command line argument HELP for
          `MUIRexx'.  If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          list and presses the help button on the keyboard then the
          guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * TITLE [IS.] - this argument is used to specify a title for
          the list. A title will be shown at the top of the list and
          will remain even if the list scrolled.  Note that the format
          of the title will be the same as for the string entries (see
          the STRING option description below).

        * POS [.SG] - if this argument is given and a string is
          specified (with the STRING argument) then the string will be
          inserted at this position.  Special values (see List.mui
          Autodoc entry for MUIA_List_Insert) may be used.  If no
          string is given then the string located at the given position
          will be returned in the `ARexx' variable RESULT.  If a null
          string is given (by specifying the STRING option with no
          string or "") then the string at this position will be
          removed.

        * INSERT [.S.] - if this switch is given then any string
          supplied by the STRING argument will be inserted into the
          current list.  If no position is specified (with the POS
          argument) then the string will be inserted at the current
          DropMark (see List.mui Autodoc entry for MUIA_List_DropMark).

        * REMOVE [.S.] - if this switch is given then an entry will be
          removed from the list.  If no position or label is specified
          (with the POS argument) then the currently selected entry
          will be removed.  If a label is given (using the LABEL
          option) then the entry matching that label will be removed.

        * NODUP [IS.] - if this switch is given then no duplicate
          strings will be displayed.

        * TOGGLE [.S.] - if this switch is given then the select state
          of each displayed string will be toggled.

        * STRING [ISG] - a string to be entered into the list may be
          specified by this argument.  Note that the string may contain
          any of the special formatting sequences (see
          @{"MUI Format Sequences" Link "MUI Format Sequences"}).  Additionally, multicolumn lists may
          be created.  A string may, in fact, consist of several
          strings separated with commas.  If the list is given a format
          (with the LIST_FORMAT attribute TAG) then these strings will
          be displayed in the appropriate column (as defined by the
          format, see @{"MUI List Format" Link "MUI List Format"}).  Prepending any substring with
          an equals symbol (=) will force the rest of the string to be
          interpreted literally thereby allowing commas within a
          string.  Note that the equals symbol will be removed from any
          retreived literal string.

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with this command are:

          TAG_Name =                        TAG_id          Flags Type

 -- Command: dirlist ID/K, COMMAND/K, PORT/K, HELP/K, NODE/K, PATH/K,
          PATTERN/K, REREAD/S ,TOGGLE/S, ATTRS/K/M
     Dirlist objects are created with this command.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a dirlist for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.  If the id is given without any other arguments,
          and the dirlist has been previously created, then the
          currently selected file (with path) will be returned in
          RESULT (if OPTIONS RESULTS is specified in the script).  If
          multiple files are selected then each file name (with path)
          will be returned with each dirlist command.  The file name
          entry in the list will be deselected.  A null string ("")
          will be returned if no files are selected (or the last
          selected file has been reached).

        * COMMAND [I..] - if given, the command will be executed
          whenever an item in the dirlist is double clicked.  For a
          complete description of this option see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.
           Note that the full path of the selected item will be used to
          replace a `%s' contained in the command string.

        * PORT [I..] - a specific host port may be specified by this
          argument. For a complete description of this option see
          @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer

          on whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI preference
          settings.

          `MUIRexx'. If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          dirlist and presses the help button on the keyboard then the
          guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * PATH [ISG] - at creation this argument specifies the initial
          directory path. When the dirlist command is issued with just
          the ID argument a fully qualified path name is returned for
          the file or directory selected in the listview.

        * PATTERN [IS.] - this argument sets the accept pattern for the
          directory list.  Any standard AmigaDOS pattern may be given. 
          Note that if a path is set (see PATH argument) or the
          directory is reread (see REREAD argument) then this pattern
          will be reflected.

        * REREAD [.S.] - if this switch is given then the dirlist will
          be updated with the current directory.

        * TOGGLE [.S.] - if this switch is given then the select state
          of each displayed file will be toggled.

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

 -- Command: volumelist ID/K, COMMAND/K, PORT/K, HELP/K, NODE/K,
          ATTRS/K/M
     volumelist objects are created with this command.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a volumelist for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.  If the id is given without any other arguments,
          and the volumelist has been previously created, then the
          currently selected volume will be returned in RESULT (if
          OPTIONS RESULTS is specified in the script).

        * COMMAND [I..] - if given, the command will be executed
          whenever an item in the volumelist is double clicked.  For a
          complete description of this option see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.
           Note that the selected volume name will be used to replace a
          `%s' contained in the command string.

        * PORT [I..] - a specific host port may be specified by this
          argument. For a complete description of this option see
          @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer
          is over the associated volumelist. Of course, this is
          dependant on whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI
          preference settings.

        * NODE [I..] - this argument is used to specify a node in the
          guide file given in the command line argument HELP for
          `MUIRexx'.  If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          volumelist and presses the help button on the keyboard then
          the guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with this command are:

          TAG_Name =                        TAG_id          Flags Type

 -- Command: object ID/K, HELP/K, NODE/K, CLASS/K, BOOPSI/S, ATTRS/K/M
     Objects from MUI internal, external and BOOPSI classes are created
     with this command.  Note that while this is a very powerful and
     flexible command it can easily result in the unexpected, including
     system crashes, so beware.

        * ID [I..] - an id can be assigned to a object for later
          reference. The id can be any combination of up to 5
          characters.

        * HELP [I..] - with this argument help text may be defined
          which will be displayed as balloon help whenever the pointer
          is over the associated object. Of course, this is dependant
          on whether the user set up balloon help in the MUI preference
          settings.

        * NODE [I..] - this argument is used to specify a node in the
          guide file given in the command line argument HELP for
          `MUIRexx'.  If the user positions the mouse pointer over the
          object and presses the help button on the keyboard then the
          guide file will be displayed at the node location.

        * CLASS [I..] - this argument allows specification of the
          object class. The class may be any internal or external MUI
          or BOOPSI (see the BOOPSI option) gadget class.

        * BOOPSI [I..] - if this switch is given then the object will be
          created from a BOOPSI gadget class.  BOOPSI objects will, by
          default, have the following TAG ids and values set:

               TAG             value
               
               GA_Left         0
               GA_Top          0
               GA_Width        0
               GA_Height       0
               ICA_TARGET      ICTARGET_IDCMP

        * ATTRS [ISG] - with this option any MUIA attribute TAGs may be
          set or retrieved (see @{"Attribute TAGs" Link "Attribute TAGs"}).

     Some useful TAGs for use with this command are:

     This command will bring up a standard `MUI' requester.  Note that
     this command is syncronous.  That is once it is issued it will not
     return a result until the user has selected a gadget.  Once a
     gadget has been selected then a number will be returned in the
     `ARexx' variable RESULT (assuming `options results' was specified
     in the script). The first gadget will return a 1, the second a 2,
     and so on.  The last gadget, however, will return a 0 (this is by
     convention since the last gadget is typically a CANCEL or
     equivilent gadget).

        * ID - this argument specifies a window ID.  If specified then
          the requester will be centered in the window.

        * TITLE - this argument specifies the requester title (placed
          in the title bar of the requester window).

        * GADGETS - this argument specifies the gadget labels.  The
          labels are given as a single string with a vertical bar, |
          used to separate each label.  Additionally, each label can
          contain an underscore, _ prior to any character.  The
          character will be the keyboard shortcut to activate the
          associated gadget.

        * FILE - if given, this argument specifies the file to get the
          contents for the requester.  All line breaks in the file will
          be included.  Note that this argument overrides the STRING
          argument.

        * STRING - this argument specifies the string to display in the
          requester.

     Example use of this command:

          request ID MDIR GADGETS '"OK|Cancel"' '"Delete selected entries?"'

 -- Command: aslrequest ID/K, TITLE/K, ATTRS/K/M
     This command will bring up a standard ASL file requester.  Note
     that this command is syncronous.  That is once it is issued it
     will not return a result until the user has selected a
     file/directory or canceled.  Once a file/directory has been

 -- Command: callhook ID/K, COMMAND/K, PORT/K, PRESS/S, APP/S, DROP/S,
          INCLUDE/K, EXCLUDE/K, TRIG=ATTRS/K/M
     This command is used to define callback notification methods for
     objects. Trigger actions can be defined for object selection, drop
     and app operations, as well as object specific actions.

        * ID - an id of an existing gadget.

        * COMMAND - if given, the command will be executed whenever the
          gadget is pressed (PRESS switch specified or default for no
          switch), an icon is dropped (APP switch), or another object
          is dropped (DROP switch) on the gadget.  For a complete
          description of this option see @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.  Note
          that the object label (for PRESS actions), or an icon name
          (for APP actions), or a dropped object label (for DROP
          actions) will be used to replace a `%s' contained in the
          command string, as appropriate.

        * PORT [I..] - a specific host port may be specified by this
          argument. For a complete description of this option see
          @{"Command-Port Options" Link "Command-Port Options"}.

        * PRESS - if this flag is given then the specified command
          (given in the COMMAND option) will will issued if the object
          is pressed. (same as the default action given with the
          object's COMMAND option).

        * APP - if this flag is given then the specified command (given
          in the COMMAND option) will will issued if an icon is dropped
          on the object from the Workbench.

        * DROP - if this flag is given then the specified command (given
          in the COMMAND option) will will issued if another object is
          dropped on the object through a drag and drop operation. 
          Using the INCLUDE or EXCLUDE options drag and drop operations
          can be restricted to specific objects.

        * INCLUDE - Limits drag and drop operations to a list of
          objects.  The list consists of object ids separated with
          commas.  The specified objects do not have to actually exist
          (i.e. the listed objects can be created after the 'callhook'
          is defined).

        * EXCLUDE - Limits drag and drop operations by excluding a list
          of objects.  The list consists of object ids separated with
          commas.  The specified objects do not have to actually exist
          (i.e.  the listed objects can be created after the 'callhook'
          is defined).

        * TRIG - A TAG pair consisting of a trigger attribute and
          value.  Used to create arbitrary callback hook triggers.  Do
          not use if PRESS, APP or DROP options are specified.

     Example use of this command:

          /* the following defines a command that will be triggered everytime
             a list entry becomes active */
          callhook ID DIR1 COMMAND """string ID STR1 CONTENT %s""" PORT DIRUTIL,

     complicated and possibly dangerous (can result in system crashes).
      Care should be taken by consulting the autodocs describing the
     method to be constructed.  RESULT will contain the value returned
     by the domethod function.

          for the method.  If it is not given then the application
          object will be used.

        * ARGS - these arguments are the remaining arguments passed to

MUIRexxDock
===========

   This `MUIRexx' application is used to build and maintain utility
docks.  There is currently no documentation available, but hopefully
operation is intuitive enough to figure out.  Try opening the edit
window (using the dock's menu) and drag and drop either a dock icon or
an icon from the Workbench onto the edit window icon area (above the
cycle gadget). After editting the dock item either drag the icon back
to the dock (replacing the icon it is dropped on) or press the [add]
button to add the icon to the end of the dock.  Also while the edit
window is open dock items in the dock can be rearranged by dragging one
icon onto another.  Dock items can be buttons (typically used to start
programs), switches (typically used as a toggle), docks (other subdocks
of items), or pop groups.  Pop groups may consist of any set of objects
and are created in the edit window by entering `MUIRexx' commands into
the list located on the 'Pop' register page.  Simple buttons may be
easily created by dropping command icons from the Workbench onto the
'Pop' list.  To edit or delete command lines in the 'Pop' list simply
double click on the line and edit the string or press the [del] button
to delete.  Entering a string will add the command line to the end of
the 'Pop' list.  Lines in this list are drag sortable.  Also,
additional commands may be entered into the list located on the 'Add'
register page.  These additional commands are inserted into the
beginning of the group that will contain the dock item.  This feature
is particularly useful for including context menus with specific dock
items.

Command/Port Options
********************

   * COMMAND - if given, the command will be executed whenever the
     object is triggered (specific trigger is defined by the object
     type).  The command will be issued to the host port specified by
     the PORT argument.  Note that the command is run asyncronously (as
     a detached process) and only inherits the global path if `MUIRexx'
     is started from a shell.  The command text may contain a format
     specifier (`%s') in which case before issuing the command the
     format specifier will be replaced by a label whose content is
     dependant on the object type.

   * PORT - a specific host port may be specified by this argument.  The
     defined command will be issued to this port whenever the object is
     triggered.  If the port is defined as COMMAND then the command will
     be issued to a DOS shell (global path will be in affect only if
     `MUIRexx' was run from a shell).  If this argument is not given
     but a command is defined then the port will be defined as the port
     for `ARexx' (i.e.  it will be assumed that the command is an
     `ARexx' script).  Additionally, if the port is defined as INLINE
     then the command string will be treated as an inline `ARexx' macro
     string. Note also, that the port may be defined as the port of the
     application itself.  In this manner objects within an application
     can be linked as well as to objects in other applications.

   Many examples are given in the command reference section, however,
here are a few examples illustrating the use of the INLINE port option
(note that each line within the string macros must be terminated with a
semicolon).

MUI Format Sequences
********************

   Whenever MUI prints strings, they may contain some special character
sequences defining format, color and style of the text.

   * '\\n' Start a new line.  With this character you can e.g. create
     multi line buttons.

   * '\\033-' Disable text engine, following chars will be printed
     without further parsing.

   * '\\033u' Set the soft style to underline.

   * '\\033b' Set the soft style to bold.

   * '\\033i' Set the soft style to italic.

   * '\\033n' Set the soft style back to normal.

   * '\\033[n]' Use pen number n (2..9) as front pen.  n must be a valid
     DrawInfo pen as specified in "intuition/screens.h".

   * '\\033c' Center current (and following) line(s).  This sequence is
     only valid at the beginning of a string or after a newline
     character.

   * '\\033r' Right justify current (and following) line(s).  This
     sequence is only valid at the beginning of a string or after a
     newline character.

   * '\\033l' Left justify current (and following) line(s).  This
     sequence is only valid at the beginning of a string or after a
     newline character.

   * '\\033I[[s]]' Draw MUI image with specification [s] (see
     @{"MUI Image Specifications" Link "MUI Image Specifications"}).

MUI Image Specifications
************************

   MUI Image specifications always starts with a digit, followed by a
':', followed by some parameters.  Currently, the following things are
defined:

   * "0:[x]" where [x] is between MUII_BACKGROUND and MUII_FILLBACK2
     identifying a builtin pattern.

   * "1:[x]" where [x] identifies a builtin standard image.  Don't use
     this, use "6:[x]" instead.

   * "2:[r],[g],[b]" where [r], [g] and [b] are 32-bit RGB color values
     specified as 8-digit hex string (e.g.  00000000 or ffffffff). 
     Kick 2.x users will get an empty image.

   * "3:[n]" where [n] is the name of an external boopsi image class.

   * "4:[n]" where [n] is the name of an external MUI brush.

   * "5:[n]" where [n] is the name of an external picture file that
     should be loaded with datatypes.  Kick 2.x users will get an empty
     image.

   * "6:[x]" where [x] is between MUII_WindowBack (0) and MUII_Count-1
     (41) identifying a preconfigured image/background.

MUI List Format
***************

   MUI has the ability to handle multi column lists.  To define how many
columns should be displayed and how they should be formatted, you
specify a format string.

   This format string must contain one entry for each column you want
to see. Entries are separated by commas with each line parsed via
dos.library/ReadArgs().

   The template for a single entry looks like this:

   DELTA=D/N, PREPARSE=P/K, WEIGHT=W/N, MINWIDTH=MIW/N, MAXWIDTH=MAW/N,
COL=C/N, BAR/S

   * DELTA - Space in pixel between this column and the next.  the last
     displayed column ignores this setting.  Defaults to 4.

   * PREPARSE - A preparse value for this column.  Setting this e.g.  to
     '\\033c' would make the column centered (see @{"MUI Format Sequences" Link "MUI Format Sequences"}).

   * WEIGHT - The weight of the column.  As with MUI's group class,
     columns are layouted with a minimum size, a maximum size and
     weight.  A column with a weight of 200 would gain twice the space
     than a column with a weight of 100.  Defaults to 100.

   * MINWIDTH - Minimum percentage width for the current column.  If
     your list is 200 pixel wide and you set this to 25, your column
     will at least be 50 pixel.  The special value -1 for this
     parameter means that the minimum width is as wide as the widest
     entry in this column.  This ensures that every entry will be
     completely visible (as long as the list is wide enough).  Defaults
     to -1.

   * MAXWIDTH - Maximum percentage width for the current column.  If
     your list is 200 pixel wide and you set this to 25, your column
     will not be wider as 50 pixel.  The special value -1 for this
     parameter means that the maximum width is as wide as the widest
     entry in this column.  Defaults to -1.

   * COL - This value adjusts the number of the current column.  This
     allows you to adjust the order of your columns.  Defaults to
     current entry number (0,1,...)

   * BAR - Since muimaster.library V11, you can enable a vertical bar
     between this and the next column by using this switch.

   If your list object gets so small there is not enough place for the
minwidth of a column, this column will be hidden completely and the
remaining space is distributed between the remaining columns.  This is
not true if the column is the first column, in this case the entries
will simply be clipped.

   Note:  You will have as many columns in your list as entries in the
format string (i.e.  number of commas + 1).  Empty entries, e.g.  with
a format string of ",,,," are perfectly ok.

   The default list format is an empty string (""), this means a one
column list without special formatting.

   For a dirlist object the column data, starting at column zero (0),
is the file name, size, date, time, protection, and comment.

Attribute TAGs
**************

   While the capability to specify arbitrary attributes allows for much
flexibility it also can lead to unexpected results.  It is recommended
that before using a TAG that the MUI and AmigaOS autodocs be referenced
in order to clearly understand the effect the TAG will have.  All TAGs
are set by specifying a TAG id and value pair.  Any number of TAG pairs
may be given. TAG ids should be given as hexidecimal numbers (preceded
by a `0x'), although decimal numbers may also be used.  Typically, TAG
ids should be assigned to an `ARexx' variable for script clarity.  TAG
values may be either decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers, strings (the
value will be assumed to be a string if it is not recognized as a
number) or string arrays (specified by starting with a period (.) and
separating each string with a comma (,).  A TAG value can be forced to
be interpreted as a string by prepending the string with an equal
symbol (=).  Note that all TAGs indicated with an `i' flag can be set
at object creation.  The `s' flag indicates a TAG that can be set after
object creation and the `g' indicates a TAG that can be retrieved.  To
retrieve a TAG value just specify the TAG id alone.  The TAG value will
be returned in the `ARexx' variable RESULT.

   For commands that allow specification of attribute TAGs some example
TAGs are given with the command description.  However, it may be
possible (even probable) that other TAGs may be usable.  It is
therefore highly recommended that the MUI class autodocs be consulted. 
These autodocs may be found in the MUI developers archive.
