  In this archive, there should be the following files:

          mem.doc          3594 bytes
          mem.c            6801 bytes
          mem.h             523 bytes


    Ever had the problem of a program you're trying to debug swallowing
  24 bytes somewhere, and not knowing where? Or perhaps you're playing
  around with one of the more complex memory structures, and it gurus
  a lot due to incorrect memory frees? Painful to debug, aren't they?

    Well, no longer!! With these two teeny files, your programs will crash
  from memory mismanagement never again!

    mem.c provides a safety net around all your calls to AllocMem and
  FreeMem, recording what you've allocated, and where you allocated (ie
  where in the source-code). Then, when you do something wrong (like try to
  free something you never allocated), it simply displays a nice little
  debug message like this:

hello.c 44: Incorrect free size. (64 instead of 2300)

  or this:

hello.c 45: Free twice (?). ($34, 2478756)

    There must be very few Amiga programmers out there who haven't
  had the "Free Twice" guru!


    mem.c also provides a mechanism to find out just what you haven't
  gotten around to freeing yet (you've been -meaning- to for ages...):


hello.c 76: Memory List

    Address      Size        File           Line
    -------      ----        ----           ----
    $123450      24          hello.c        42
    $200000      4500        there.c        97


  Useful, eh? But that's not all!! Gone are the days when you have to
  reboot your computer every time your rogue program eats up all your
  precious memory; A simple call will free everything you allocated!

    Ok, enough of the advertisement; here's how to do it:

  Simply #include "mem.h" (make sure you put that AFTER #include
  "proto/exec.h" !!!!!!). Link with mem.o, and place calls to
  ShowMemList() and ClearMemList() where-ever you feel appropriate. (At the
  end of main() is the most obvious place, though the more industrious
  could put the calls in break & exit traps.)

    To find out how it works, read the extensive documentation in mem.c.

                You are free to do whatever you like with
                this software, so long as you give credit
                where credit is due.

                If you find it useful (like it saves you
                3 days of debugging time), send whatever
                you feel appropriate  ($10 would be most
                welcome!).

                I would be very  interested  to here any
                comments,  suggestions,  and  flames you
                may have.  (Please,  dont  take  it upon
                yourself  to   point  out  my   spelling
                errors!).
