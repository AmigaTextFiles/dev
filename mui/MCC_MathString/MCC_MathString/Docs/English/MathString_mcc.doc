  Welcome to MathString 1.5
  -------------------------

  MathString is a MUI custom class that adds mathematical abilities
to the usual String class.

  A MathString object can accept complex floating-point expression,
including algebraic operators, functions, measuring units and
costants, returning only the final result to the application.  It is
highly customizable allowing for different reactions on errors,
custom functions, constants and measuring units.



  Expression Syntax
  -----------------

  When dealing with a MathString object, you can input any numeric
quantity as a floating point number (in standard or exponential
notation) with an optional measuring unit. The set of available
measuring units depends on the application and the kind of value you
are requested to enter in the MathString object (lenght, time,
weight, speed, currency...). If no measuring unit is given,
MathString assumes for it the default one (usually this is the one
you see converted the result to when you confirm your entry). You can
also work with absolute numbers if no measuring unit was requested;
in this case, just use simple floating-point values without any unit.

  Assuming a "computer memory" measuring system, with "b"=byte as the
default unit, the following are thus valid "numbers":

     256	  256    bytes
     .5 Kb	  512    bytes
     1.5e3 b	 1500    bytes
     2e-2 Mb	20971.52 bytes


  MathString accepts algebraic notation more or less how you would
expect it: you can use the four operators +, -, * and / in the usual
infix notation, and () parentheses to indicate subexpressions.

  Examples:

     100 b + .5 Kb	 612 bytes
     2*(1Kb-1)		2046 bytes


  Constants are denoted by their names, and functions immediately
precede their parenthesized argument:

     pi				3.141592...
     sin(90°)			1.0
     1+sin(pi/2)		2.0
     sqrt(1+1)*sqrt(4/2)	2.0

  As you can see, a MathString object gives real expressive power to the user
without burdening the application at all.



  Distribution conditions
  -----------------------

  MathString is (C) 1996 V. Gervasi, but freely distributable as long
as the following conditions are met:


1.  If you use MathString in a commercial or shareware product, you
have to send me a full (registered) package (copy) of the product,
including any update that still uses MathString.mcc. Also, the text
"MathString (C) 1996 V. Gervasi" should go in your printed
documentation, if any.

2.  If you use MathString in a PD product, you only have to put the
text "MathString (C) 1996 V. Gervasi" in your "About" window OR in
the same place where the "MUI (C) Stefan Stuntz" text is OR in the
documentation. With MUI 3.6, this condition is automatically
satisfied if you use the standard "About MUI..." requester.


  In any case, I would appreciate an e-mail announcing the product.
Provided that the above mentioned conditions are met, you can
distribute MathString with your product, having care not to overwrite
any later MathString.mcc the user could have already installed.
