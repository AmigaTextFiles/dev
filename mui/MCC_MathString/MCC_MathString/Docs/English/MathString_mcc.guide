  @{b}@{u}Welcome to MathString 1.5@{ub}@{uu}


  MathString is a @{" MUI " link MUI} custom class that adds mathematical abilities
to the usual String class.


  A MathString object can accept complex floating-point expression, including
algebraic operators, functions, measuring units and costants, returning only
the final result to the application.  It is highly customizable allowing for
different reactions on errors, custom functions, constants and measuring
units.

  MUI is an object oriented system to create and maintain graphical user
interfaces.  From a programmers point of view, using MUI saves a lot of
time and makes life much easier.  Thinking about complicated terms like
window resizing or font sensitivity is simply not neccesary.


  On the other hand, users of MUI based applications have the ability to
customize nearly every pixel of a programs interface according to their
personal taste.

@node SYNTAX "MathString Expression Syntax"
@tab 30


  @{b}@{u}Expression Syntax@{ub}@{uu}


  When dealing with a MathString object, you can input any numeric quantity
as a @{b}floating point number@{ub} (in standard or exponential notation) with an
optional @{b}measuring unit@{ub}. The set of available measuring units depends on
the application and the kind of value you are requested to enter in the
MathString object (lenght, time, weight, speed, currency...).
If no measuring unit is given, MathString assumes for it the default one
(usually this is the one you see converted the result to when you confirm
your entry). You can also work with absolute numbers if no measuring unit
was requested; in this case, just use simple floating-point values without
any unit.


  Assuming a "computer memory" measuring system, with "b"=byte as the default
unit, the following are thus valid "numbers":


     256	@{i}  256    bytes @{ui}

     .5 Kb	@{i}  512    bytes @{ui}

     1.5e3 b	@{i} 1500    bytes @{ui}

     2e-2 Mb	@{i}20971.52 bytes @{ui}


  MathString accepts algebraic notation more or less how you would expect it:
you can use the four operators @{b}+@{ub}, @{b}-@{ub}, @{b}*@{ub} and @{b}/@{ub} in
the usual infix notation, and @{b}()@{ub} parentheses to indicate subexpressions.


  Examples:


     100 b + .5 Kb	@{i}  612 bytes @{ui}

     2*(1Kb-1)	@{i} 2046 bytes @{ui}



  @{b}Constants@{ub} are denoted by their names, and @{b}functions@{ub} immediately precede
their parenthesized argument:


     pi	@{i}3.141592... @{ui}

     sin(90°)	@{i}1.0 @{ui}

     1+sin(pi/2)	@{i}2.0 @{ui}

     sqrt(1+1)*sqrt(4/2)	@{i}2.0 @{ui}


  As you can see, a MathString object gives real expressive power to the user
without burdening the application at all.

@node DISTRIB "MathString Distribution Conditions"


  @{b}@{u}Distribution conditions@{ub}@{uu}


  MathString is (C) 1996 V. Gervasi, but freely distributable as long
as the following conditions are met:


@{b}@{i}1.@{ub}@{ui}  If you use MathString in a commercial or shareware product, you
have to send me a full (registered) package (copy) of the product,
including any update that still uses MathString.mcc.
Also, the text "MathString (C) 1996 V. Gervasi" should go in your
printed documentation, if any.


@{b}@{i}2.@{ub}@{ui}  If you use MathString in a PD product, you only have to put the text
"MathString (C) 1996 V. Gervasi" in your "About" window OR in the same
place where the "MUI (C) Stefan Stuntz" text is OR in the documentation.
@{i}With MUI 3.6, this condition is automatically satisfied if you use the
standard "About MUI..." requester.@{ui}


  In any case, I would appreciate an e-mail announcing the product.
Provided that the above mentioned conditions are met, you can distribute
MathString with your product, having care not to overwrite any later
MathString.mcc the user could have already installed.
