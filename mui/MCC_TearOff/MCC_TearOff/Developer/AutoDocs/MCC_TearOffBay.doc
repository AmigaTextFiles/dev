TearOffBay.mcc/TearOffBay.mcc

This class can hold some TearOffPanels and allows the user to
arrange them with mouse (and menu).

The layout is stored during MUIM_Application_Save (you have to
define ObjectID for the Bay _AND_ for every panel that should be
remembered). You don't have to make any special configuration
options, just add the panels and your user will choose what
(s)he likes!

The panels are simply children of the bay. They should be defined
at creation time ('MUIA_Group_Child' or 'Child').
Dynamic adding/removing is NOT suported at the moment.

NEW in V13:
 - horizontal and vertical layout
 - panels can be fixed to any bay in the set of linked bays

still missing:
 - localization
 - something more?

TearOff classes are Polymorphware. That means, if you use it in your program,
you have to pay/send me what you expect from your users, eg. if it is
'Chocolateware' you should send me a bar of chocolate. Freeware programs
can use TearOff for free, of course.

TearOffBay.mcc/MUIA_TearOffBay_Horiz

    NAME
	MUIATearOffBay_Horiz -- [I..], BOOL

    FUNCTION
   Layout type for the bay.
   Default is TRUE that means horizontal layout.

TearOffBay.mcc/MUIA_TearOffBay_LinkedBay

    NAME
	MUIA_TearOffBay_LinkedBay -- [ISG], 

    FUNCTION
   The user can move the panels between the bays if the bays
   are linked.
   If you are using ObjectID's to store the layout, the bays
   should be already linked when you call Application_Load!
    

    EXAMPLE
   You can link many bays in one call:

	SetAttrs(firstbay,MUIA_TearOffBay_LinkedBay,secondbay,
		MUIA_TearOffBay_LinkedBay,thirdbay,
		MUIA_TearOffBay_LinkedBay,fourthbay,0);


    BUGS
   Currently there is no way to unlink the bays.
   This means you should dispose a whole set of linked bays.
   If only one bay is disposed, the remaining ones become invalid!
   In common cases (all bays are in one window) it will not cause
   any problems.
