Overview
********

   What is Mailtext?

   Mailtext is a Custom Class for the Magic User Interface (MUI) by
Stefan Stuntz.

   It should be used whenever a MUI program has to display electronic
messages, i.e. eMail or News.

   In "e-messages", you will often find words enclosed i.e. by '*' oder
'_' like this: *bold*, _underlined_. By using Mailtext instead of MUI's
Floattext-Class the text enclosed by these attributecharacters will be
printed with the appropriated textstyle, so

   @{b}*@{ub} *text* will be printed boldface

   @{b}*@{ub} /text/ will be printed italics

   @{b}*@{ub} _text_ will be underlined

   @{b}*@{ub} #text# will be printed in another color, which can be freely
     configured in MUI-Prefs/Mailtext.

   The processing of attributecharacters will be disabled if Mailtext
recognises uuencoded files, signatures, PGP-Signatures, -Keys and
-Messages.

   But that's not the only thing Mailtext can do:

   It may also highlight quoted textpassages -- with different colors
for up to five levels of quote.

   Uniform Resource Locators (URL) are recognized by Mailtext and you
can configure an action that will be triggered whenever the user
doubleclicks an URL, i.e. start an AmigaDOS-Command or an ARexx-Script
to forward the URL to your favorite Webbrowser.

   Signature marks, i.e. '-- ', can be replaced by a horizontal line,
so the signature appears more separated from the messagetext.

   Most features of Mailtext may be @{"configured" Link "Configuration"} to fit your needs.

   @{b}*@{ub} If you purchased this software the normal way from a Public domain

Configuration
*************

   Most features of Mailtext may be configured to fit your needs in the
Mailtext section of MUI-Prefs. All elements make use of MUI's Bubblehelp
system, so just some essential notes can be found here.


 @{" Chars page " Link "Chars page"}         Special characters
 @{" Distances page " Link "Distances page"}     Attribute- and Quotedistance
 @{" URLs page " Link "URLs page"}          Uniform Resource Locators

@Toc "Configuration"

Chars page
==========

   An important thing to know when configuring Mailtext is what is
meant with "introducing char" and "terminating char", so please have a
look at the following example (let + be one of the attribute characters
'*', '/', '_' or '#'):

        +Text+
        ^    ^
        |    |
        |    +- the terminating char
        |
        +- the introducing char

   With this is mind, it should be pretty easy to configure Mailtext to
your needs.


@EndNode

@Node "Distances page" "Mailtext_mcc.guide/Distances page"
@Toc "Configuration"

Distances page
==============

   The quote distance configures Mailtext's recognition of quoted
textpassages.

   However, with multiple quotelevels it's a little more tricky, so
let's have a look at the following example:

     XYZ> ABC> Quoted text
        ^    ^
     123412345

   With a quote distance <= 3 the text will not be highlighted at all,
as the first quote character is the fourth character of the line.

   With a quote distance of 4 the whole text will be highlighted with
the level 1 color, level 2 is not recognized.

   With a quote distance >= 5, also the second quotelevel would be
recognized, as the second quotechar is the fifth charater behind the
first quote character.

   Too complicated? I don't hope so ... ;-)


@EndNode

@Node "URLs page" "Mailtext_mcc.guide/URLs page"
@Toc "Configuration"

URLs page
=========

   The URL action is a normal AmigaDOS command as i.e. entered in a
Shell window. So you have to use 'rx' to start ARexx scripts.

   The first @{b}%s@{ub} in the URL action command will be replaced by the URL
you have double clicked.

   Mailtext recognizes the following URLs (described in RFC 1738):

     @{b}file://@{ub} - Host-specific file names

     @{b}ftp://@{ub} - File Transfer protocol

     @{b}gopher://@{ub} - The Gopher protocol

     @{b}http://@{ub} - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (World Wide Web)

     @{b}mailto:@{ub} - Electronic mail address

     @{b}news:@{ub} - USENET news

     @{b}nntp://@{ub} - USENET news using NNTP access

     @{b}prospero://@{ub} - Prospero Directory Service

     @{b}telnet://@{ub} - Reference to interactive sessions

     @{b}wais://@{ub} - Wide Area Information Servers

   However you cannot configure an action string for each URL type as
this can be done by a "wrapper" ARexx script.

Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

   @{b}Question@{ub}: In MUI-Prefs/Mailtext I have selected "Separate
Signatures" on the @{b}Misc.@{ub} page but it doesn't seem to work. Why?

   @{b}Answer@{ub}: Most likely the signature separators '-- ', '--' or '---'
are part of your disable pattern (see @{b}Patterns@{ub} page). Remove them from
the pattern and everything will work fine. In pre 3.0 versions of
Mailtext the signature separators '-- ' and '---' were part of the
disable pattern by default.

                            @{b}* * *@{ub}

   @{b}Question@{ub}: Multiple attributes, i.e. _*/This/*_, don't seem to work.
Why?

   @{b}Answer@{ub}: I guess you have (again) been using a pre 3.0 Mailtext
version? You should add the characters *_#/ to the whitespace- and
terminating-chars and remove them from the nonintroducing-chars (see
@{b}Chars@{ub} page in MUI-Prefs/Mailtext).

                            @{b}* * *@{ub}

   @{b}Question@{ub}: When the mousepointer is above the Mailtext, I cannot
access the application's menus via keyboard shortcuts. I have to move
the mouse outside the Mailtext's area. What's that?

   @{b}Answer@{ub}: This is a MUI problem/feature. If an object has a context
menu and the mousepointer is above that object, the application's menus
cannot be accessed via shortcuts. Perhaps a future MUI will change this,
MUI 3.8 -- the current version while writing this -- still has this
behaviour. That's the reason, why Mailtext's contextmenu can be switched
off in MUI-Prefs/Mailtext on the @{b}Misc.@{ub} page.

Mailtext v3.0 (4.3.97)
======================

     Mailtext.mcc v18.12, Mailtext.mcp v18.4

        @{b}*@{ub} Mailtext is now derived from NList.mcc, so it takes advantage
          of some neat features of NList, making the new features below
          possible. Thanks to Gilles Masson for the NList package!

        @{b}*@{ub} It is now possible to mark text with the mouse and copy it to
          the clipboard (NList feature).

        @{b}*@{ub} Each mailtext object can now have a contextmenu with the
          following entries:

             - copy selected text to clipboard.

             - display the raw text instead of the processed.

             - switch wordwrapping

        @{b}*@{ub} Colors can now be configured for up to 5 different levels of
          quoted text and also for the '#' attribute.

        @{b}*@{ub} Multiple attributes (like i.e. _*/Text/*_) are supported
          correctly now. Therefore, you have to add the characters *_#/
          to the whitespace- and terminating-chars and remove them from
          the nonintroducing-chars.

        @{b}*@{ub} URLs may be highlighted. It is also possible to configure an
          action -- i.e. start a webbrowser -- that will be triggered
          when an URL in the text is doubleclicked. Mailtext recognizes
          all URL types specified in RFC 1738 "Uniform Resource
          Locators", Section 3.

        @{b}*@{ub} signature marks ('--', '-- ' and '---') will now optionally
          be replaced by a horizontal line.

        @{b}*@{ub} Wordwrapping for long lines can optionally be switched off:
          if the Mailtext object is contained in an NListview, a
          horizontal scrollbar will be display instead. With MUI's
          Listview this is of course not possible.

        @{b}*@{ub} Removed '-- ' and '--- ' from the default disable pattern,
          so you will see i.e. URLs in signatures and enable the
          signature separation feature.

        @{b}*@{ub} The state of the checkmarks in the .mcp was not saved
          correctly. Fixed.

        @{b}*@{ub} some bugfixes.

        @{b}*@{ub} API changes (refer to Autodoc):

             - the behaviour of MUIA_Mailtext_IncPercent changed
               slightly.

             - new: MUIA_Mailtext_ActionURL         [..G]

Mailtext v3.1 (26.7.98)
=======================

     Mailtext.mcc v19.8, Mailtext.mcp v19.8

        @{b}*@{ub} mailto:-URLs are no longer triggered as URLs but as
          email-addresses (without the mailto: part of course).

        @{b}*@{ub} added support for THOR tags <sb> and <tsb> (horizontal line
          with optionally centered text). They will only be recognized
          at the beginning of a line.

        @{b}*@{ub} lines starting with "actions" - i.e. <grin> - should no
          longer be considered as quote-lines.

        @{b}*@{ub} lines considered as signature separators (i.e. '- ') can now
          be configured via an AmigaDOS-pattern on the Patterns page of
          the .mcp.

        @{b}*@{ub} it is now possible to set the Font for the Mailtext object
          (see Misc page in prefs). This only works with NList 0.76+.

        @{b}*@{ub} the context menu's wordwrap checkmark state would sometimes
          have a wrong state.

        @{b}*@{ub} removed a workaround for an old (fixed) NList bug. The
          workaround caused a little incompatibility with recent NList
          versions and also with Mailtext usage in virtual groups.

        @{b}*@{ub} if MUI v20 (or higher) is detected, each configuration item
          in the .mcp now has an own contextmenu (like all the MUI
          items do have).

        @{b}*@{ub} API: implemented MUIA_Mailtext_ActionEMail. This notification
          will be triggered whenever the user doubleclicks an email
          address. You can use this to automatically open a "send mail
          to" dialog. See also show_mailtext.c in the developer archive.

        @{b}*@{ub} added a "Programming Guidelines" section to the autodocs.

        @{b}*@{ub} minor changes to show_mailtext

        @{b}*@{ub} now using MCCLib 12.4 by Kai Hofmann.

        @{b}*@{ub} recompiled with SAS/C 6.58.

Future
******

   The following features are still on my ToDo list for Mailtext,
although there's no guarantee that they'll ever be implemented. But
there's a way to influence me <hint> @{"Giftware" Link "Copyright"} <hint> :-)

   @{b}*@{ub} Replace text containing uuencoded data by a configurable picture
     and make decoding possible.

   @{b}*@{ub} Search for text.

   @{b}*@{ub} Recognize doubleclicks on e-mail addresses (without mailto:) and
     trigger an action just like with URLs.

   If you would see some more features in Mailtext don't hesitate to
contact the author.
