Release Notes
=============

v3.1 Beta 7 (16.11.97)

* mailto:-URLs are no longer triggered as URLs but as email-addresses
    (without the mailto: part of course).

* lines starting with "actions" -- i.e. <grin> -- should no longer be
    considered as quote-lines.

* added a "Programming Guidelines" section to the autodocs.

---

v3.1 Beta 6 (30.10.97)

* it is now possible to set the Font for the Mailtext object (see Misc page
    in prefs). This only works with NList 0.76+.

* API: implemented MUIA_Mailtext_ActionEMail. This notification will be
    triggered whenever the user doubleclicks an email address. You can use
    this to automatically open a "send mail to" dialog. See also
    show_mailtext.c in the developer archive.

* now using MCCLib 12.4 by Kai Hofmann.

* recompiled with SAS/C 6.58.

---

v3.1 Beta 5 (21.7.97)

* now that NList 0.75+ supports it, <tsb> is rendered as a thick line. This
    may add a little trash with NList version lower than 0.75. Please
    upgrade.

---

v3.1 Beta 4 (20.6.97)

* lines considered as signature separators (i.e. '-- ') can now be
    configured via an AmigaDOS-pattern on the Patterns page of the .mcp.

* added support for THOR tags <sb> and <tsb> (horizontal line with
    optionally centered text). They will only be recognized at the
    beginning of a line. <tsb> is currently rendered like <sb>, as NList
    doesn't support thick lines yet.

---

v3.1 Beta 3 (21.5.97)

* removed a workaround for an old (fixed) NList bug. The workaround caused
    a little incompatibility with recent NList versions and also with
    Mailtext usage in virtual groups.

---

v3.1 Beta 2 (16.4.97)

* if MUI v20 (or higher) is detected, each configuration item in the .mcp
    now has an own contextmenu (like all the MUI items do have).

---

v3.1 Beta 1

* the context menu's wordwrap checkmark state would sometimes have a wrong
    state.

* minor changes to show_mailtext

---

v3.0 (4.3.97, Mailtext.mcc v18.12, Mailtext.mcp v18.4)

* minor changes and bugfixes since Beta 3.

---

v3.0 Beta 3 (31.1.97, Mailtext.mcc v18.9, Mailtext.mcp v18.3)

* when text is copied to the clipboard by using the contextmenu, it will be
    deselected afterwards.

* wordwrapping for long lines can optionally be switched off: if the
    Mailtext object is contained in an NListview, a horizontal scrollbar
    will be display instead. With MUI's Listview this is of course not
    possible. Another reason to switch to NListview :-)

* Mailtext is now derived directly from NList.mcc, making the wordwrapping
    feature possible.

* API changes (refer to Autodoc for explanation):
    + MUIA_Mailtext_Wordwrap [.SG]

---

v3.0 Beta 2 (29.1.97, Mailtext.mcc v18.6, Mailtext.mcp v18.2)

* if lines end with CR+LF, the CR will not be displayed anymore.

* signature marks ('--', '-- ' and '---') will now optionally be replaced
    by a horizontal line.

* the context menu now has a menuitem to display the raw text instead of
    the processed.

* API changes (refer to Autodoc for explanation):
    + MUIA_Mailtext_ActionURL   [..G]
    + MUIA_Mailtext_DisplayRaw  [.SG]

* some little bugfixes.

---

v3.0 Beta 1 (22.1.97, Mailtext.mcc v18.1, Mailtext.mcp v18.1)

* Mailtext is now derived from NFloattext.mcc (subclass of NList.mcc), so
    it takes advantage of some neat features of NList, making the new
    features below possible. Thanks to Gilles Masson for the NList package!

* It is now possible to mark text with the mouse and copy it to the
    clipboard (NList feature).

* Each mailtext object can now have a contextmenu, currently with only one
    entry to allow copying the selected text to clipboard. The menu can
    also be switched off in MUI-Prefs.

* Colors can now be configured for up to 5 different levels of quoted text
    and also for the '#' attribute.

* Multiple attributes (like i.e. _*/Text/*_) are supported correctly now.
    Therefore, you have to add the characters *_#/ to the whitespace- and
    terminating-chars and remove them from the nonintroducing-chars.

* URLs may be highlighted. It is also possible to configure an action --
    i.e. start a webbrowser -- that will be triggered when an URL in the
    text is doubleclicked. Mailtext recognizes all URL types specified in
    RFC 1738 "Uniform Resource Locators", Section 3.

* The state of the checkmarks in the .mcp was not saved correctly. Fixed.

* Removed '-- ' and '--- ' from the default disable pattern, so you will
    also see i.e. URLs in signatures.

* API changes:
     * the behaviour of MUIA_Mailtext_IncPercent changed slightly
     + MUIA_Mailtext_ForbidContextMenu [I..]

---

v2.2 (19.11.96, Mailtext.mcc v17.70, Mailtext.mcp v17.54)

* should handle i.e. Unix paths (i.e. /home/users/olf/) in messages a
    little smarter now. With previous versions, that example would have
    been printed in italics, now no attribute will be set.

* switched from mccheader.c to MCCLib.c (thanks to Kai Hofmann, great
    work!)

* version for MC68020 (and above) included.

* fixed some bugs in Mailtext.mcp that could occur in low-memory
    situations.

---

v2.1 (10.11.96, Mailtext.mcc v17.58, Mailtext.mcp v17.40)

* when attribute parsing has been disabled (by matching the disable
    pattern), no text was copied at all, resulting in i.e. lost signatures.

* now using MCC-Install 43.4

* compiled with SAS/C 6.57

* polish catalog, thanks to Marcin Orlowski.

---

v2.0 (2.11.96, Mailtext.mcc v17.41, Mailtext.mcp v17.28)

* ported Mailtext from Modula-2 to C:
     - Mailtext now completely complies with the guidelines for
       MUI Custom Classes
     - now needs MUI 3.6, support for older MUI versions has
       been removed.
     - the classes are app. 50% smaller.
     - compiled with SAS/C 6.56.

* API did *not* change. No need to request a new developer
  package.

---

v1.0 (5.6.96, Mailtext.mcc v10.196, Mailtext.mcp v14.2)
