Sunday    21-Sep-2014 (megacz) 1.2

Bugfix/new features release. See  changelogs/readmes/etc  for more details.
PLEASE UPDATE ALL THE TOOLS  YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY COPIED TO  'C:'  DIRECTORY
AS NEW LIBRARY RELEASE INDIRECTLY FIXES BUGS IN PROGS!  Summary of changes:
  * Leak-free memory allocator has been implemented under 'mem_xxxlfvec()'.

  * New  public macros  have  been added  (see 'qdev_macros.txt' for more):
  QDEV_HLP_FLIP(), QDEV_HLP_REMOTE(), QDEV_HLP_DELTAITER(), QDEV_HLP_NEG(),
  QDEV_HLP_DELTASCAN(), QDEV_HLP_LCOPYMEM() .

  * There are two  new video related tools in the package namely: 'palhack'
  and 'modeidctrl'.

  * Improved  and/or  fixed  tools: 'minism', 'ktm', 'hashlab', 'multisum'.

  * Added QCRT compact startup code and companion subsystems that sit under
  'crt_#?' prefix.

  * Added two text  related functions: 'txt_parseline()', 'txt_fixquotes()'
  and improved: 'txt_vpsnprintf()'.  

  * QCLI extension in library loader ('a-pre_xxxlibs.h') has been modified.
  The seglist is now loaded only once.

  * Fixed: 'ctl_newshell()',  'ctl_openconscreen()', 'ctl_addbartrigger()',
  'a-ctl_xxxconlogof.c' . 

  * Added: 'ctl_setconlogof()'  which allows  to control aspects of logo as
  loaded from file.

  * Added: 'nfo_scanturbo()' a mass  list scanner  based on delta iterator.

  * Added: 'mem_signalsafe()'  which allows  to singal tasks in a safe way.

  * Added new subsystem: 'mem_xxxsniffer()' that allows to sniff on message
  ports without hacking on them.

  * Added: 'nfo_getconioreq()'  to have  access to low-level message of the
  console handler.

  * Fixed/improved  'a-mem_xxxhandler.c'.  Native code handling was broken.
  Added remote slot management.

  * Added: 'mem_resolvehotvec()' to Hot Vector Array project. It's possible
  to identify pointers now.

  * Added 128bit FNV hash routines: 'mem_fnv128hash()', 'txt_fnv128hash()',
  'txt_fnv128ihash()'.

  * Implemented LBS(Local Base Support) which is active by default. More on
  LBS  can  be found  in the  manual  and  autodocs. Functions related are:
  'mem_addrfrombase()',    'mem_setaddrjtslot()',    'mem_setdatajtslot()',
  'mem_allocjumptable()',   'mem_freejumptable()',   'mem_swapjumptable()',
  'mem_filljumptable()', 'mem_importjumptable()'.

  * Caution! As of this release cached bases that are available to the user
  through  numerous private structures,  no longer directly point at global
  bases! They are tied to  process local bases. You cannot just assign them
  you must QBASERESOLVE() them.



Sunday    05-Jan-2014 (megacz) 1.1

New features release. See Autodocs, Macros and headers for more details on:
  * 'mem_xxxhotvec()' function family that allows to install "hot vectors".

  * 'QDEV_HLP_DFUNC()' function driver macro (safier callbacks and hooks) .

  * Extended versioning of the library and tools. Try 'version <file> full'
  on the library and/or tools that come with the package.

  * Function aliases that [re]define the library  API in an Amiga-like way.

Function 'mod_codereloc()' has been fixed(crash-bug), see the changelog for
more. There is also new, fixed version of 'resmodinit'.



Friday    01-Nov-2013 (megacz) 1.0p3

This  release fixes two  relatively harmless bugs in FDR. See changelogs of
'a-dos_addfdrelay.c' and 'a-dos_ctrlfdrelay.c' for more.



Sunday    20-Oct-2013 (megacz) 1.0p2

Today's patch reimplements  workaround for broken console handlers that are
to be used with 'ctl_openconscreen()'. Changelog of  'a-ctl_xxxconscreen.c'
gives more info. This also means that fresh build of 'mss' is available.



Saturday  12-Oct-2013 (megacz) 1.0p1

This patch release fixes mainly Enforcer hits in  FDR, see changelog of the
'a-dos_addfdrelay.c'  for more details. This  also means a  fresh build  of
'amiscreen'.



Saturday  23-Feb-2013 (megacz) 1.0

At this  point it is certain that we will be unable to work on OS distro in
2013 due  to time organisation problems. Sorry...  Currently  all time that
left is being put into polishing the package before first public release.
