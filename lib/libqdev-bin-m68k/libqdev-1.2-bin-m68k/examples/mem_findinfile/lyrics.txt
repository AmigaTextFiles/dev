Monster In My Cadillac
---

There's something wrong in here
There's something strange in here
Something is very weird
I better get outside of here

There's something creapy in here
Must keep my senses clear
Wake me, wake me
I'm getting of this bit right here

There's something spooky going on, on
There's something think it might be

Hey, hey, hey * 2
Well there's a monster in my cadillac today

There's something wrong in here
Maybe I've gone on to long awake
Got to shake, now give me a break
Stop this thing right away

There's something going on
I can feel something is very wrong
Play with me, don't play with me
Stop this right now

There's something spooky in the air, air
It makes me resting (???) up my hair
Now do I care, yes I care, quit let me out of here

Get away, get away
Well there's a monster in my cadillac today
Go away, go awaaaaaaaaaay
well there's a monster in my cadillac today

Go awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Well there's a monster in my cadillac today
Go awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Well there's a monster in my cadillac today
