BLACK SALLY IMITABLE PACKAGE MARK Version 1, 15 July 2012

 Copyright (C) 2012 Burnt Chip Dominators


 This  license was created especially to cover  =Package=  and files related
 to it that cannot be released under the terms of GNU GPL temporarily. Other
 files may also fall under the terms of BSIPM license if told.

 This  license informs explicitly  what you are allowed to do with this very
 =Package=  and it's =Components= and/or =Binaries= and auxiliary files that
 are =Package=  related. Things not stated here are  considered out of scope
 and thus not allowed.

 The only legitimate copyright holders are 'Burnt Chip Dominators', which is
 to say the only legitimate  =Group= behind and in charge of this =Project=,
 =Package= and it's =Components= . All rights to decide about  the direction
 and future of the =Project= belong to the  =Group=  exclusively. All  other
 rights are reserved as well. All =Components=, except for the ones imported
 or contributed to the =Package= belong to the =Group= effectively.

 THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE  =Group=  AS IS AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES,  INCLUDING   BUT  NOT  LIMITED TO, THE  IMPLIED  WARRANTIES  OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. THERE
 IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE  =Components=, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY  AND PERFORMANCE OF THE =Components=
 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
 NECESSARY REPAIR.


Users

 Users are the group  of people(physically) who is considered  non-profiters
 and as  such they must not be  owners nor a part of  board of directors  of
 for-profit  organisations  who  wish to  make  profits  out  of  =Project=,
 =Package= and its =Components= .

1) Users  are given  the right  to download, store and depack the  =Package=
   incl. =Components=  as well as =Binaries=  on their own media but also to
   decompile, reverse-engineer, modify and use them  in the privacy of their
   own computers in any way, and for any purpose.

2) Users  are allowed to share modified =Components= and/or =Binaries= among
   other Users free of charge using zero-fee redistribution channels as long
   as all  changes are documented  and necessary  source code/disassembly is
   included. BSIPM  license should appear in the archive. If not, then short
   information about  free network resource that contains  it must really be
   provided.

3) Users are allowed to freely redistribute the  =Package= in unchanged form
   using  any channels,  provided  no  charge  will  be  obtained  for  that
   redistribution and the =Package=.


Coders

 Coders are the group of people(physically) who is considered engineers thus
 allowed to gain profits for their work. Coders similarily to Users must not
 be  owners nor workers of for-profit organisations who wish to make profits
 out of =Project=, =Package= and its =Components=.

1) Coders are  given exactly the same set of rights as Users have, plus some
   extras that can be found below.

2) Coders  are given the right to release  their source code that relates to
   the  =Project=  or  =Package=  under any license they want. They can also
   not include the source code at all.

3) Coders are granted the right to distribute their =Binaries=/software that
   was  linked against the  =Package=  or uses single  =Components=  free of
   charge. They  should include the  BSIPM document  in the archive of their
   non-commercial  product or  they must  point  out  network  resource that
   contains it. This is typically =Package=  site and/or free download link.

4) Coders can sell their work that is  =Project= or  =Package=  related in a
   detached state, which is to say that they must link against the =Package=
   on a  client's machine only. BSIPM license  inclusion is not necessary in
   this case.


NPOs

 NPOs are non-profit organisations. They can be of any form as  long as they
 decide on their own without  government/outside supervisory. NPOs  must not
 hire nor collaborate with  FPO members  whose aim is to exploit the ruleset
 as established in this file.

1) NPOs are given exactly the same rights as  Users have, with the exception
   below.

2) NPOs  are  allowed  to use the  =Package= and its =Components= as well as
   modified  =Components=  and/or =Binaries= or modified =Binaries= to power
   their non-profit business along with hosting them and making it available
   to the public, but they cannot sell resulting software to anyone.


FPOs

 FPOs are  for-profit  organisations(incl. their staff). Such  organisations
 can  act differently  according to the profile  and law in a given state or
 country, but they all agree that:

1) FPOs are banished temporarily, which  means they are granted no rights at
   present. Redistribution of  =Project=, =Package=  and its =Components= as
   well as hacking attempts(incl. rebranding) and use by FPOs is prohibited.

2) FPOs must not spoof as  Users  nor Coders  nor  NPOs nor  anyone else who
   would otherwise be authorized to make use of the =Project=, =Package= and
   its =Components=.


 If you do not agree with the above rules then go and tell  your mom and dad
 about it. Black Sally did put a spell on this distribution already. Changes
 to the meaning of this article are not welcome.
