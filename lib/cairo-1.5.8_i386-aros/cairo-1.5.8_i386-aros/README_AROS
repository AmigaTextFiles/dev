Type:         dev/lib
Version:      1.5.8
Requires:     dev/lib/pixman_i386-aros
Architecture: i386-aros


DESCRIPTION

  This is the AROS port of the Cairo 2D graphics library. 
  The package includes the static link library dor i386-aros 
  and the needed header files.

  Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.
  Currently supported output targets include the X Window System, win32, and image
  buffers. Experimental backends include OpenGL (through glitz), Quartz, XCB,
  PostScript and PDF file output.

  Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all output media while taking
  advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (eg. through the X
  Render Extension).

  The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript
  and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic Bézier
  splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text
  rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine
  transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)

  Cairo is implemented as a library written in the C programming language, but
  bindings are available for several different programming languages.


REQUIREMENTS

  Pixman link library. PNG and Z link library are optional but recommended.

  There might be a problem in combination with 'newer' versions of the 
  AROS PNG library. Things work fine with older ones.
