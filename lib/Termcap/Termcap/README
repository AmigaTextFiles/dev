This is the GNU termcap library -- a library of C functions that
enable programs to send control strings to terminals in a way
independent of the terminal type.  Most of this package is also
distributed with GNU Emacs, but it is available in this separate
distribution to make it easier to install as -ltermcap.

The GNU termcap library does not place an arbitrary limit on the size
of termcap entries, unlike most other termcap libraries.

To compile on Unix-like systems:

1.  Type `./configure'.  This shell script attempts to guess correct
values for various system-dependent variables used during compilation,
and creates the file `Makefile'.  This takes a minute or two.
On Ultrix 4.2, you have to run `configure' with sh5, bash, or ksh,
e.g., `sh5 configure'; `sh' doesn't work.

If you want to compile in a different directory from the one
containing the source code, `cd' to that directory and run `configure'
with the option `--srcdir=DIR', where DIR is the directory that
contains the source code.  The object files and library will be
put in the current directory.  This option only works with GNU make.
`configure' ignores any other arguments you give it.

If your system requires unusual options for compilation 
that `configure' doesn't know about, you can give `configure' initial
values for variables by setting them in the environment; in
Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that on the command line like
this:
$ CC='gcc -traditional' DEFS=-D_POSIX_SOURCE ./configure

2.  If you want to change the directories where the library and
documentation will be installed, or the optimization options, edit
`Makefile' and change those values.  If you have an unusual system
that needs special compilation options that `configure' doesn't know
about, and you didn't pass them in the environment when running
`configure', you should add them to `Makefile' now.  Alternately,
teach `configure' how to figure out that it is being run on a system
where they are needed, and mail the diffs to the address listed at the
end of this file so we can include them in the next release.

3.  Type `make'.

4.  If the library compiles successfully, type `make install' to
install it and the documentation.  If you need an /etc/termcap file,
you can get one from the Emacs `etc' directory, among many places.

5.  You can remove the object files from the source directory by
typing `make clean'.  Or type `make distclean' if you also want to
remove `Makefile', for instance if you are going to recompile next on
another type of machine.
