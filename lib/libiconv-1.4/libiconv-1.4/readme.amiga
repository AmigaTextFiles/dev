This is a port of libiconv 1.4, as static libraries for OS4, 68k and WarpOS.

It is ported using newlib for OS4, and -noixemul for 68k and WarpOS.
For all three I used gcc, for 68k it is the gcc from Stefan "Bebbo" Franke.
The 68k version is compiled for 68060 and using -ffast-math.
The WarpOS version is compiled with mos2wos gcc.
The OS4 version is also compiled with gcc.
