*
*   NOTES
*       I deem some functions obsolete.
*
*       All the GadTools layout code and support Functions are obsolete,
*       due to OS3.5 being released with Reaction/ClassAct. 
* 
*       I found it easier to convert a gui than to maintain it with my code :)
*       They remain in the archive and in the .lib's only because some programs
*       still need them to compile.
