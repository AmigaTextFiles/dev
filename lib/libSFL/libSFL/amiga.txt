Short:    Standard Function Library (SFL)
Author:   iMatrix (http://www.imatix.com/html/sfl/)
Uploader: ikepgh@yahoo.com (IKE)
Type: dev/lib
Requires: Amiga OS 68k / gcc
Version: 2.11

I've done a quick and dirty port of SFL from the sources available at the SFL hompage:

http://www.imatix.com/html/sfl/

I hope someone finds this useful.  All of the functions of this port have not been completely 
tested, so use it at your own risk.  No warranty is expressed or implied.

INTRODUCTION (from their website):

The Standard Function Library

The SFL (Standard Function Library) from iMatix is a portable function library for C/C++ programs. 
The SFL is the result of many years' development, and is provided as Open Source software for 
the benefit of the Internet community.

The SFL provides about 450 functions that cover these areas:

Compression, encryption, and encoding;
Datatype conversion and formatting;
Dates, times, and calendars;
Directory and environment access;
User and process groups;
Inverted bitmap indices;
Symbol tables;
Error message files;
Configuration files;
String manipulation and searching;
File access;
Internet socket access;
Internet programming (MIME, CGI);
SMTP (e-mail) access;
Server (batch) programming;
Program tracing.

The SFL is free software that you may use and distribute for private or commercial purposes according to the SFL License Agreement.

---------------------------------------------------------

CONTENTS:

libsfl.a:  gcc library for using SFL functions

'src' directory:  source code to rebuild the library and header files to compile other programs that use SFL

'tests' directory:   included test programs and source code  

'docs' directory:  readme files and complete html documentation from the original archive "sflbig21.tgz" 

'unused' directory:  included for distribution completeness

---------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

copy the library 'libsfl.a' in your development environment 'lib' directory
copy the 'sfl.h' header file located in the 'src' directory in your development environment 'include' directory

---------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO RECOMPILE:

1.  compile the c sources in the 'src' drawer as object files with the -c option:

    gcc -c *.c 

2.  build the library and name it as shown below:

    ar rcs libsfl.a *.o

3.  place the resulting 'libsfl.a' file in your development environment 'lib' directory

COMPILING THE TESTS:    

1.  compiling the tests and linking to the required library:
    
    gcc filename.c -lsfl -o filename

---------------------------------------------------------

MISSING FUNCTIONS:

I didn't have the time (or the patience) to rewrite these to compile, so the
library is missing 14 functions out of about 450!! (sorry....)

sfldate.c
gmt_to_local()
timezone_string()

sflfile.c
file_mode()
get_file_size()
get_file_time()

sfldir.c
format_mode()
format_name()
populate_entry()

sflenv.c
env2descr()
env2symb()
env_copy()

sflprocx.h
merge_environment()
restore_redirection()

sflproc.c
process_open_io()
