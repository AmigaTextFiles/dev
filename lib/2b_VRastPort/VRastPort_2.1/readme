Type:     dev/c
Version:  2.1

NEW IN v 2.1 - small bug in clipping routines fixed.

This is a linked library (in SAS/C format) of functions making drawing 2D
vectorial graphics easy. Library contains functions for drawing basic
primitives (pixels, lines, polygons, ellipses, rectangles) in virtual
coordinates system. Library automatically transfers primitives to RastPort
coordinates, does neccessary clipping and renders.

Features: - Virtual Carthesian coordinates system with 31-bit range of
            coordinates.
          - Independent x and y scaling.
          - No floating point math - it's fast and accurate.
          - Clipping works on non-layered RastPorts.
          - Automatic and intelligent handling of low-level stuff like
            TmpRas, invisible for library user.
          - Overriding chip-ram/blitter limitations.
          - System friendly - no hacks, should work on gfx boards (not tested
            yet).
          - Full source code, autodocs and example sources included.
          - Public Domain - use it in the way You want.
