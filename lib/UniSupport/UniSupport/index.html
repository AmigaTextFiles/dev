        <br>UniSupport Library: <a href="html/copyright.html">Copyright</a> 2008 Joerg van de Loo<br><br>
        This is a static library for the use with linkers and shall make it easier for you to encode/decode UTF-strings.<br><br>
        You should pay attention due to the fact that &quot;UniSupportLib&quot; is in a beta stage and with that, some bugs may surface that I've overlooked.<br><br>

        <u>Installation:</u><br>
        <br>
        Just copy &quot;unisupport.h&quot;, which can be found in the &quot;proto&quot; drawer, to your OS include-directory's &quot;proto&quot; drawer.<br>
        &quot;proto/unisupport.h&quot; contains all information required by your C-compiler in order to be used with the static libraries.<br>
        <b>Okay, I know that the information covered by &quot;proto/unisupport.h&quot; shouldn't be placed inside of the &quot;proto&quot; drawer, but then again, it makes installation far more easy</b>.<br>
        Once you did it, install the needed static libraries of your choice to your compiler's lib directory.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        That's all for now. I hope that these functions are of use for you and are illustrating how to make use of functions provided by UniLibrary.<br><br>
        Special thanks flow to:<br>
        Gianfranco Gignina for giving me a kick in the butt in order to start this project. Thanks, man...<br>
        Frank Wille, without his knowledge I certainly would still be studying some tool manuals...<br>
