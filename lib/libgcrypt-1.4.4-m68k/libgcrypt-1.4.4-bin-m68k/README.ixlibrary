ixlibrary notes
----------------

Programs in this package rely on libraries that can be used
under 48.3 of ixemul.library only. To change that, you have 
to grab 'ixidtools' and set new ID's(0-99) in the libraries! 
Be careful though, ID's must be unique in order for the proggy
to work properly and as far as i know ID's of 0-99 are already
exhausted! Refer to 'http://megacz.back2roots.org/A2IXREGISTRY'
for more info.
