v0.3: 11/21/2005
    - added BltAlphaBitMapRastPort()
    - added SDL_BlitAlphaSurfaceRastPort()
    - added WriteAlphaPixelArray() (cgx compatible call with alpha channel support)
    - added ExtractAlphaMask() - untested (create an 8bit bitmap out of alpha layer)
    - added InjectAlphaMask() - untested (inject an 8bit alpha mask into a 32bit bitmap)
    - changed all calls to match AmigaOS camel case naming convention (e.g. all "Bitmap" are now "BitMap")
    - added ablit_util ABU_InitVideo can now handle window or full screen mode.
    - added some more direct ARGB32 target blits (only with 32 bit source format for now).
v0.2: 11/05/2005
    - removed $VER tags from link library. Doesn't make sence in a link lib
    - fixed alignment exceptions (hope I got them all now), 16 bit blits should work now
    - cleaned up code into generic pattern. Adding a color format should
      now be only a matter of changeing some macro an no code changes any more -> easier maintenance.
    - fixed clipping bugs in 16/32 bit formats
    - removed C++ dependencies
    - lib is now independent from clib2 or newlib. Should run with both (libalib.a & libalib_utils.a)
      (need a clib2 version of freetype to test SDL_ttf, though)
    - restructured code for new functionality to yet come
v0.1: 10/31/2005
    - Forgot a debug message, slowed everything down
    - added $VER in ablit and ablit_utils lib
v0.0: 10/31/2005
    - First OS4Depot Release

TO DO:
    - separated 8 bit alpha channel bitmap/surface:
    - ExtractAlphaMask(), ApplyAlphaMask()
    - BltBitMapAlphaMask(), SDL_BlitSurfaceAlphaMask()
    - 32 bit target blits (16/24 bit source format missing)
    - 24 bit target blits
    - color key blits for source bitmaps < 32 bit
