@{b}The Nucifraga Link Library 1.0@{ub}

I am a big fan of link libraries for commonly used functions.  This is the
one I use in almost every piece of code I write.  I release it in hope that
in will be useful for someone else as well.

Nucifraga is freeware.  You may use it, learn from it, fix bugs, make
changes, and distribute your changed versions.

I take no responsibility for the use or misuse of this software.

@NODE Requirements

@{b}Requirements@{ub}

· I try to make my code ANSI, but much of it relies on SAS/C
  SAS/C 6.50 or higher.  You should be able to adapt it to GNU C,
  or at least to DICE.

· The V37 Kickstart and Workbench is needed for some of the modules,
  and enhances other.  Most are only tested with V39.

· V37 is needed for some constructions in the Makefile.

· some revision control software (like HWGRCS) is assumed
  (optional, but a great tool).

See the individual source files for details.

@NODE Installation

@{b}Installation@{ub}

You can install the library and header files wherever you please.  The
Makefile has an 'install' target which you may change to suit your needs.

@NODE Contents

@{b}Contents@{ub}

list
An object-oriented approach to lists (actually compatible with exec
MinLists).  Works on any system, thoroughly tested.

memory
Wrapper routines around exec memory allocation.  Adds some protection, e.g.
allocationg zero bytes, freeing NULL.  V33 and up.

pool
Memory pools under V39 _or_ V37 with nofrag.library.  Works well at least
under V39.

r250
A random number generator with good references (see the source file).
Also with a good ranged generator.

sprintf
RawDoFmt()-based sprintf()

statusclass
A BOOPSI gadget for displaying text, often attached to the bottom border.

I dedicate this piece of software to everybody who has authored great
software and released their works - including source - to the public.

Everybody must build on the works of their predecessors.
