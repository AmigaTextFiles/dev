  "765" is an emulation of the uPD765a (AKA Intel 8272) Floppy Disc Controller
[FDC] as used in Amstrad computers such as the PCW, CPC and Spectrum +3. At 
present it is not a "full" 765; features not used in the PCW BIOS (such as: 
DMA; multisector writes; multitrack mode) are either left unimplemented 
or incomplete.

  "765" is released under the GNU Library GPL.
