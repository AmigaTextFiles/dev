#
# PURPOSE OF THIS FILE:
#
# This file describes the capabilities of various character-cell terminals,
# as needed by software such as screen-oriented editors.
#
# Other terminfo and termcap files exist, supported by various OS vendors
# or as relics of various older versions of UNIX.  This one is the longest
# and most comprehensive one in existence.  It subsumes not only the entirety
# of the historical 4.4BSD, GNU, System V and SCO termcap files and the BRL
# termcap file, but also large numbers of vendor-maintained termcap and
# terminfo entries more complete and carefully tested than those in historical
# termcap/terminfo versions.
#
# Pointers to related resources (including the ncurses distribution) may
# be found at <http://www.tuxedo.org/terminfo>.
#
# INTERNATIONALIZATION:
#
# This file uses only the US-ASCII character set (no ISO8859 characters).
#
# This file assumes a US-ASCII character set. If you need to fix this, start
# by global-replacing \E(B and \E)B with the appropriate ISO 6429 enablers
# for your character set.  \E(A and \E)A enables the British character set
# with the pound sign at position 2/3.  
#
# In a Japanese-processing environment using EUC/Japanese or Shift-JIS,
# C1 characters are considered the first-byte set of the Japanese encodings,
# so \E)0 should be avoided in <enacs> and initialization strings.
#
# FILE FORMAT:
#
# The version you are looking at may be in any of three formats: master
# (terminfo with OT capabilities), stock terminfo, or termcap.  You can tell
# which by the format given in the header above.
#
# The master format is accepted and generated by the terminfo tools in the
# ncurses suite; it differs from stock (System V-compatible) terminfo only
# in that it admits a group of capabilities (prefixed `OT') equivalent to
# various obsolete termcap capabilities.  You can, thus, convert from master
# to stock terminfo simply by filtering with `sed "/OT[^,]*,/s///"'; but if
# you have ncurses `tic -I' is nicer (among other things, it automatically
# outputs entries in a canonical form).
#
# The termcap version is generated automatically from the master version
# using tic -C.  This filtering leaves in the OT capabilities under their
# original termcap names.  All translated entries fit within the 1023-byte
# string-table limit of archaic termcap libraries except where explicitly
# noted below.  Note that the termcap translation assumes that your termcap
# library can handle multiple tc capabilities in an entry. 4.4BSD has this
# capability.  Older versions of GNU termcap, through 1.3, do not. 
#
# For details on these formats, see terminfo(5) in the ncurses distribution,
# and termcap(5) in the 4.4BSD Unix Programmer's Manual.  Be aware that 4.4BSD
# curses has been declared obsolete by the caretakers of the 4.4BSD sources
# as of June 1995; they are encouraging everyone to migrate to ncurses.
#
# Note: unlike some other distributed terminfo files (Novell Unix & SCO's),
# no entry in this file has embedded comments.  This is so source translation
# to termcap only has to carry over leading comments.  Also, no name field
# contains embedded whitespace (such whitespace confuses rdist).
#
# Further note: older versions of this file were often installed with an editor
# script (reorder) that moved the most common terminal types to the front of
# the file.  This should no longer be necessary, as the file is now ordered
# roughly by type frequency with ANSI/VT100 and other common types up front.
#
# Some information has been merged in from terminfo files distributed by
# USL and SCO (see COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS below).  Much information
# comes from vendors who maintain official terminfos for their hardware
# (notably DEC and Wyse).
#
# A detailed change history is included at the end of this file.
#
# FILE ORGANIZATION:
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry (this feature had to be sacrificed in order
# to allow standard terminfo and termcap syntax to be generated cleanly from
# the master format).  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.  The intent of the divisions is
# (a) to make it easier to find things, and (b) to order the database so
# that important and frequently-encountered terminal types are near the
# front (so that you'll get reasonable search efficiency from a linear
# search of the termcap form even if you don't use reorder).  Minor sections
# usually correspond to manufacturers or standard terminal classes. 
# Parenthesized words following manufacturer names are type prefixes or
# product line names used by that manufacturers.
#
# HOW TO READ THE ENTRIES:
#
# The first name in an entry is the canonical name for the model or
# type, last entry is a verbose description.  Others are mnemonic synonyms for
# the terminal.
#
# Terminal names look like <manufacturer> <model> - <modes/options>
# The part to the left of the dash, if a dash is present, describes the
# particular hardware of the terminal.  The part to the right may be used
# for flags indicating special ROMs, extra memory, particular terminal modes,
# or user preferences.
#
# All names should be in lower case, for consistency in typing.
#
# The following are conventionally used suffixes:
#	-2p	Has two pages of memory.  Likewise 4p, 8p, etc.
#	-am	Enable auto-margin.
#	-m	Monochrome.  Suppress color support
#	-mc	Magic-cookie.  Some terminals (notably older Wyses) can
#		only support one attribute without magic-cookie lossage.
#		Their base entry is usually paired with another that
#		uses magic cookies to support multiple attributes.
#	-nam	No auto-margin - suppress :am: capability
#	-nl	No labels - suppress soft labels
#	-ns	No status line - suppress status line
#	-rv	Terminal in reverse video mode (black on white)
#	-s	Enable status line.
#	-vb	Use visible bell (:vb:) rather than :bl:.
#	-w	Wide - in 132 column mode.
# If a name has multiple suffixes and one is a line height, that one should 
# go first.  Thus `aaa-30-s-rv' is recommended over `aaa-s-rv-30'.  
# 
# Entries with embedded plus signs are designed to be included through use/tc
# capabilities, not used as standalone entries. 
#
# To avoid search clashes, some older all-numeric names for terminals have
# been removed (i.e., "33" for the Model 33 Teletype, "2621" for the HP2621).
# All primary names of terminals now have alphanumeric prefixes.
#
# Comments marked "esr" are mostly results of applying the termcap-compiler
# code packaged with ncurses and contemplating the resulting error messages. 
# In many cases, these indicated obvious fixes to syntax garbled by the
# composers.  In a few cases, I was able to deduce corrected forms for garbled
# capabilities by looking at context.  All the information in the original
# entries is preserved in the comments.
#
# In the comments, terminfo capability names are bracketed with <> (angle
# brackets).  Termcap capability names are bracketed with :: (colons).
#
# INTERPRETATION OF USER CAPABILITIES
#
# The System V Release 4 and XPG4 terminfo format defines ten string
# capabilities for use by applications, <u0>...<u9>.   In this file, we use
# certain of these capabilities to describe functions which are not covered
# by terminfo.  The mapping is as follows:
#
#	u9	terminal enquire string (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 DA)
#	u8	terminal answerback description
#	u7	cursor position request (equiv. to VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48 DSR 6)
#	u6	cursor position report (equiv. to ANSI/ECMA-48 CPR)
#
# The terminal enquire string <u9> should elicit an answerback response
# from the terminal.  Common values for <u9> will be ^E (on older ASCII
# terminals) or \E[c (on newer VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# The cursor position request (<u7>) string should elicit a cursor position
# report.  A typical value (for VT100 terminals) is \E[6n.
#
# The terminal answerback description (u8) must consist of an expected
# answerback string.  The string may contain the following scanf(3)-like
# escapes:
#
#	%c	Accept any character
#	%[...]	Accept any number of characters in the given set
#
# The cursor position report (<u6>) string must contain two scanf(3)-style 
# %d format elements.  The first of these must correspond to the Y coordinate
# and the second to the %d.  If the string contains the sequence %i, it is
# taken as an instruction to decrement each value after reading it (this is
# the inverse sense from the cup string).  The typical CPR value is
# \E[%i%d;%dR (on VT100/ANSI/ECMA-48-compatible terminals).
#
# These capabilities are used by tac(1m), the terminfo action checker
# (distributed with ncurses 5.0).
#
# TABSET FILES
#
# All the entries in this file have been edited to assume that the tabset
# files directory is /usr/share/tabset, in conformance with the File Hierarchy
# Standard for Linux and open-source BSD systems.  Some vendors (notably Sun)
# use /usr/lib/tabset or (more recently) /usr/share/lib/tabset.  
#
# No curses package we know of actually uses these files.  If their location
# is an issue, you will have to hand-patch the file locations before compiling
# this file.
# 
# REQUEST FOR CONTACT INFORMATION AND HISTORICAL MATERIAL
#
# As the ANSI/ECMA-48 standard and variants take firmer hold, and as
# character-cell terminals are increasingly replaced by X displays, much of
# this file is becoming a historical document (this is part of the reason for
# the new organization, which puts ANSI types, xterm, Unix consoles,
# and vt100 up front in confidence that this will catch 95% of new hardware).
#
# For the terminal types still alive, I'd like to have manufacturer's
# contact data (Internet address and/or snail-mail + phone).
#
# I'm also interested in enriching the comments so that the latter portions of
# the file do in fact become a potted history of VDT technology as seen by
# UNIX hackers.  Ideally, I'd like the headers for each manufacturer to
# include its live/dead/out-of-the-business status, and for as many
# terminal types as possible to be tagged with information like years
# of heaviest use, popularity, and interesting features.
#
# I'm especially interested in identifying the obscure entries listed under
# `Miscellaneous obsolete terminals, manufacturers unknown' before the tribal
# wisdom about them gets lost.  If you know a lot about obscure old terminals,
# please go to the terminfo resource page, grab the UFO file (ufo.ti), and 
# eyeball it for things you can identify and describe. 
#
# If you have been around long enough to contribute, please read the file
# with this in mind and send me your annotations.
#
# COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER DELUSIONS
#
# The BSD ancestor of this file had a standard Regents of the University of
# California copyright with dates from 1980 to 1993.
#
# Some information has been merged in from a terminfo file SCO distributes.
# It has an obnoxious boilerplate copyright which I'm ignoring because they 
# took so much of the content from the ancestral BSD versions of this file
# and didn't attribute it, thereby violating the BSD Regents' copyright.
#
# Not that anyone should care.  However many valid functions copyrights may
# serve, putting one on a termcap/terminfo file with hundreds of anonymous
# contributors makes about as much sense as copyrighting a wall-full of
# graffiti -- it's legally dubious, ethically bogus, and patently ridiculous.
#
# This file deliberately has no copyright.  It belongs to no one and everyone.
# If you claim you own it, you will merely succeed in looking like a fool. 
# Use it as you like.  Use it at your own risk.  Copy and redistribute freely.
# There are no guarantees anywhere.  Svaha!

######## ANSI, UNIX CONSOLE, AND SPECIAL TYPES
#
# This section describes terminal classes and brands that are still
# quite common.
#

#### Specials
#
# Special "terminals".  These are used to label tty lines when you don't
# know what kind of terminal is on it.  The characteristics of an unknown
# terminal are the lowest common denominator - they look about like a ti 700.

# not to require any -- even at 9600 bps.  If you encounter problems,
# try including the padding specifications.
#
# Note: the :as: and :ae: specifications are not implemented here, for
# the available termcap documentation does not make clear WHICH alternate
# character set to specify.  ANSI 3.64 seems to make allowances for several.
# Please make the appropriate adjustments to fit your needs -- that is
# if you will be using alternate character sets.
#
# There are very few terminals running the full ANSI 3.64 standard,
# so I could only test this entry on one verified terminal (Visual 102).
# I would appreciate the results on other terminals sent to me.
#
# Please report comments, changes, and problems to:

# (For the terminfo master file, I translated these into terminfo syntax.
# Then I dropped all the pseudo-HP entries. we don't want and can't use
# the :Xs: flag. Then I split :is: into a size-independent :i1: and a
# size-dependent :is:.  Finally, I added <rmam>/<smam> -- esr)

# NOTE: :ic: has been taken out of this entry. for reference, it should
# be <ich1=\E[@>.  For discussion, see ICH/ICH1 VERSUS RMIR/SMIR below.
# (esr: added :vi: and :ve: to resolve NetBSD Problem Report #4583)

#### FreeBSD console entries
#
# From: Andrey Chernov <ache@astral.msk.su> 29 Mar 1996
# Andrey Chernov maintains the FreeBSD termcap distributions.
#
# Note: Users of FreeBSD 2.1.0 and older versions must either upgrade
# or comment out the :cb: capability in the console entry.
#
# Alexander Lukyanov reports:
# I have seen FreeBSD-2.1.5R... The old el1 bug changed, but it is still there.
# Now el1 clears not only to the line beginning, but also a large chunk
# of previous line. But there is another bug - ech does not work at all.
#

# for syscons
# common entry without semigraphics
# Bug: The <op> capability resets attributes.
# Bug? The ech and el1 attributes appear to move the cursor in some cases; for
# instance el1 does if the cursor is moved to the right margin first.  Removed
# by T.Dickey 97/5/3 (ech=\E[%p1%dX, el1=\E[1K)
#
# Setting colors turns off reverse; we cannot guarantee order, so use ncv.
# Note that this disables standout with color.

#### DEC VT100 and compatibles
#
# DEC terminals from the vt100 forward are collected here. Older DEC terminals
# and micro consoles can be found in the `obsolete' section.  More details on
# the relationship between the VT100 and ANSI X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 may be
# found near the end of this file.
#
# Except where noted, these entries are DEC's official terminfos.
# Contact Bill Hedberg <hedberg@hannah.enet.dec.com> of Terminal Support
# Engineering for more information.  Updated terminfos and termcaps 
# are kept available at ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/termcaps.
#
# In October 1995 DEC sold its terminals business, including the VT and Dorio
# line and trademark, to SunRiver Data Systems.  SunRiver has since changed
# its name to Boundless Technologies; see http://www.boundless.com.
#

# NOTE:  Any VT100 emulation, whether in hardware or software, almost
# certainly includes what DEC called the `Level 1 editing extension' codes;
# only the very oldest VT100s lacked these and there probably aren't any of
# those left alive.  To capture these, use one of the VT102 entries.
#
# Note that the :xn: glitch in vt100 is not quite the same as on the Concept,
# since the cursor is left in a different position while in the
# weird state (concept at beginning of next line, vt100 at end
# of this line) so all versions of vi before 3.7 don't handle
# :xn: right on vt100. The correct way to handle :xn: is when
# you output the char in column 80, immediately output CR LF
# and then assume you are in column 1 of the next line. If :xn:
# is on, am should be on too.
# 
# I assume you have smooth scroll off or are at a slow enough baud
# rate that it doesn't matter (1200? or less). Also this assumes
# that you set auto-nl to "on", if you set it off use vt100-nam 
# below.
# 
# The padding requirements listed here are guesses. It is strongly
# recommended that xon/xoff be enabled, as this is assumed here.
# 
# The vt100 uses <rs2> and <rf> rather than :is:/:ct:/:st: because the 
# tab settings are in non-volatile memory and don't need to be 
# reset upon login. Also setting the number of columns glitches 
# the screen annoyingly. You can type "reset" to get them set.
#
# The VT100 series terminals have cursor ("arrows") keys which can operate
# in two different modes: Cursor Mode and Application Mode.  Cursor Mode
# is the reset state, and is assumed to be the normal state.  Application
# Mode is the "set" state.  In Cursor Mode, the cursor keys transmit
# "Esc [ {code}" sequences, conforming to ANSI standards.  In Application
# Mode, the cursor keys transmit "Esc O <code>" sequences.  Application Mode
# was provided primarily as an aid to the porting of VT52 applications.  It is
# assumed that the cursor keys are normally in Cursor Mode, and expected that
# applications such as vi will always transmit the :ks: string.  Therefore,
# the definitions for the cursor keys are made to match what the terminal
# transmits after the :ks: string is transmitted.  If the :ks: string
# is a null string or is not defined, then cursor keys are assumed to be in
# "Cursor Mode", and the cursor keys definitions should match that assumption,
# else the appication may fail.  It is also expected that applications will
# always transmit the :ke: string to the terminal before they exit.
#
# The VT100 series terminals have an auxilliary keypad, commonly referred to as
# the "Numeric Keypad", because it is a cluster of numeric and function keys.
# The Numeric Keypad which can operate in two different modes: Numeric Mode and
# Application Mode.  Numeric Mode is the reset state, and is assumed to be
# the normal state.  Application Mode is the "set" state.  In Numeric Mode,
# the numeric and punctuation keys transmit ASCII 7-bit characters, and the 
# Enter key transmits the same as the Return key (Note: the Return key
# can be configured to send either LF (\015) or CR LF).  In Application Mode,
# all the keypad keys transmit "Esc O {code}" sequences.  The PF1 - PF4 keys
# always send the same "Esc O {code}" sequences.  It is assumed that the keypad
# is normally in Numeric Mode.  If an application requires that the keypad be
# in Application Mode then it is expected that the user, or the application,
# will set the TERM environment variable to point to a terminfo entry which has
# defined the :ks: string to include the codes that switch the keypad into
# Application Mode, and the terminfo entry will also define function key
# fields to match the Application Mode control codes.  If the :ks: string
# is a null string or is not defined, then the keypad is assumed to be in
# Numeric Mode.  If the :ks: string switches the keypad into Application
# Mode, it is expected that the :ke: string will contain the control codes
# necessary to reset the keypad to "Normal" mode, and it is also expected that
# applications which transmit the :ks: string will also always transmit the
# :ke: string to the terminal before they exit.
#
# Here's a diagram of the VT100 keypad keys with their bindings.
# The top line is the name of the key (some DEC keyboards have the keys
# labelled somewhat differently, like GOLD instead of PF1, but this is
# the most "official" name).  The second line is the escape sequence it
# generates in Application Keypad mode (where "$" means the ESC
# character).  The third line contains two items, first the mapping of
# the key in terminfo, and then in termcap.

# vt220 termcap written Tue Oct 25 20:41:10 1988 by Alex Latzko
# (not an official DEC entry!)
# The problem with real vt220 terminals is they don't send escapes when in
# in vt220 mode.  This can be gotten around two ways.  1> don't send
# escapes or 2> put the vt220 into vt100 mode and use all the nifty
# features of vt100 advanced video which it then has.
#
# This entry takes the view of putting a vt220 into vt100 mode so
# you can use the escape key in emacs and everything else which needs it.
#
# You probably don't want to use this on a VMS machine since VMS will think
# it has a vt220 and will get fouled up coming out of emacs
#
# From: Alexander Latzko <latzko@marsenius.rutgers.edu>, 30 Dec 1996
# (Added vt100 :rc:,:sc: to quiet a tic warning -- esr)

# These entries are not DEC's official ones, they were purpose-built for the 
# VT320.  Here are the designer's notes:
# <kel> is end on a PC kbd.  Actually 'select' on a VT.  Mapped to 
# 'Erase to End of Field'... since nothing seems to use 'end' anyways...
# khome is Home on a PC kbd.  Actually 'FIND' on a VT.
# Things that use <knxt> usually use tab anyways... and things that don't use
# tab usually use <knxt> instead...
# kprv is same as tab - Backtab is useless...
# I left out :sa: because of its RIDICULOUS complexity,
# and the resulting fact that it causes the termcap translation of the entry
# to SMASH the 1k-barrier...
# From: Adam Thompson <athompso@pangea.ca> Sept 10 1995

#   which are pretty much a superset of the VT320.  They have the
#   host writable status line, yet another different DRCS matrix size,
#   and such, but they add the DEC Technical character set, Multiple text
#   pages, selectable length pages, and the like.  The difference between
#   the vt330 and vt340 is that the latter has only 2 planes and a monochrome
#   monitor, the former has 4 planes and a color monitor.  These terminals
#   support VT131 and ANSI block mode, but as with much of these things,
#   termcap/terminfo doesn't deal with these features.
#
# Note that this entry is are set up in what was the standard way for GNU
# Emacs v18 terminal modes to deal with the cursor keys in that the arrow
# keys were switched into application mode at the same time the numeric pad
# is switched into application mode.  This changes the definitions of the
# arrow keys.  Emacs v19 is smarter and mines its keys directly out of 
# your termcap or terminfo entry,

# VT400/420 -- This terminal is a superset of the vt320.  It adds the multiple 
#    text pages and long text pages with selectable length of the vt340, along
#    with left and right margins, rectangular area text copy, fill, and erase
#    operations, selected region character attribute change operations,

#    can only take advantage of a few of these added features.

#
# DEC VT220 and up support DECUDK (user-defined keys).  DECUDK (i.e., pfx)
# takes two parameters, the key and the string.  Translating the key is
# straightforward (keys 1-5 are not defined on real terminals, though some
# emulators define these):
#
#               if (key < 16) then  value = key;
#               else if (key < 21) then value = key + 1; 
#               else if (key < 25) then value = key + 2;
#               else if (key < 27) then value = key + 3;
#               else if (key < 30) then value = key + 4;
#               else value = key + 5;
#
# The string must be the hexadecimal equivalent, e.g., "5052494E" for "PRINT". 
# There's no provision in terminfo for emitting a string in this format, so the
# application has to know it.

# VT520/VT525
#
# The VT520 is a monochrome text terminal capable of managing up to
# four independent sessions in the terminal.  It has multiple ANSI
# emulations (VT520, VT420, VT320, VT220, VT100, VT PCTerm, SCO Console)
# and ASCII emulations (WY160/60, PCTerm, 50/50+, 150/120, TVI 950,
# 925 910+, ADDS A2).  This terminfo data is for the ANSI emulations only.
#
# Terminal Set-Up is entered by pressing [F3], [Caps Lock]/[F3] or
# [Alt]/[Print Screen] depending upon which keyboard and which
# terminal mode is being used.  If Set-Up has been disabled or
# assigned to an unknown key, Set-Up may be entered by pressing
# [F3] as the first key after power up, regardless of keyboard type.
# (vt520: I added <rmam>/<smam> based on the init string, also :sc: -- esr)

# This entry is for Tera Term Pro version 2.3, for MS-Windows 95/NT written by
# T. Teranishi dated Mar 10, 1998.  It is a free software terminal emulator
# (communication program) which supports:
#
#	- Serial port connections.
#	- TCP/IP (telnet) connections.
#	- VT100 emulation, and selected VT200/300 emulation.
#	- TEK4010 emulation.
#	- File transfer protocols (Kermit, XMODEM, ZMODEM, B-PLUS and
#	  Quick-VAN).
#	- Scripts using the "Tera Term Language".
#	- Japanese and Russian character sets.
#
# The program does not come with terminfo or termcap entries.  However, the
# emulation (testing with vttest and ncurses) is reasonably close to vt100 (no
# vt52 or doublesize character support; blinking is done with color).  Besides
# the HPA, VPA extensions it also implements CPL and CNL.
#
# All of the function keys can be remapped.  This description shows the default
# mapping, as installed.  Both vt100 PF1-PF4 keys and quasi-vt220 F1-F4 keys
# are supported.  F13-F20 are obtained by shifting F3-F10.  The editing keypad
# is laid out like vt220, rather than the face codes on the PC keyboard, i.e,
#	kfnd	Insert
#	kslt	Delete
#	kich1	Home
#	kdch1	PageUp
#	kpp	End
#	knp	PageDown
#
# ANSI colors are implemented, but cannot be combined with video attributes
# except for reverse.
#
# No fonts are supplied with the program, so the acsc string is chosen to
# correspond with the default Microsoft terminal font.
#
# Tera Term recognizes some xterm sequences, including those for setting and
# retrieving the window title, and for setting the window size (i.e., using
# "resize -s"), though it does not pass SIGWINCH to the application if the
# user resizes the window with the mouse.

#### X terminal emulators
#
# You can add the following line to your .Xdefaults to change the terminal type
# set by the xterms you start up to my-xterm:
#
# *termName:  my-xterm
#
# System administrators can change the default entry for xterm instances
# by adding a similar line to /usr/X11/lib/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.  In either
# case, xterm will detect and reject an invalid terminal type, falling back
# to the default of xterm.

# Notes:
# rxvt 2.21b uses
#	smacs=\E(B\E)U^N, rmacs=\E(B\E)0^O,
# but some applications don't work with that.
# It also has an AIX extension
#	box2=lqkxjmwuvtn,
# and
#	ech=\E[%p1%dX,
# but the latter does not work correctly.
#
# The distributed terminfo says it implements hpa and vpa, but they are not
# implemented correctly, using relative rather than absolute positioning.
#
# rxvt is normally configured to look for "xterm" or "xterm-color" as $TERM.
# Since rxvt is not really compatible with xterm, it should be configured as
# "rxvt" (monochrome) and "rxvt-color".

# From: Benjamin C. W. Sittler <bsittler@nmt.edu>
#
# I have a UNIX PC which I use as a terminal attached to my Linux PC.
# Unfortunately, the UNIX PC terminfo entry that comes with ncurses
# is broken. All the special key sequences are broken, making it unusable
# with Emacs. The problem stems from the following:
# 
# The UNIX PC has a plethora of keys (103 of them, and there's no numeric
# keypad!), loadable fonts, and strange highlighting modes ("dithered"
# half-intensity, "smeared" bold, and real strike-out, for example.) It also
# uses resizable terminal windows, but the bundled terminal program always
# uses an 80x24 window (and doesn't support seem to support a 132-column
# mode.) 
# 
# HISTORY: The UNIX PC was one of the first machines with a GUI, and used a
# library which was a superset of SVr3.5 curses (called tam, for "terminal
# access method".) tam includes support for real, overlapping windows,
# onscreen function key labels, and bitmap graphics. But since the primary
# user interface on the UNIX PC was a GUI program (ua, for "user
# assistant",) and remote administration was considered important for the
# machine, tam also supported VT100-compatible terminals attached to the
# serial port or used across the StarLan network. To simulate the extra keys
# not present on a VT100, users could press ESC and a two-letter sequence,
# such as u d (Undo) or U D (Shift-Undo.) These two-letter sequences,
# however, were not the same as those sent by the actual Undo key. The
# actual Undo key sends ESC 0 s unshifted, and ESC 0 S shifted, for example.
# (If you're interested in adding some of the tam calls to ncurses, btw, I
# have the full documentation and several programs which use tam. It also
# used an extended terminfo format to describe key sequences, special
# highlighting modes, etc.) 
# 
# KEYS: This means that ncurses would quite painful on the UNIX PC, since
# there are two sequences for every key-modifier combination (local keyboard
# sequence and remote "VT100" sequence.) But I doubt many people are trying
# to use ncurses on the UNIX PC, since ncurses doesn't properly handle the
# GUI. Unfortunately, the terminfo entry (and the termcap, too, I presume) 
# seem to have been built from the manual describing the VT100 sequences. 
# This means it doesn't work for a real live UNIX PC. 
# 
# FONTS: The UNIX PC also has a strange interpretation of "alternate
# character set". Rather than the VT100 graphics you might expect, it allows
# up to 8 custom fonts to be loaded at any given time. This means that
# programs expecting VT100 graphics will usually be disappointed. For this
# reason I have disabled the smacs/rmacs sequences, but they could easily be
# re-enabled. Here are the relevant control sequences (from the ESCAPE(7) 
# manpage), should you wish to do so: 
# 
# SGR10 - Select font 0 - ESC [ 10 m or SO
# SGR11 - Select font 1 - ESC [ 11 m or SI
# SGR12 - Select font 2 - ESC [ 12 m
# ... (etc.)
# SGR17 - Select font 7 - ESC [ 17 m
# 
# Graphics for line drawing are not reliably found at *any* character
# location because the UNIX PC has dynamically reloadable fonts. I use font
# 0 for regular text and font 1 for italics, but this is by no means
# universal. So ASCII line drawing is in order if smacs/rmacs are enabled.
# 
# MISC: The cursor visible/cursor invisible sequences were swapped in the
# distributed terminfo.
# 
# To ameliorate these problems (and fix a few highlighting bugs) I rewrote
# the UNIX PC terminfo entry. The modified version works great with Lynx,
# Emacs, and XEmacs running on my Linux PC and displaying on the UNIX PC
# attached by serial cable. In Emacs, even the Undo key works, and many
# applications can now use the F1-F8 keys. 
# 
# esr's notes:
#	Terminfo entry for the AT&T Unix PC 7300
#	from escape(7) in Unix PC 7300 Manual.
#	Somewhat similar to a vt100-am (but different enough

#### Iris consoles
#

# Sent by Stefan Stapelberg <stefan@rent-a-guru.de>, 24 Feb 1997, this is
# from SGI's terminfo database.  SGI's entry shows F9-F12 with the codes
# for the application keypad mode.  We have added iris-ansi-ap rather than
# change the original to keypad mode.
#
# (iris-ansi: added rmam/smam based on init string -- esr)
#
# This entry, and those derived from it, is used in xwsh (also known as
# winterm).  Some capabilities that do not fit into the terminfo model
# include the shift- and control-functionkeys:
#
# F1-F12 generate different codes when shift or control modifiers are used.
# For example:
#	F1      	\E[001q
#	shift F1	\E[013q
#	control-F1	\E[025q
#
# In application keypad mode, F9-F12 generate codes like vt100 PF1-PF4, i.e.,
# \EOP to \EOS.  The shifted and control modifiers still do the same thing.
#
# The cursor keys also have different codes:
#	control-up	\E[162q
#	control-down	\E[165q
#	control-left	\E[159q
#	control-right	\E[168q
#
#	shift-up	\E[161q

# Francesco Potorti <F.Potorti@cnuce.cnr.it>:
# NCSA telnet is one of the most used telnet clients for the Macintosh.  It has
# been maintained until recently by the National Center for Supercomputer
# Applications, and it is feature rich, stable and free.  It can be downloaded
# from www.ncsa.edu.  This terminfo description file is based on xterm-vt220,
# xterm+sl, and the docs at NCSA.  It works well.
#
# NCSA Telnet 2.6 for Macintosh in vt220 8-bit emulation mode
# The terminal options should be set as follows:
#         Xterm sequences ON
#         use VT wrap mode ON
#         use Emacs arrow keys OFF
#         CTRL-COMND is Emacs meta ON
#         8 bit mode ON
#         answerback string: "ncsa-vt220-8"
#         setup keys: all disabled
#
# Application mode is not used.
#
# Other special mappings:
#	Apple		VT220
#	HELP 		Find
#	HOME		Insert here
#	PAGEUP		Remove
#	DEL		Select
#	END		Prev Screen
#	PAGEDOWN	Next Screen
#
# Though it supports ANSI color, NCSA Telnet uses color to represent blinking
# text.
#
# The status-line manipulation is a mapping of the xterm-compatible control
# sequences for setting the window-title.  So you must use tsl and fsl in
# pairs, since the latter ends the string that is loaded to the window-title.

# QNX 4.0 Console
# Michael's original version of this entry had <am@>, :ti=\Ei:,
# :te=\Eh\ER:; this was so terminfo applications could write the lower

#### DOS ANSI.SYS variants
#
# This completely describes the sequences specified in the DOS 2.1 ANSI.SYS
# documentation (except for the keyboard key reassignment feature, which
# doen't fit the <pfkey> model well).  The klone+acs sequences were valid
# though undocumented.  The <pfkey> capability is untested but should work for
# keys F1-F10 (%p1 values outside this range will yield unpredictable results).

#
# Define IBM PC keypad keys for vi as per MS-Kermit while using ANSI.SYS.
# This should only be used when the terminal emulator cannot redefine the keys.
# Since redefining keys with ansi.sys also affects PC-DOS programs, the key
# definitions must be restored.  If the terminal emulator is quit while in vi
# or others using :ks:/:ke:, the keypad will not be defined as per PC-DOS.
# The PgUp and PgDn are prefixed with ESC so that tn3270 can be used on Unix
# (^U and ^D are already defined for tn3270).  The ESC is safe for vi but it
# does "beep".  ESC ESC i is used for Ins to avoid tn3270 ESC i for coltab.
# Note that :kl: is always BS, because PC-dos can tolerate this change.
# Caution: vi is limited to 256 string bytes, longer crashes or weirds out vi.
# Consequently the End keypad key could not be set (it is relatively safe and
# actually useful because it sends ^@ O, which beeps and opens a line above).

#### Windows NT
#
# This entry fits the Windows NT console when the _POSIX_TERM environment
# variable is set to 'on'.  While the Windows NT POSIX console is seldom used,
# the Telnet client supplied with both the Windows for WorkGroup 3.11 TCP/IP
# stack and the Win32 (i.e., Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.1 or later) operating
# systems is not, and (surprise!) they match very well.
#
# See:  MS Knowledge Base item Q108581, dated 13-MAY-1997, titled "Setting Up
# VI POSIX Editor for Windows NT 3.1".  True to Microsoft form, not only
# are the installation instructions a pile of mind-numbing bureaucratese,
# but the termcap entry is actually broken and unusable as given; the :do:
# capability is misspelled "d".
#
# To use this, you need to a bunch of environment variables: 
#
# SET _POSIX_TERM=on
# SET TERM=ansi
# SET TERMCAP=location of termcap file in POSIX file format
# which is case-sensitive.
# e.g. SET TERMCAP=//D/RESKIT35/posix/termcap
# SET TMP=//C/TEMP
#
# Important note: setting the TMP environment variable in POSIX style renders
# it incompatible with a lot of other applications, including Visual C++. So
# you should have a separate command window just for vi. All the other
# variables may be permanently set in the Control Panel\System applet. 
#
# You can find out more about the restrictions of this facility at
# <http://www.nentug.org/unix-to-nt/ntposix.htm>.

######## COMMON TERMINAL TYPES
#
# This section describes terminal classes and maker brands that are still
# quite common, but have proprietary command sets not blessed by ANSI.
#

#### Lear-Siegler (adm)
#
# These guys are long since out of the terminals business, but
# in 1995 many current terminals still have an adm type as one of their
# emulations (usually their stupidest, and usually labeled adm3, though
# these `adm3' emulations normally have adm3a+ capabilities).
#
# WARNING: Some early ADM terminals (including the ADM3 and ADM5) had a 
# `diagnostic feature' that sending them a ^G while pin 22 (`Ring Indicator')
# was being held to ground would trigger a send of the top line on the screen.
# A quick fix might be to drop back to a cheesy 4-wire cable with pin 22
# hanging in the air. (Thanks to Eric Fischer, <eric@fudge.uchicago.edu>,
# for clearing up this point.)

# Ctrl-U User friendly mode (normal setup)

# ADM-12+ supports hardware handshaking, but it is DTR/CTS as opposed to
# RTS/CTS used nowadays with virtually every modem and computer. 19200
# bps works fine with hardware flow control.
# 
# The following null-modem cable should fix this and enable you to use
# RTS/CTS handshaking (which Linux supports, use CRTSCTS setting). Also
# set ADM-12+ for DTR handshaking from supervisor setup.

#
# Qume was bought by Wyse, but still (as of early 1995) has its own support
# group and production division.
#
# Discontinued Qume models:
#
# The qvt101 and qvt102 listed here are long obsolete; so is the qvt101+
# built to replace them, and a qvt119+ which was a 101+ with available wide
# mode (132 columns).  There was a qvt103 which added vt100/vt131 emulations
# and an ANSI-compatible qvt203 that replaced it.  Qume started producing
# ANSI-compatible terminals with the qvt323 and qvt61.
#
# Current Qume models (as of February 1995):
#
# All current Qume terminals have ANSI-compatible operation modes.
# Qume is still producing the qvt62, which features emulations for other
# popular lines such as ADDS, and dual-host capabilities.  The qvt82 is
# designed for use as a SCO ANSI terminal.  The qvt70 is a color terminal
# with many emulations including Wyse370, Wyse 325, etc.  Their newest
# model is the qvt520, which is vt420-compatible.
#
# There are some ancient printing Qume terminals under `Daisy Wheel Printers'
#
# If you inherit a Qume without docs, try Ctrl-Shift-Setup to enter its
# setup mode.  Shift-s should be a configuration save to NVRAM.

# There are some tvi terminals that require incredible amounts of padding and
# some that don't.  I'm assuming tvi912 and tvi920 are the old slow ones, and
# tvi912b, tvi912c, tvi920b, tvi920c are the new ones that don't need padding.
#
# All of these terminals (912 to 970 and the tvipt) are discontinued.  Newer
# Televideo terminals are ANSI and PC-ANSI compatible.

# (tvi955: removed obsolete ":ma:=^Vj^Kk^Hh^Ll^^H";
# removed incorrect (and overridden) ":do=^J:"; fixed broken continuations in
# the :rs: string, inserted the :IC: implied by the termcap :ko: string.  Note
# the :ko: string had :cl: in it, which means that one of the original
# :cl=\E*:, <kclr=\EY> had to be wrong; set <kclr=\E*> because that's what
# the 950 has.   Finally, corrected the <kel> string to match the 950 and what
# ko implies -- esr)
# If the BSD termcap file was right, :cm=\E=%p1%{32}%+%c%p2%{32}%+%c: would

# Visual 50 from Beau Shekita, BTL-Whippany <whuxlb!ejs>
# Recently I hacked together the following termcap for Visual
# Technology's Visual 50 terminal. It's a slight modification of
# the vt52 termcap. 
# It's intended to run when the Visual 50 is in vt52 emulation mode
# (I know what you're thinking; if it's emulating a vt52, then why
# another termcap? Well, it turns out that the Visual 50 can handle
# :dl: and db(?) among other things, which the vt52 can't)
# The termcap works OK for the most part. The only problem is on
# character inserts. The whole line gets painfully redrawn for each
# character typed. Any suggestions?
# Beau's entry is combined with the vi50 entry from University of Wisconsin.
# Note especially the :al: function.  :k4:-:k6: are really l4-l6 in
# disguise; :k7:-:k9: are really l1-l3.

#	Vox: (408)-473-1200
#	Fax: (408) 473-1222
#	Web: http://www.wyse.com
#
# Wyse sales can be reached by phone at 1-800-GET-WYSE.  Tech support is at
# (800)-800-WYSE (option 5 gets you a human).  There's a Web page at the
# obvious address, <http://www.wyse.com>.  They keep terminfo entries at
# <http://www.wyse.co.uk/support/appnotes/idxappnt.htm>.
#
# Wyse bought out Link Technology, Inc. in 1990 and closed it down in 1995.
# They now own the Qume and Amdek brands, too.  So these are the people to
# talk with about all Link, Qume, and Amdek terminals.
#
# These entries include a few small fixes.
# I canceled the bel capacities in the vb entries.
# I made two trivial syntax fixes in the wyse30 entry.
# I made some entries relative to adm+sgr.
#
#
# Note: The wyse75, wyse85, and wyse99 have been discontinued.

#	   Although the Wyse 30 can support more than one attribute
#	it requires magic cookies to do so.  Many applications do not
#	function well with magic cookies.  The following terminfo uses
#	the protect mode to support one attribute (dim) without cookies.
#	If more than one attribute is needed then the wy30-mc terminfo
#	should be used.

#	mix color with reverse, dim or underline.
#	    To further complicate things one of the attributes must be
#	black (either the foreground or the background).  In reverse video
#	the background changes color with black letters.  In normal video
#	the foreground changes colors on a black background.  
#	    This terminfo uses some of the more advanced features of curses
#	to display both color and blink.  In the final analysis I am not
#	sure that the wy350 runs better with this terminfo than it does
#	with the wy50 terminfo (with user adjusted colors).
#
#	The mandatory pause used by flash does not work with
#	older versions of terminfo.  If you see this effect then
#	unset xon and delete the / from the delay.
#	i.e. change $<100/> to $<100>
#
# Bug: The <op> capability resets attributes.

#
#	The Wyse 60 is like the Wyse 50 but with more padding.
#	The reset strings are slow and the pad times very depending
#	on other parameters such as font loading.  I have tried
#	to follow the following outline:
#
#		<rs1> -> set personality
#		<rs2> -> set number of columns
#		<rs3> -> set number of lines
#		:i1: -> select the proper font
#		:is: -> do the initialization
#		:i3: -> set up display memory (2 pages)
#
#	The Wyse 60's that have vt100 emulation are slower than the
#	older Wyse 60's.  This change happened mid-1987.
#	The capabilities effected are :dc: :dl: :al: :sf: :sr:
#
#	The meta key is only half right.  This terminal will return the
#	high order bit set when you hit CTRL-function_key
#
#	It may be useful to assign two function keys with the
#	values  \E=(\s  look at old data in page 1
#	        \E=W,   look at bottom of page 1
#	where \s is a space ( ).
#
#	Note:
#	   The Wyse 60 runs faster when the XON/XOFF
#	   handshake is turned off.
#
# (wy60: we use \E{ rather than ^^ for home (both are documented) to avoid
# a bug reported by Robert Dunn, <rcdii@inlink.com> -- esr)

#	The Wyse-99GT looks at lot like the Wyse 60 except that it
#	does not have the 42/43 line mode.  In the Wyse-60 the "lines"
#	setup parameter controls the number of lines on the screen.
#	For the Wyse 99GT the "lines" setup parameter controls the
#	number of lines in a page.  The screen can display 25 lines max.
#	    The Wyse-99GT also has personalities for the VT220 and
#	Tektronix 4014.  But this has no bearing on the native mode.
#
#	(msgr) should be set but the clear screen fails when in
#	alt-charset mode.  Try \EcE\s\s\E+\s if the screen is really clear
#	then set msgr, else use msgr@.
#
#	u0 -> enter Tektronix mode
#	u1 -> exit Tektronix mode

#
#	The Wyse 160 is combination of the WY-60 and the WY-99gt.
#	The reset strings are slow and the pad times very depending
#	on other parameters such as font loading.  I have tried
#	to follow the following outline:
#
#		<rs1> -> set personality
#		<rs2> -> set number of columns
#		<rs3> -> set number of lines
#		:i1: -> select the proper font
#		:is: -> do the initialization
#		:i3: -> set up display memory (2 pages)
#
#	The display memory may be used for either text or graphics.
#	When "Display Memory = Shared" the terminal will have more pages
#	but garbage may be left on the screen when you switch from
#	graphics to text.  If "Display Memory = Unshared" then the
#	text area will be only one page long.
#
# (wy160: we use \E{ rather than ^^ for home (both are documented) to avoid
# a bug reported by Robert Dunn, <rcdii@inlink.com> -- esr)

#	The Wyse 75 is a vt100 lookalike without advanced video.
#
#	   The Wyse 75 can support one attribute (e.g. Dim, Inverse,
#	Underline) without magic cookies.  The following description
#	uses this capability, but when more than one attribute is
#	put on the screen at once, all attributes will be changed
#	to be the same as the last attribute given.
#	   The Wyse 75 can support more attributes when used with magic
#	cookies.  The wy75-mc terminal description uses magic cookies
#	to correctly handle multiple attributes on a screen.

#	Wyse 85 emulating a vt220 7 bit mode.
#		24 line screen with status line.
#
#	The vt220 mode permits more function keys but it wipes out
#	the escape key.  I strongly recommend that <f11> be set to
#	escape (esc).
#	The terminal may have to be set for 8 data bits and 2 stop
#	bits for the arrow keys to work.
#	The Wyse 85 runs faster with XON/XOFF enabled.  Also the
#	:DC: and :IC: work best when XON/XOFF is set.  :IC: and
#	:DC: leave trash on the screen when used without XON/XOFF.

# Vendor-supplied Wyse entries end here.

# Can't set tabs! Other bugs (ANSI mode only):
# - can't redefine function keys (anyway, key redefinition in ANSI mode
#   is too much complex to be described);
# - meta key can't be described (the terminal forgets it when reset);
# The xon-xoff handshaking can't be disabled while in ansi personality, so
# emacs can't work at speed greater than 9600 baud.  No padding is needed at
# this speed.
#   dch1 has been commented out because it causes annoying glittering when
# vi deletes one character at the beginning of a line with tabs in it.
#   dch makes sysgen(1M) have a horrible behaviour when deleting
# a screen and makes screen(1) behave badly, so it is disabled too. The nice
# thing is that vi goes crazy if smir-rmir are present and both dch-dch1 are
# not, so smir and rmir are commented out as well.

# This terminal (firmware version 02) has a lot of bugs:
# - can't set tabs;
# - other bugs in ANSI modes (see above).
# This description disables handshaking when using cup. This is because
# GNU emacs doesn't like Xon-Xoff handshaking. This means the terminal
# cannot be used at speeds greater than 9600 baud, because at greater
# speeds handshaking is needed even for character sending. If you use
# DTR handshaking, you can use even greater speeds.

#TITLE:  TERMINFO ENTRY WY520
#DATE:   8/5/93
# The WY520 terminfo is based on the WY285 entry published on the WYSE 
# BBS with the addition of more function keys and special keys.
#
#               rs1 -> set personality
#               rs2 -> set number of columns
#               rs3 -> set number of lines
#               is1 -> select the proper font
#               is2 -> do the initialization
#               is3 -> If this string is empty then rs3 gets sent.
#
#       Wyse 520 emulating a vt420 7 bit mode with default ANSI keyboard
#       - The BS key is programmed to generate BS in smcup since
#         is2 doesn't seem to work.
#       - Remove and shift/Remove: delete a character
#       - Insert : enter insert mode
#       - Find   : delete to end of file
#       - Select : clear a line
#       - F11, F12, F13: send default sequences (not ESC, BS, LF)
#       - F14 : Home key
#       - Bottom status line (host writable line) is used.
#       - smkx,rmkx are removed because this would put the numeric
#         keypad in Dec application mode which doesn't seem to work
#         with SCO applications.

# From: Kevin Turner <kevint@aracnet.com>, 12 Jul 1998
# This copes with an apparent firmware bug in the wy85.  He writes:
# "What I did was change leave the terminal cursor keys set to Normal
# (instead of application), and change \E[ to \233 for all the keys in
# terminfo. At one point, I found some reference indicating that this
# terminal bug (not sending \E[) was acknowledged by Wyse (so it's not just
# me), but I can't find that and the server under my bookmark to "Wyse 
# Technical" isn't responding.  So there's the question of wether the wy85
# terminfo should reflect the manufactuer's intended behaviour of the terminal
# or the actual."

######## ---------------- TERMINFO FILE CAN BE SPLIT HERE -------------------
# This cut mark helps make life less painful for people running ncurses tic
# on machines with relatively little RAM.  The file can be broken in half here
# cleanly and compiled in sections -- no `use' references cross this cut
# going forward.
#

######## OLDER TERMINAL TYPES
#
# This section is devoted to older commercial terminal brands that are now
# discontinued, but known to be still in use or represented by emulations.
#

#### AT&T (att, tty)
#
# This section also includes Teletype-branded VDTs.
#
# The AT&T/Teletype terminals group was sold to SunRiver Data Systems (now
# Boundless Technologies); for details, see the header comment on the ADDS
# section.
#
# These are AT&T's official terminfo entries.  All-caps aliases have been
# removed.
