SDL_eventmap

SDL_eventmap is a uniform event-mapping library for Simple Directmedia Layer. 
Keyboard, joystick, and mouse events are programmably mapped to virtual events. 
This library allows SDL programs to easily reprogram their inputs for joystick,
mouse, keyboard, etc. It also simplifies programming by helping organize these 
diverse forms of input into these uniform virtual events.
