 makes
small adjustments to the system time, as returned by  advancing or retarding
it by the time specified by the timeval  If  is negative, the clock is
slowed down by incrementing it more slowly than normal until the correction
is complete. If  is positive, a larger increment than normal is used. The
skew used to perform the correction is generally a fraction of one percent.
Thus, the time is always a monotonically increasing function. A time correction
from an earlier call to  may not be finished when  is called again. If 
is non-nil, the structure pointed to will contain, upon return, the number
of microseconds still to be corrected from the earlier call.  This call
may be used by time servers that synchronize the clocks of computers in
a local area network. Such time servers would slow down the clocks of some
machines and speed up the clocks of others to bring them to the average
network time.  The call   is restricted to the super-user. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
A
return value of 0 indicates that the call succeeded. A return value of -1
indicates that an error occurred, and in this case an error code is stored
in the global variable

 will fail if:   An argument points outside
the process&rsquo;s allocated address space.  The process&rsquo;s effective user ID is
not that of the super-user.
