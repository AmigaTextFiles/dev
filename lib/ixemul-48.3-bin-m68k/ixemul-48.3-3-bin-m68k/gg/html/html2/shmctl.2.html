The  system
call performs some control operations on the shared memory area specified
by  
<p> Each shared memory segment has a data structure associated with it,
parts of which may be altered by  and parts of which determine the actions
of  
<p> This structure is defined as follows in   struct shmid_ds {     struct
ipc_perm shm_perm;     /* operation permissions */<br>
     int             shm_segsz;    /* size of segment in bytes */<br>
     pid_t           shm_lpid;     /* pid of last shm op */<br>
     pid_t           shm_cpid;     /* pid of creator */<br>
     short           shm_nattch;   /* # of current attaches */<br>
     time_t          shm_atime;    /* last shmat() time*/<br>
     time_t          shm_dtime;    /* last shmdt() time */<br>
     time_t          shm_ctime;    /* last change by shmctl() */<br>
     void           *shm_internal; /* sysv stupidity */<br>
 };  The  ipc_perm  structure used inside the  shmid_ds  structure is defined
in  and looks like this:  struct ipc_perm {     ushort cuid; /* creator
user id */<br>
     ushort cgid; /* creator group id */<br>
     ushort uid;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp; /* user id */<br>
     ushort gid;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp; /* group id */<br>
     ushort mode; /* r/w permission (see <a href='chmod.2'>chmod(2)</a>
) */<br>
     ushort seq;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp; /* sequence # (to generate unique msg/sem/shm id) */<br>
     key_t key;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp; /* user specified msg/sem/shm key */<br>
 };  
<p> The operation to be performed by  is specified in  and is one of:

the structure pointed to by  This operation can only be executed by the
super-user, or a process that has an effective user id equal to either 
 or  in the data structure associated with the shared memory segment. 
<p> 
Remove the shared memory segment specified by  and destroy the data associated
with it. Only the super-user or a process with an effective uid equal to
the   or  values in the data structure associated with the queue can do
this.  
<p> The read and write permissions on a shared memory identifier are
determined by the  field in the same way as is done with files (see  but
the effective uid can match either the  field or the  field, and the effective
gid can match either  or

Upon successful completion, a value
of 0 is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global variable  is set
to indicate the error.

<p> An attempt is made to increase the value of  through IPC_SET but
the caller is not the super-user.  The command is IPC_STAT and the caller
has no read permission for this shared memory segment.   is not a valid
