<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
The system defines a set of signals that may be delivered
to a process. Signal delivery resembles the occurrence of a hardware interrupt:
the signal is blocked from further occurrence, the current process  context
is saved, and a new one is built.  A process may specify a  to which a signal
is delivered, or specify that a signal is to be   A process may also specify
that a default action is to be taken by the system when a signal occurs.
A signal may also be  in which case its delivery is postponed until it
is  The action to be taken on delivery is determined at the time of delivery.
Normally, signal handlers execute on the current stack of the process. 
This may be changed, on a per-handler basis, so that signals are taken on
a special   Signal routines execute with the signal that caused their invocation
 but other signals may yet occur. A global   defines the set of signals
currently blocked from delivery to a process.  The signal mask for a process
is initialized from that of its parent (normally empty).  It may be changed
with a  call, or when a signal is delivered to the process.  When a signal
condition arises for a process, the signal is added to a set of signals
pending for the process. If the signal is not currently  by the process
then it is delivered to the process. Signals may be delivered any time a
process enters the operating system (e.g., during a system call, page fault
or trap, or clock interrupt). If multiple signals are ready to be delivered
at the same time, any signals that could be caused by traps are delivered
first. Additional signals may be processed at the same time, with each appearing
to interrupt the handlers for the previous signals before their first instructions.
The set of pending signals is returned by the  function. When a caught signal
is delivered, the current state of the process is saved, a new signal mask
is calculated (as described below),  and the signal handler is invoked.
 The call to the handler is arranged so that if the signal handling routine
returns normally the process will resume execution in the context from
before the signal&rsquo;s delivery. If the process wishes to resume in a different
context, then it must arrange to restore the previous context itself.  When
a signal is delivered to a process a new signal mask is installed for the
duration of the process&rsquo; signal handler (or until a  call is made). This
mask is formed by taking the union of the current signal mask set, the
signal to be delivered, and  the signal mask associated with the handler
to be invoked.   assigns an action for a specific signal. If  is non-zero,
it specifies an action   or a handler routine) and mask to be used when
delivering the specified signal. If   is non-zero, the previous handling
information for the signal is returned to the user.  Once a signal handler
is installed, it remains installed until another  call is made, or an 
 is performed. A signal-specific default action may be reset by setting 
to  The defaults are process termination, possibly with core dump; no action;
stopping the process; or continuing the process. See the signal list below
for each signal&rsquo;s default action. If  is  the default action for the signal
is to discard the signal, and if a signal is pending, the pending signal
is discarded even if the signal is masked. If  is set to  current and pending
