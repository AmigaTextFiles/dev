be used to create new processes without fully copying the address space
of the old process, which is horrendously inefficient in a paged environment.
 It is useful when the purpose of  would have been to create a new system
context for an   differs from  in that the child borrows the parent&rsquo;s memory
and thread of control until a call to  or an exit (either by a call to
 or abnormally.) The parent process is suspended while the child is using
its resources.   returns 0 in the child&rsquo;s context and (later) the pid of
the child in the parent&rsquo;s context.   can normally be used just like  It does
not work, however, to return while running in the childs context from the
procedure that called  since the eventual return from  would then return
to a no longer existent stack frame. Be careful, also, to call  rather than
 if you can&rsquo;t  since  will flush and close standard I/O channels, and thereby
mess up the parent processes standard I/O data structures. (Even with  it
is wrong to call  since buffered data would then be flushed twice.)

This system call will be eliminated
when proper system sharing mechanisms are implemented.  Users should not
depend on the memory sharing semantics of  as it will, in that case, be
made synonymous to   To avoid a possible deadlock situation, processes
that are children in the middle of a  are never sent  or  signals; rather,
output or  calls are allowed and input attempts result in an end-of-file
indication.
