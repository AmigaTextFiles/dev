attempts to read  of data from the object referenced by the descriptor

the input data into the   buffers specified by the members of the  array:
iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt-1].  For   the   structure is defined as:  
struct iovec { <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;void *iov_base;<br>
 <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;size_t iov_len;<br>
 };   Each   entry specifies the base address and length of an area in
memory where data should be placed.   will always fill an area completely
before proceeding to the next.  On objects capable of seeking, the  starts

 the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes actually read.  Objects
that are not capable of seeking always read from the current position. 
The value of the pointer associated with such an object is undefined.  Upon
successful completion,  and  return the number of bytes actually read and
placed in the buffer. The system guarantees to read the number of bytes
requested if the descriptor references a normal file that has that many
bytes left before the end-of-file, but in no other case.  
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
If
successful, the number of bytes actually read is returned. Upon reading
end-of-file, zero is returned. Otherwise, a -1 is returned and the global variable
 is set to indicate the error.

a valid file or socket descriptor open for reading.   points outside the
allocated address space.  An I/O error occurred while reading from the file
system.  A read from a slow device was interrupted before any data arrived
by the delivery of a signal.  The pointer associated with  was negative.
 The file was marked for non-blocking I/O, and no data were ready to be
read.   In addition,   may return one of the following errors:    was less
