 causes
the file named by  or referenced by  to be truncated to at most  bytes
in size.  If the file previously was larger than this size, the extra data
is lost. With  the file must be open for writing. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
A value of
0 is returned if the call succeeds.  If the call fails a -1 is returned,
and the global variable  specifies the error. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
 succeeds unless:  
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.  A component of a pathname
exceeded   characters, or an entire path name exceeded   characters.  The
named file does not exist.  Search permission is denied for a component
of the path prefix.  The named file is not writable by the user.  Too many
symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.  The named
file is a directory.  The named file resides on a read-only file system. 
The file is a pure procedure (shared text) file that is being executed.
 An I/O error occurred updating the inode.   points outside the process&rsquo;s
allocated address space.    succeeds unless:   The  is not a valid descriptor.
 The  references a socket, not a file.  The  is not open for writing.

These calls should be generalized to allow ranges of bytes in
a file to be discarded.
