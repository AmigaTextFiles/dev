The
owner ID and group ID of the file named by  or referenced by  is changed
as specified by the arguments  and   The owner of a file may change the
 to a group of which he or she is a member, but the change  capability
is restricted to the super-user.   clears the set-user-id and set-group-id bits
on the file to prevent accidental or mischievous creation of set-user-id

be left unchanged by specifying it as -1.

symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.  The effective
user ID is not the super-user.  The named file resides on a read-only file
system.   points outside the process&rsquo;s allocated address space.  An I/O error
occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.    will fail
if:    does not refer to a valid descriptor.   refers to a socket, not a
file.  The effective user ID is not the super-user.  The named file resides
on a read-only file system.  An I/O error occurred while reading from or
