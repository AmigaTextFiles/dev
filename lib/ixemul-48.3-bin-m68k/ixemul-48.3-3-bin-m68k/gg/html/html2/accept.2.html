The

connection request on the queue of pending connections, creates a new socket

is not marked as non-blocking,  blocks the caller until a connection is
present. If the socket is marked non-blocking and no pending connections
are present on the queue,   returns an error as described below. The accepted
socket may not be used to accept more connections.  The original socket
 remains open.  The argument  is a result parameter that is filled in with
the address of the connecting entity, as known to the communications layer.
The exact format of the  parameter is determined by the domain in which
the communication is occurring. The   is a value-result parameter; it should

 can be thought of as merely dequeuing the next connection request and
not implying confirmation. Confirmation can be implied by a normal read
or write on the new file descriptor, and rejection can be implied by closing
the new socket.  One can obtain user connection request data without confirming
the connection by issuing a   call with an  of 0 and a non-zero  or by issuing
a  request. Similarly, one can provide user connection rejection information
by issuing a  call with providing only the control information, or by calling

The call returns -1 on error.  If it succeeds, it returns a
non-negative integer that is a descriptor for the accepted socket.
