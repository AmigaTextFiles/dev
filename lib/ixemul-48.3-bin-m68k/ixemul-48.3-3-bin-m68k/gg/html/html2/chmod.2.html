The

that the process owner (user) either owns the file specified by  (or  or
is the super-user. A mode is created from  permission bit masks defined in

are shareable (the default) and the system maintains the program text of
the files in the swap area. The sticky bit may only be set by the super
user on shareable executable files.  If mode  (the &lsquo;sticky bit&rsquo;) is set on
a directory, an unprivileged user may not delete or rename files of other
users in that directory. The sticky bit may be set by any user on a directory
which the user owns or has appropriate permissions. For more details of
the properties of the sticky bit, see   Writing or changing the owner of
a file turns off the set-user-id and set-group-id bits unless the user is the
super-user. This makes the system somewhat more secure by protecting set-user-id
(set-group-id) files from remaining set-user-id (set-group-id) if they are modified,
at the expense of a degree of compatibility.

Upon successful
completion, a value of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned
and  is set to indicate the error.

 will fail and the file mode will
be unchanged if:   A component of the path prefix is not a directory.  A
component of a pathname exceeded   characters, or an entire path name exceeded
  characters.  The named file does not exist.  Search permission is denied
for a component of the path prefix.  Too many symbolic links were encountered
in translating the pathname.  The effective user ID does not match the owner
of the file and the effective user ID is not the super-user.  The named file
resides on a read-only file system.   points outside the process&rsquo;s allocated
address space.  An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
file system.    will fail if:   The descriptor is not valid.   refers to
a socket, not to a file.  The file resides on a read-only file system.  An
I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.
