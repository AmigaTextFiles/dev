and  manipulate the  associated with a socket.  Options may exist at multiple
protocol levels; they are always present at the uppermost  level.  When
manipulating socket options the level at which the option resides and the
name of the option must be specified. To manipulate options at the socket
level,  is specified as  To manipulate options at any other level the protocol

options are passed uninterpreted to the appropriate protocol module for
interpretation. The include file  contains definitions for socket level
options, described below. Options at other protocol levels vary in format
and name; consult the appropriate entries in section 4 of the manual.  Most
socket-level options utilize an  parameter for  For  the parameter should

of a program to each receive UDP/IP multicast or broadcast datagrams destined
for the bound port.  enables the periodic transmission of messages on a
connected socket.  Should the connected party fail to respond to these messages,
the connection is considered broken and processes using the socket are
notified via a  signal when attempting to send data.  indicates that outgoing
messages should bypass the standard routing facilities.  Instead, messages
are directed to the appropriate network interface according to the network
portion of the destination address.   controls the action taken when unsent
messages are queued on socket and a   is performed. If the socket promises
reliable delivery of data and  the system will block the process on the
  attempt until it is able to transmit the data or until it decides it
is unable to deliver the information (a timeout period, termed the linger
interval, is specified in the  call when  is requested).  If  is disabled
and a   is issued, the system will process the close in a manner that allows
the process to continue as quickly as possible.  The option  requests permission
to send broadcast datagrams on the socket. Broadcast was a privileged operation
in earlier versions of the system. With protocols that support out-of-band
data, the  option requests that out-of-band data be placed in the normal
data input queue as received; it will then be accessible with  or  calls
without the  flag. Some protocols always behave as if this option is set.
 and  are options to adjust the normal buffer sizes allocated for output
and input buffers, respectively. The buffer size may be increased for high-volume
connections, or may be decreased to limit the possible backlog of incoming
data. The system places an absolute limit on these values.   is an option
to set the minimum count for output operations. Most output operations process
all of the data supplied by the call, delivering data to the protocol for
transmission and blocking as necessary for flow control. Nonblocking output
operations will process as much data as permitted subject to flow control
without blocking, but will process no data if flow control does not allow
the smaller of the low water mark value or the entire request to be processed.
A  operation testing the ability to write to a socket will return true
only if the low water mark amount could be processed. The default value
for  is set to a convenient size for network efficiency, often 1024.  is
an option to set the minimum count for input operations. In general, receive
calls will block until any (non-zero) amount of data is received, then return
with the smaller of the amount available or the amount requested. The default
value for  is 1. If   is set to a larger value, blocking receive calls normally
wait until they have received the smaller of the low water mark value or
the requested amount. Receive calls may still return less than the low water
mark if an error occurs, a signal is caught, or the type of data next in
the receive queue is different than that returned.   is an option to set
a timeout value for output operations. It accepts a  parameter with the
number of seconds and microseconds used to limit waits for output operations
to complete. If a send operation has blocked for this much time, it returns
with a partial count or with the error  if no data were sent. In the current
implementation, this timer is restarted each time additional data are delivered
to the protocol, implying that the limit applies to output portions ranging
in size from the low water mark to the high water mark for output.  is an
option to set a timeout value for input operations. It accepts a  parameter
with the number of seconds and microseconds used to limit waits for input
operations to complete. In the current implementation, this timer is restarted
each time additional data are received by the protocol, and thus the limit
is in effect an inactivity timer. If a receive operation has been blocked
for this much time without receiving additional data, it returns with a
short count or with the error  if no data were received.  Finally,  and

error on the socket and clears the error status. It may be used to check
for asynchronous errors on connected datagram sockets or for other asynchronous
errors. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
A 0 is returned if the call succeeds, -1 if it fails.

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
The call succeeds unless:   The argument  is not a valid descriptor.
 The argument  is a file, not a socket.  The option is unknown at the level
indicated.  The address pointed to by   is not in a valid part of the process
address space. For  this error may also be returned if  is not in a valid
part of the process address space.
