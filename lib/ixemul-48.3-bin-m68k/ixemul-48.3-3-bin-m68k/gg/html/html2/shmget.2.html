Upon successful completion a positive shared memory
segment identifier is returned. Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global
variable  is set to indicate the error. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
  A shared memory segment
is already associated with  and the caller has no permission to access
it.  Both IPC_CREAT and IPC_EXCL are set in  and a shared memory segment
is already associated with   A new shared memory indentifier could not
be created because the system limit for the number of shared memory identifiers
has been reached.  IPC_CREAT was not set in  and no shared memory segment
associated with  was found.  There is not enough memory left to created
a shared memory segment of the requested size.
