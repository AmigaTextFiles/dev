error checking is performed but no signal is actually sent.  This can be

a signal to a process designated by  the real or effective user ID of the
receiving process must match that of the sending process or the user must
have appropriate privileges (such as given by a set-user-ID program or the
user is the super-user). A single exception is the signal SIGCONT, which
may always be sent to any descendant of the current process.    is sent

the signal is sent to all processes excluding system processes and the
process sending the signal. If the user is not the super user, the signal
is sent to all processes with the same uid as the user excluding the process
sending the signal. No error is returned if any process could be signaled.
  For compatibility with System V, if the process number is negative but
not -1, the signal is sent to all processes whose process group ID is equal
to the absolute value of the process number. This is a variant of

as 0 but the sending process does not have a process group.  The sending
process is not the super-user and its effective user id does not match the

this error is returned if any members of the group could not be signaled.
