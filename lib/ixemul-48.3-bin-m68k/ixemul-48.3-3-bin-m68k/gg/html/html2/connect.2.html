The
parameter  is a socket. If it is of type  this call specifies the peer with
which the socket is to be associated; this address is that to which datagrams
are to be sent, and the only address from which datagrams are to be received.
If the socket is of type  this call attempts to make a connection to another
socket. The other socket is specified by  which is an address in the communications
space of the socket. Each communications space interprets the  parameter
in its own way. Generally, stream sockets may successfully  only once; datagram
sockets may use  multiple times to change their association. Datagram sockets
may dissolve the association by connecting to an invalid address, such
as a null address. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
If the connection or binding succeeds, 0
is returned. Otherwise a -1 is returned, and a more specific error code is
stored in  
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
The  call fails if:    is not a valid descriptor.   is
a descriptor for a file, not a socket.  The specified address is not available
on this machine.  Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used
with this socket.  The socket is already connected.  Connection establishment
timed out without establishing a connection.  The attempt to connect was
forcefully rejected.  The network isn&rsquo;t reachable from this host.  The address
is already in use.  The  parameter specifies an area outside the process
address space.  The socket is non-blocking  and the connection cannot be
completed immediately. It is possible to  for completion by selecting the
socket for writing.  The socket is non-blocking and a previous connection
attempt has not yet been completed.   The following errors are specific
to connecting names in the UNIX domain. These errors may not apply in future
versions of the UNIX IPC domain.   A component of the path prefix is not
a directory.  A component of a pathname exceeded   characters, or an entire
path name exceeded   characters.  The named socket does not exist.  Search
permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.  Write access to
the named socket is denied.  Too many symbolic links were encountered in
translating the pathname.
