function terminates a process with the following consequences:   All of

delays, for example, waiting for output to drain; a process in this state
may not be killed, as it is already dying.  If the parent process of the
calling process has an outstanding  call or catches the  signal, it is
notified of the calling process&rsquo;s termination and the  is set as defined
by   The parent process-ID of all of the calling process&rsquo;s existing child
processes are set to 1; the initialization process (see the DEFINITIONS
section of  inherits each of these processes.  If the termination of the
process causes any process group to become orphaned (usually because the
parents of all members of the group have now exited; see  in  and if any
member of the orphaned group is stopped, the  signal and the  signal are
