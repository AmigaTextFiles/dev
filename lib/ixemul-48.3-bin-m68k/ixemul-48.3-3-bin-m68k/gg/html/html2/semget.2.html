have a semaphore set associated with it, and the IPC_CREAT bit is set in
 
<p> If a new set of semaphores is created, the data structure associated
with it (the  structure, see  is intialized as follows:    and  are set

returned and  is set to reflect the error.

  The caller has no permission

set. 
<p> A semaphore set associated with  exists, but has fewer semaphores
than the number specified in   A new set of semaphores could not be created
because the system limit for the number of semaphores or the number of
semaphore sets has been reached.  IPC_CREAT was not set in  and no semaphore
set associated with  was found.
