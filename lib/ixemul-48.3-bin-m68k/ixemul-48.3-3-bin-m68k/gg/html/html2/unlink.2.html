<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
The 
function removes the link named by  from its directory and decrements the
link count of the file which was referenced by the link. If that decrement
reduces the link count of the file to zero, and no process has the file
open, then all resources associated with the file are reclaimed. If one
or more process have the file open when the last link is removed, the link
is removed, but the removal of the file is delayed until all references
to it have been closed. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
Upon successful completion, a value
of 0 is returned. Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and  is set to indicate
the error. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
The  succeeds unless:   A component of the path prefix
is not a directory.  A component of a pathname exceeded   characters, or
an entire path name exceeded   characters.  The named file does not exist.
 Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.  Write
permission is denied on the directory containing the link to be removed.
 Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname. 
The named file is a directory and the effective user ID of the process
is not the super-user.  The directory containing the file is marked sticky,
and neither the containing directory nor the file to be removed are owned
by the effective user ID.  The entry to be unlinked is the mount point for
a mounted file system.  An I/O error occurred while deleting the directory
entry or deallocating the inode.  The named file resides on a read-only file
system.   points outside the process&rsquo;s allocated address space.
