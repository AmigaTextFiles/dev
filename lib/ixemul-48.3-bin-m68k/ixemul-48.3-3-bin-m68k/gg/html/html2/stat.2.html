The

or execute permission of the named file is not required, but all directories
listed in the path name leading to the file must be searchable.   is like
 except in the case where the named file is a symbolic link, in which case
 returns information about the link, while  returns information about the
file the link references. Unlike other filesystem objects, symbolic links
do not have an owner, group, access mode, times, etc. Instead, these attributes
are taken from the directory that contains the link. The only attributes
returned from an  that refer to the symbolic link itself are the file type
(S_IFLNK), size, blocks, and link count (always 1).  The  obtains the same
information about an open file known by the file descriptor   The  argument

block size for the file.  The actual number of blocks allocated for the
file in 512-byte units. As short symbolic links are stored in the inode,
this number may be zero.   The status information word  has the following
