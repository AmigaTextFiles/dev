 causes
the link named  to be renamed as  If   exists, it is first removed. Both
  and  must be of the same type (that is, both directories or both non-directories),
and must reside on the same file system.   guarantees that an instance of
 will always exist, even if the system should crash in the middle of the
operation.  If the final component of  is a symbolic link, the symbolic
link is renamed, not the file or directory to which it points. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>CAVEAT</a></h2>
The
system can deadlock if a loop in the file system graph is present. This
loop takes the form of an entry in directory  say  being a hard link to
directory  and an entry in directory  say  being a hard link to directory
 When such a loop exists and two separate processes attempt to perform
 and  respectively,  the system may deadlock attempting to lock both directories
for modification. Hard links to directories should be replaced by symbolic
links by the system administrator. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
A 0 value is returned if
the operation succeeds, otherwise  returns -1 and the global variable  
indicates the reason for the failure.

 will fail and neither of the
argument files will be affected if:   A component of a pathname exceeded
  characters, or an entire path name exceeded   characters.  A component
of the  path does not exist, or a path prefix of  does not exist.  A component
of either path prefix denies search permission.  The requested link requires
writing in a directory with a mode that denies write permission.  The directory
containing  is marked sticky, and neither the containing directory nor
 are owned by the effective user ID.  The  file exists, the directory containing
 is marked sticky, and neither the containing directory nor  are owned
by the effective user ID.  Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
either pathname.  A component of either path prefix is not a directory. 
 is a directory, but  is not a directory.   is a directory, but  is not
a directory.  The link named by  and the file named by  are on different
logical devices (file systems).  Note that this error code will not be returned
if the implementation permits cross-device links.  The directory in which
the entry for the new name is being placed cannot be extended because there
is no space left on the file system containing the directory.  The directory
in which the entry for the new name is being placed cannot be extended
because the user&rsquo;s quota of disk blocks on the file system containing the
directory has been exhausted.  An I/O error occurred while making or updating
a directory entry.  The requested link requires writing in a directory on
a read-only file system.   points outside the process&rsquo;s allocated address
space.   is a parent directory of  or an attempt is made to rename  or 
  is a directory and is not empty.
