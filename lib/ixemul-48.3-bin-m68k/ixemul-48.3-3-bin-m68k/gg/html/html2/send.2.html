when the socket is in a   state, while   and  may be used at any time. 
The address of the target is given by  with   specifying its size. The length
of the message is given by  If the message is too long to pass atomically

is not transmitted.  No indication of failure to deliver is implicit in

messages space is available at the socket to hold the message to be transmitted,
then  normally blocks, unless the socket has been placed in non-blocking
I/O mode. The  call may be used to determine when it is possible to send
more data.  The  parameter may include one or more of the following:  #define<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;MSG_OOB
       0x1  /* process out-of-band data */ #define<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;MSG_DONTROUTE  0x4  /*

on sockets that support this notion (e.g.  the underlying protocol must also
support  data.  is usually used only by diagnostic or routing programs. 
See   for a description of the  structure.

The call returns
the number of characters sent, or -1 if an error occurred.

  and  fail
if:   An invalid descriptor was specified.  The argument  is not a socket.
 An invalid user space address was specified for a parameter.  The socket
requires that message be sent atomically, and the size of the message to
be sent made this impossible.  The socket is marked non-blocking and the
requested operation would block.  The system was unable to allocate an internal
buffer. The operation may succeed when buffers become available.  The output
queue for a network interface was full. This generally indicates that the
interface has stopped sending, but may be caused by transient congestion.
