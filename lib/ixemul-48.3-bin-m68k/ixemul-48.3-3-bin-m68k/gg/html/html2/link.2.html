The 
function call atomically creates the specified directory entry (hard link)
 with the attributes of the underlying object pointed at by  If the link
is successful: the link count of the underlying object is incremented;
 and  share equal access and rights to the underlying object.  If  is removed,
the file  is not deleted and the link count of the underlying object is
decremented.   must exist for the hard link to succeed and both  and  must
be in the same file system. Unless the caller is the super-user,  may not
be a directory. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is
returned.  Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and  is set to indicate the
error. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
 will fail and no link will be created if:   A component of
either path prefix is not a directory.  A component of a pathname exceeded
  characters, or an entire path name exceeded   characters.  A component
of either path prefix does not exist.  A component of either path prefix
denies search permission.  The requested link requires writing in a directory
with a mode that denies write permission.  Too many symbolic links were
encountered in translating one of the pathnames.  The file named by  does
not exist.  The link named by  does exist.  The file named by  is a directory
and the effective user ID is not super-user.  The link named by  and the
file named by  are on different file systems.  The directory in which the
entry for the new link is being placed cannot be extended because there
is no space left on the file system containing the directory.   The directory
in which the entry for the new link is being placed cannot be extended
because the user&rsquo;s quota of disk blocks on the file system containing the
directory has been exhausted.  An I/O error occurred while reading from
or writing to  the file system to make the directory entry.  The requested
link requires writing in a directory on a read-only file system.  One of
the pathnames specified is outside the process&rsquo;s allocated address space.
