Access to the file is denied if:
  A component of the path prefix is not a directory.  A component of a pathname
exceeded   characters, or an entire path name exceeded   characters.  The
named file does not exist.  Too many symbolic links were encountered in
translating the pathname.  Write access is requested for a file on a read-only
file system.  Write access is requested for a pure procedure (shared text)
file presently being executed.  Permission bits of the file mode do not
permit the requested access, or search permission is denied on a component
of the path prefix.  The owner of a file has permission checked with respect
to the &lsquo;&lsquo;owner&rsquo;&rsquo; read, write, and execute mode bits, members of the file&rsquo;s group
other than the owner have permission checked with respect to the &lsquo;&lsquo;group&rsquo;&rsquo;
mode bits, and all others have permissions checked with respect to the
&lsquo;&lsquo;other&rsquo;&rsquo; mode bits.   points outside the process&rsquo;s allocated address space.
