The process
group of the current process is returned by   Process groups are used for
distribution of signals, and by terminals to arbitrate requests for their
input: processes that have the same process group as the terminal are foreground
and may read, while others will block with a signal if they attempt to
read.  This call is thus used by programs such as  to create process groups
in implementing job control. The  and  calls are used to get/set the process
group of the control terminal.

This version of  differs
from past Berkeley versions by not taking a  argument. This incompatibility
is required by   From the  Rationale: <p>
4.3BSD provides a  function that returns
the process group ID for a specified process. Although this function is
used to support job control, all known job-control shells always specify
the calling process with this function. Thus, the simpler System V  suffices,
and the added complexity of the 4.3BSD  has been omitted from POSIX.1. <p>
