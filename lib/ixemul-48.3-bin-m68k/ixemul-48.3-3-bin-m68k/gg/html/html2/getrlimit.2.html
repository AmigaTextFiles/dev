Limits
on the consumption of system resources by the current process and each
process it creates may be obtained with the  call, and set with the  call.
   The  parameter is one of the following:   The largest size (in bytes)
 file that may be created.  The maximum amount of cpu time (in seconds)
to be used by each process.  The maximum size (in bytes) of the data segment
for a process; this defines how far a program may extend its break with
the  system call.  The largest size (in bytes) file that may be created.
 The maximum size (in bytes) which a process may lock into memory using
the  function.  The maximum number of open files for this process.  The maximum
number of simultaneous processes for this user id.  The maximum size (in
bytes) to which a process&rsquo;s resident set size may grow. This imposes a limit
on the amount of physical memory to be given to a process; if memory is
tight, the system will prefer to take memory from processes that are exceeding
their declared resident set size.  The maximum size (in bytes) of the stack
segment for a process; this defines how far a program&rsquo;s stack segment may
be extended. Stack extension is performed automatically by the system.  
A resource limit is specified as a soft limit and a hard limit.  When a
soft limit is exceeded a process may receive a signal (for example, if
the cpu time or file size is exceeded), but it will be allowed to continue
execution until it reaches the hard limit (or modifies its resource limit).
 The   structure is used to specify the hard and soft limits on a resource,
 struct rlimit { <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;rlim_t<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;rlim_cur;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* current (soft) limit */<br>
 <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;rlim_t<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;rlim_max;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* hard limit */<br>
 };   Only the super-user may raise the maximum limits.  Other users may
only alter   within the range from 0 to   or (irreversibly) lower   An
 value for a limit is defined as   Because this information is stored in
the per-process information, this system call must be executed directly
by the shell if it is to affect all future processes created by the shell;
 is thus a built-in command to   The system refuses to extend the data or
stack space when the limits would be exceeded in the normal way: a  call
fails if the data space limit is reached. When the stack limit is reached,
the process receives a segmentation fault  if this signal is not caught
by a handler using the signal stack, this signal will kill the process.
 A file I/O operation that would create a file larger that the process&rsquo;
soft limit will cause the write to fail and a signal  to be generated;
this normally terminates the process, but may be caught.  When the soft
cpu time limit is exceeded, a signal  is sent to the offending process.

<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
A 0 return value indicates that the call succeeded, changing
or returning the resource limit.   A return value of -1 indicates that an
error occurred, and an error code is stored in the global location  
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>

and  will fail if:   The address specified for  is invalid.  The limit specified
to  would have raised the maximum limit value, and the caller is not the
super-user.
