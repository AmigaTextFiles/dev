<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
 The
 and  functions provides a method for applications to determine the current
value of a configurable system limit or option variable associated with
a pathname or file descriptor.  For  the  argument is the name of a file
or directory. For  the  argument is an open file descriptor. The  argument
specifies the system variable to be queried. Symbolic constants for each
name value are found in the include file   The available values are as
follows:     The maximum file link count.  The maximum number of bytes in
terminal canonical input line.  The minimum maximum number of bytes for
which space is available in a terminal input queue.  The maximum number
of bytes in a file name.  The maximum number of bytes in a pathname.  The
maximum number of bytes which will be written atomically to a pipe.  Return
1 if appropriate privileges are required for the  system call, otherwise
0.  Return 1 if file names longer than KERN_NAME_MAX are truncated.  Returns
the terminal character disabling value.  
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
If the call to  or
 is not successful, -1 is returned and  is set appropriately. Otherwise,
if the variable is associated with functionality that does not have a limit
in the system, -1 is returned and  is not modified. Otherwise, the current
variable value is returned. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
If any of the following conditions occur,
the  and  functions shall return -1 and set  to the corresponding value.
  The value of the  argument is invalid.  The implementation does not support
an association of the variable name with the associated file.   will fail
if:   A component of the path prefix is not a directory.  A component of
a pathname exceeded 255 characters, or an entire path name exceeded 1023
characters.  The named file does not exist.  Search permission is denied
for a component of the path prefix.  Too many symbolic links were encountered
in translating the pathname.  An I/O error occurred while reading from or
writing to the file system.     will fail if:   is not a valid open file
descriptor.  An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the
file system.
