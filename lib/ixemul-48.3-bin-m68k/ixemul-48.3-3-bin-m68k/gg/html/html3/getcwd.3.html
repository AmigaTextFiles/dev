the name of a working directory for the purpose of returning to it. A much
faster and less error-prone method of accomplishing this is to open the
current directory  and use the  function to return.

Upon successful
completion, a pointer to the pathname is returned. Otherwise a  pointer
is returned and the global variable  is set to indicate the error. In addition,

The  function will fail if:   Read or search permission was denied
for a component of the pathname.  The  argument is zero.  A component of
the pathname no longer exists.  Insufficient memory is available.  The  argument
is greater than zero but smaller than the length of the pathname plus 1.
