The
 function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by  and associates
a stream with it.  The argument  points to a string beginning with one of
the following sequences (Additional characters may follow these sequences.):
  Open text file for reading. The stream is positioned at the beginning
of the file.  Open for reading and writing. The stream is positioned at the
beginning of the file.  Truncate file to zero length or create text file
for writing. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.  Open
for reading and writing. The file is created if it does not exist, otherwise
it is truncated. The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file. 
Open for writing. The file is created if it does not exist. The stream is
positioned at the end of the file.  Open for reading and writing. The file
is created if it does not exist. The stream is positioned at the end of
the file.   The  string can also include the letter &lsquo;&lsquo;b&rsquo;&rsquo; either as a third
character or as a character between the characters in any of the two-character
strings described above. This is strictly for compatibility with  and has
no effect; the &lsquo;&lsquo;b&rsquo;&rsquo; is ignored.  Any created files will have mode  |  |  |  |

intermixed on read/write streams in any order, and do not require an intermediate

however;  requires that a file positioning function intervene between output
and input, unless an input operation encounters end-of-file.  The  function
associates a stream with the existing file descriptor,  The  of the stream
must be compatible with the mode of the file descriptor.  The  function
opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by  and associates the
stream pointed to by  with it. The original stream (if it exists) is closed.
The  argument is used just as in the  function. The primary use of the 
function is to change the file associated with a standard text stream
