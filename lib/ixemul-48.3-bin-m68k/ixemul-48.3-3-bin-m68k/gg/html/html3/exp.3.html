<h2><a name='sect5' href='#toc5'>NOTES</a></h2>
The functions
exp(x)-1 and log(1+x) are called expm1 and logp1 in  on the Hewlett-Packard
 and  Macintosh,  and  in Pascal, exp1 and log1 in C on  Macintoshes, where
they have been provided to make sure financial calculations of ((1+x)**n-1)/x,
namely expm1(n*log1p(x))/x, will be accurate when x is tiny. They also provide
accurate inverse hyperbolic functions.  The function  returns x**0 = 1 for
all x including x = 0, 1 for all x including x = 0, Infinity if (not found
on a  and  (the reserved operand on a  have defined x**0 to be undefined
in some or all of these cases.  Here are reasons for returning x**0 = 1
always:   Any program that already tests whether x is zero (or infinite
or Na) before computing x**0 cannot care whether 0**0 = 1 or not. Any program
that depends upon 0**0 to be invalid is dubious anyway since that expression&rsquo;s
meaning and, if invalid, its consequences  vary from one computer system
to another.  Some Algebra texts (e.g. Sigler&rsquo;s) define x**0 = 1 for  all x,
including x = 0. This is compatible with the convention that accepts a[0]
as the value of polynomial  p(x) = a[0]*x**0 + a[1]*x**1 + a[2]*x**2 +...+
a[n]*x**n   at x = 0 rather than reject a[0]*0**0 as invalid.  Analysts
will accept 0**0 = 1 despite that x**y can approach anything or nothing
as x and y approach 0 independently. The reason for setting 0**0 = 1 anyway
is this:  If x(z) and y(z) are  functions analytic (expandable in power
series) in z around z = 0, and if there  x(0) = y(0) = 0, then x(z)**y(z)
-&gt; 1 as z -&gt; 0.   If 0**0 = 1, then 1, then infinity**0 = 1/0**0 = 1 too; and
if**0 = 1/0**0 = 1 too; and then Na**0 = 1 too because x**0 = 1 for all
finite and infinite x, i.e., independently of x.
