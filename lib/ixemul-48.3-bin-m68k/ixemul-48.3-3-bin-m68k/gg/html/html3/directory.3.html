 enough memory to hold the whole thing.  The  function returns a pointer
to the next directory entry.  It returns  upon reaching the end of the directory
or detecting an invalid  operation.  The  function returns the current location

for the lifetime of the  pointer,  from which they are derived. If the directory
is closed and then reopened, the   value may be invalidated due to undetected
directory compaction. It is safe to use a previous  value immediately after
a call to  and before any calls to   The  function resets the position
of the named  to the beginning of the directory.  The  function closes the

0 on success. On failure, -1 is returned and the global variable  is set
to indicate the error.  The  function returns the integer file descriptor
