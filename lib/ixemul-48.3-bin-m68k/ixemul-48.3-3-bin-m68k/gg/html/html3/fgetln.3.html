<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
The 
function returns a pointer to the next line from the stream referenced
by  This line is  a C string as it does not end with a terminating  character.
The length of the line, including the final newline, is stored in the memory
location to which  points. (Note, however, that if the line is the last
in a file that does not end in a newline, the returned text will not contain
a newline.) 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>RETURN VALUES</a></h2>
Upon successful completion a pointer is returned;
this pointer becomes invalid after the next  operation on  (whether successful
or not) or as soon as the stream is closed. Otherwise,  is returned. The
 function does not distinguish between end-of-file and error; the routines
 and  must be used to determine which occurred. If an error occurs, the
global variable  is set to indicate the error. The end-of-file condition is
remembered, even on a terminal, and all subsequent attempts to read will
return  until the condition is cleared with   The text to which the returned
pointer points may be modified, provided that no changes are made beyond
the returned size. These changes are lost as soon as the pointer becomes
invalid. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
  The argument  is not a stream open for reading.   The  function
may also fail and set  for any of the errors specified for the routines
    or
