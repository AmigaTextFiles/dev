The
 function performs password encryption. It is derived from the  Data Encryption
Standard. Additional code has been added to deter key search attempts. The
first argument to  is a  string (normally a password typed by a user). The
second is a character array, 9 bytes in length, consisting of an underscore
(&lsquo;&lsquo;_&rsquo;&rsquo;) followed by 4 bytes of iteration count and 4 bytes of salt. Both the
iteration  and the   are encoded with 6 bits per character, least significant
bits first. The values 0 to 63 are encoded by the characters &lsquo;&lsquo;./0-9A-Za-z&rsquo;&rsquo;, respectively.
 The  is used to induce disorder in to the  algorithm in one of 16777216
possible ways (specifically, if bit  of the  is set then bits  and  are
swapped in the  &lsquo;&lsquo;E&rsquo;&rsquo; box output). The  is divided into groups of 8 characters
(a short final group is null-padded) and the low-order 7 bits of each character
(56 bits per group) are used to form the DES key as follows: the first
group of 56 bits becomes the initial DES key. For each additional group,
the XOR of the group bits and the encryption of the DES key with itself
becomes the next DES key. Then the final DES key is used to perform  cumulative
encryptions of a 64-bit constant. The value returned is a  string, 20 bytes
in length, consisting of the  followed by the encoded 64-bit encryption.
 For compatibility with historical versions of  the  may consist of 2 bytes
of salt, encoded as above, in which case an iteration  of 25 is used, fewer
perturbations of  are available, at most 8 characters of  are used, and
the returned value is a  string 13 bytes in length.  The functions,    and
 allow limited access to the  algorithm itself. The  argument to  is a 64
character array of binary values (numeric 0 or 1). A 56-bit key is derived
from this array by dividing the array into groups of 8 and ignoring the
last bit in each group.  The  argument  is also a 64 character array of
binary values. If the value of  is 0, the argument  is encrypted, otherwise
it fails. The encryption is returned in the original array  after using
the key specified by  to process it.  The  and  functions are faster but
less portable than  and  The argument to  is a character array of length
8. The  significant bit in each character is ignored and the next 7 bits
of each character are concatenated to yield a 56-bit key. The function  encrypts
the 64-bits stored in the 8 characters at  using  of  iterations of  and
stores the 64-bit result in the 8 characters at  The  specifies perturbations
to  as described above.  The function  returns a pointer to the encrypted
value on success and NULL on failure. The functions    and  return 0 on
success and 1 on failure. Historically, the functions  and  did not return
any value. They have been provided return values primarily to distinguish
implementations where hardware support is provided but not available or
where the DES encryption is not available due to the usual political silliness.

Dropping the  significant
bit in each character of the argument to  is ridiculous.  The  function
leaves its result in an internal static object and returns a pointer to
that object. Subsequent calls to  will modify the same object. <p>
