The  and  functions each return a pointer to an object with
the following structure describing an internet host referenced by name
or by address, respectively. This structure contains either the information
obtained from the name server,  broken-out fields from a line in   or database
entries supplied by the  system . If the local name server is not running
these routines do a lookup in   struct<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;hostent { <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;char<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;*h_name;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* official
name of host */<br>
 <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;char<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;**h_aliases;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* alias list */<br>

 }; #define<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;h_addr  h_addr_list[0]<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* address, for backward compatibility
*/   The members of this structure are:   Official name of the host.  A
zero terminated array of alternate names for the host.  The type of address
being returned; currently always   The length, in bytes, of the address.
 A zero terminated array of network addresses for the host. Host addresses
are returned in network byte order.  The first address in  this is for backward
compatibility.  When using the nameserver,  will search for the named host
in the current domain and its parents unless the name ends in a dot. If
the name contains no dot, and if the environment variable  contains the
name of an alias file, the alias file will first be searched for an alias
matching the input name. See  for the domain search procedure and the alias
file format.  The  function may be used to request the use of a connected
 socket for queries. If the  flag is non-zero, this sets the option to send
all queries to the name server using  and to retain the connection after
each call to   or  Otherwise, queries are performed using  datagrams.  The
 function closes the  connection.

<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>DIAGNOSTICS</a></h2>
Error return status
from   and  is indicated by return of a null pointer. The external integer
 may then be checked to see whether this is a temporary failure or an invalid
or unknown host. The routine  can be used to print an error message describing
the failure. If its argument  is  it is printed, followed by a colon and
a space. The error message is printed with a trailing newline. The routine
 returns a pointer to the message string affiliated with an error number.
The array pointed to is not to be modified by the program.  The variable
 can have the following values:   No such host is known.  This is usually
a temporary error and means that the local server did not receive a response
from an authoritative server. A retry at some later time may succeed.  Some
unexpected server failure was encountered. This is a non-recoverable error.
 The requested name is valid but does not have an IP address;  this is
not a temporary error.   This means that the name is known to the name server
but there is no address associated with this name. Another type of request
to the name server using this domain name will result in an answer; for
example, a mail-forwarder may be registered for this domain.

<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>CAVEAT</a></h2>
The  function is defined, and  and  are redefined, when  is built
to use only the routines to lookup in  and not the name server.  The  function
reads the next line of  opening the file if necessary.  The  function opens
and/or rewinds the file  If the  argument is non-zero, the file will not
be closed after each call to  or   The  function closes the file.

These functions
use static data storage; if the data is needed for future use, it should
be copied before any subsequent calls overwrite it. Only the Internet address
format is currently understood. <p>
