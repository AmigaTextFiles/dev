The  family of functions replaces the current process image
with a new process image. The functions described in this manual page are
front-ends for the function  (See the manual page for  for detailed information
about the replacement of the current process.)  The initial argument for
these functions is the pathname of a file which is to be executed.  The
 and subsequent ellipses in the   and  functions can be thought of as 
 ...,  Together they describe a list of one or more pointers to null-terminated
strings that represent the argument list available to the executed program.
The first argument, by convention, should point to the file name associated
with the file being executed. The list of arguments  be terminated by a
 pointer.  The   and  functions provide an array of pointers to null-terminated
strings that represent the argument list available to the new program. The
first argument, by convention, should point to the file name associated
with the file begin executed. The array of pointers  be terminated by a
 pointer.  The  and  functions also specify the environment of the executed
process by following the  pointer that terminates the list of arguments
in the parameter list or the pointer to the argv array with an additional
parameter. This additional parameter is an array of pointers to null-terminated
strings and  be terminated by a  pointer. The other functions take the environment
for the new process image from the external variable  in the current process.
 Some of these functions have special semantics.  The functions  and  will
duplicate the actions of the shell in searching for an executable file
if the specified file name does not contain a slash  character. The search
path is the path specified in the environment by  variable. If this variable
isn&rsquo;t specified, the default path  is used. In addition, certain errors are
treated specially.  If permission is denied for a file (the attempted  returned
 these functions will continue searching the rest of the search path. If
no other file is found, however, they will return with the global variable
 set to   If the header of a file isn&rsquo;t recognized (the attempted  returned
 these functions will execute the shell with the path of the file as its
first argument. (If this attempt fails, no further searching is done.)  If
the file is currently busy (the attempted  returned  these functions will
sleep for several seconds, periodically re-attempting to execute the file.
 The function  executes a file with the program tracing facilities enabled

occurred. The return value is -1, and the global variable  will be set to
indicate the error.

Historically, the default path for the  and
 functions was  This was changed to place the current directory last to
enhance system security.  The behavior of  and  when errors occur while
attempting to execute the file is historic practice, but has not traditionally
been documented and is not specified by the  standard.  Traditionally, the
functions  and  ignored all errors except for the ones described above
and  and  upon which they returned. They now return if any error other than
the ones described above occurs.
