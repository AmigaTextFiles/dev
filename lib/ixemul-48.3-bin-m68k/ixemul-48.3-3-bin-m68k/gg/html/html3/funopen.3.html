The
 function associates a stream with up to four  Either   or  must be specified;
the others can be given as an appropriately-typed  pointer. These  functions
will be used to read, write, seek and close the new stream.  In general,
omitting a function means that any attempt to perform the associated operation
on the resulting stream will fail. If the close function is omitted, closing
the stream will flush  any buffered output and then succeed.  The calling
conventions of    and  must match those, respectively, of    and  with
the single exception that they are passed the  argument specified to  
in place of the traditional file descriptor argument.  Read and write  functions
are allowed to change the underlying buffer on fully buffered or line buffered
streams by calling  They are also not required to completely fill or empty
the buffer. They are not, however, allowed to change streams from unbuffered
to buffered or to change the state of the line buffering flag. They must
also be prepared to have read or write calls occur on buffers other than
the one most recently specified.  All user  functions can report an error
by returning -1. Additionally, all of the functions should set the external
variable  appropriately if an error occurs.  An error on   does not keep
the stream open.  As a convenience, the include file  defines the macros
 and  as calls to  with only a read or write function specified.

Upon successful completion,   returns a  pointer. Otherwise,  is returned
and the global variable  is set to indicate the error. 
<h2><a name='sect4' href='#toc4'>ERRORS</a></h2>
  The  function
was called without either a read or write function. The  function may also
fail and set  for any of the errors specified for the routine
