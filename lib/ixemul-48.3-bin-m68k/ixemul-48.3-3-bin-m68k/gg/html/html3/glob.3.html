The
 function is a pathname generator that implements the rules for file name
pattern matching used by the shell.  The include file  defines the structure
type  which contains at least the following fields:  typedef struct { <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;int
gl_pathc;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* count of total paths so far */<br>
 <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;int gl_matchc;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* count of paths matching pattern */<br>
 <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;int gl_offs;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* reserved at beginning of gl_pathv */<br>
 <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;int gl_flags;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* returned flags */<br>
 <tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;char **gl_pathv;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;<tt> </tt>&nbsp;/* list of paths matching pattern */<br>
 } glob_t;   The argument  is a pointer to a pathname pattern to be expanded.
The  argument matches all accessible pathnames against the pattern and
creates a list of the pathnames that match. In order to have access to a
pathname,  requires search permission on every component of a path except
the last and read permission on each directory of any filename component
of  that contains any of the special characters   or   The  argument stores
the number of matched pathnames into the  field, and a pointer to a list
of pointers to pathnames into the  field. The first pointer after the last
pathname is  If the pattern does not match any pathnames, the returned
number of matched paths is set to zero.  It is the caller&rsquo;s responsibility
to create the structure pointed to by  The  function allocates other space

when it encounters a directory that it cannot open or read. Ordinarily,
 continues to find matches.  Each pathname that is a directory that matches
 has a slash appended.  If  does not match any pathname, then  returns a

and the number of matched pathnames set to 0. If  is set, its effect is
present in the pattern returned.  By default, the pathnames are sorted in
ascending  order; this flag prevents that sorting (speeding up    The following

initialized with alternate functions for glob to use to open, read, and
close directories and to get stat information on names found in those directories.

provided to simplify implementing the historic  globbing behavior and should
probably not be used anywhere else.  Use the backslash  character for quoting:
every occurrence of a backslash followed by a character in the pattern
is replaced by that character, avoiding any special interpretation of the
character.  Expand patterns that start with  to user name home directories.

matched. This also happens if an error is encountered and  is set in  regardless
of the return value of  if called. If  is not set and either  is  or  returns
zero, the error is ignored.  The  function frees any space associated with

A rough equivalent of  can be obtained with the following
code:  glob_t g; 
<p> g.gl_offs = 2; glob("*.c", GLOB_DOOFFS, NULL, &amp;g); glob("*.h",
GLOB_DOOFFS | GLOB_APPEND, NULL, &amp;g); g.gl_pathv[0] = "ls"; g.gl_pathv[1] =

The  function is expected
to be  compatible with the exception that the flags      and  and the fields
  and   should not be used by applications striving for strict  conformance.
