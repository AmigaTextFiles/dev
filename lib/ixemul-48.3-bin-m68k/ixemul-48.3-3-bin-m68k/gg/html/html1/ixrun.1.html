ixrun - run AmigaOS scripts from within /bin/sh

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>
<i>Ixrun</i> makes it possible to run AmigaOS scripts from /bin/sh
or from other Unix programs. The <i>ixemul.library</i> uses the first line of a
file to find out to which program it should feed the file. Normally this
is <i>/bin/sh</i>, but you can use any program you want. Shell scripts usually
start with <b>#!/bin/sh</b>. Unfortunately, AmigaOS scripts use a semi-colon to
start a comment, not the <b>#</b>-sign. However, the <i>ixemul.library</i> also accepts
<b>;!</b>. So one would expect that starting a script with <b>;!/c/execute</b> would work.
But it doesn&rsquo;t. First of all, <i>c:execute</i> does some weird things that prevent
us from using this possibility. Secondly, AmigaOS won&rsquo;t recognize the <b>.key</b>
sequence unless it is at the beginning of the script. To work around this
second problem, the <i>ixemul.library</i> skips the first line of the script if
it starts with <b>.key</b>. So you should put the <b>;!</b> sequence at the second line
instead. If you  <i>don&rsquo;t</i> use  <b>.key</b>, then you should put the <b>;!</b> sequence at the
beginning of the script as usual. <p>
To work around the first problem I wrote
<i>ixrun</i>, a small utility to replace <i>c:execute</i>. Just start an AmigaOS script
with <b>;!/bin/ixrun</b> (possibly preceeded by the  <b>.key</b> line) and you can now
run it from within <i>/bin/sh</i> or any other Unix program. 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Options</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>-n</b> </dt>
<dd>Don&rsquo;t put
quotes around the arguments. </dd>

<dt><b>-q</b> </dt>
<dd>Put quotes around every argument that you
pass to your script. This is the default. <i>ixrun</i> builds a command line which
starts with the filename of the script (the  <b>filename</b> argument) followed
by the other arguments passed to <i>ixrun</i>. This command line is executed by
calling the <i>dos.library</i> function <i>Execute</i>. That is, <b></b> ixrun script "Hello world"
will execute <b></b> script "Hello <b>world"</b>, as one would expect. But <b></b> ixrun -n script
"Hello world" will execute <b></b> script Hello <b>world</b>. That is, the single argument
<b>Hello world</b> has been split into two. So take care. </dd>

<dt><b>-qv</b> </dt>
<dd>Debugging: show the
command line that should be executed if the option <b>-q</b> was used, without
actually executing it. </dd>

<dt><b>-nv</b> </dt>
<dd>Debugging: show the command line that should be
executed if the option <b>-n</b> was used, without actually executing it. </dd>
