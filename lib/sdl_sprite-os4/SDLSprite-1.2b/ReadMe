SDLSprite ? What's this ?

 The SDLSprite library in based on the CDXSprite library from the excellent CDX project (but unlikely it's only for Windows...).

 This C++ class contains the datas and functions required to display animated sprites. A SDLSprite object is created from 
 BMP picture which is used to strore data for the sprite.
 Beware : All the sprite's frames must be the same width and height and stored in the same BMP file.

 The SDLSprite-1.2.tar.gz file also contains another class : SDLSpriteList 1.1 which permits to store sprites in a dynamic fashion.
 A SDLSpriteList is a linked list of SDLSprite objects, which can be added and removed at run-time.

How to use it ? It's simple :

1) Put SDLSprite.cpp, SDLSprite.h,  SDLSpriteList.cpp and SDLSpriteList.h in your source directory.
2) Add this line at the beginning of your code :
   #include "SDLSprite.h"
   #include "SDLSpriteList.h"
3) Add SDLSprite.cpp and SDLSpriteList.cpp to your project (for example, if you use KDevelop just go to Project choose Add a file to 
   project and choose SDLSprite.cpp and SDLSpriteList.cpp in your source directory)
4) Compile and it works !
