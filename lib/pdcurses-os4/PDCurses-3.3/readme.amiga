I made a copy of libpdcurses.a and renamed it to libncurses.a,
to make configure scripts find and use pdcurses.
As we don't, and will not have a port of NCurses on OS4 in the
forseeable future I think this is the best solution for now.
It will save you from a lot of configure/makefile editing.

Just delete libncurses.a if you don't want it to work in this way.
