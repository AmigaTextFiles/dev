2004-05-02: flatzebra 0.1.1

    New classes RCouple and RSprite that allow one to write games
    with coordinates in real numbers instead of integers.
    Some convenience functions have been added.
    The audio "chunk size" is now 128 bytes instead of 256, to help
    avoid delays before a sound effect is heard.

2003-06-02: flatzebra 0.1.0

    New name to reform the version numbers.

    The library is now defined in the `flatzebra' C++ namespace.

    There is no flatzebra.m4 anymore.  Use pkg-config with
    'flatzebra-1.0' as the module name.

    Sound mixer class added.  Key state class added.

    SDL_HWSURFACE not used anymore when setting up full screen mode:
    it has been reported to cause much flickering under Mac OS X,
    and it does not seem to be required under GNU/Linux anyway.
    Cleanup of makefiles.

2002-04-03: gengameng 4.1

    Library now comes with a "dynamic" gengameng-config script that
    replaces the "static" gengamengConf.sh script.  The latter takes
    the options --version, --cflags, --libs and --help, in a manner
    similar to sdl-config.

    There is a homegrown sdl_image.m4 in macros/ that tries to link
    with the SDL_image library, which is needed in addition to SDL.
    SDL_image is available at <http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/>.

    These changes do not affect the binary interface of the library.
    This is why only the minor version number has increased.

2001-11-25: gengameng 4.0 released

    Programs that use this library should use an #include directive
    of this form:

	#include <gengameng/GameEngine.h>

    instead of:

	#include <GameEngine.h>

    Those programs will thus better document which headers are taken
    for this library.

2001-04-27: gengameng 3.0 released

    This version now uses SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/).

2001-03-24: gengameng 2.1 started

    The statement

	#include "PixmapLoadError.h"

    was added in src/GameEngine.h to make this file compile under
    RedHat 7.0, which uses g++ 2.96.  I use g++ 2.95.2 under
    RedHat 6.2.

    Also, gengameng 2.1 does not link with libXaw nor libXmu anymore.
    Preceding versions used superfluous -l directives.

    The library's interface does not change because of this,
    so only the "release" number is incremented.

2001-03-13: gengameng 2.0 released

    Version 2.0 avoids polling the keyboard with XQueryKeymap()
    and expects instead to be informed of key state changes upon
    KeyPress and KeyRelease events.  See xtmain.cc in BurgerSpace
    for an example of how to get those events and how to transmit
    the information to the game engine.

    This change seems to solve some of the problems of people who
    reported that the game did not receive any keyboard input.
    However, there are still reports of similar problems.
