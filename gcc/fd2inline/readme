fd2inline is, as you already might have guessed, "simply" an update to
the known GCC fd-to-inline converter. It produces now REALLY correct
inliner's according to the most recent 2.6.x syntax, doing EVERYTHING
needed by the compiler. Just redirect the output of fd2inline into
your inline-subdirectory, that' all. Usage is left the same.

The reason why I did it was the extremly buggy (and ugly) output of
the original fd2inline when I needed it first. Because of the steadily
increasing number of libraries this may be a very useful tool to every-
one who wants to program with the excellent GNU C-compiler.
One more probably interesting remark concerning GNU-C:
I am using a (very) mixed 2.3.3/2.6.x environment in order to be able
to access the baserel/noixemul switches appropriatly. See makefile, too.
