			      HISTORY of APurify
			      ------------------

			    (c) by Samuel DEVULDER

- V1.0: + First public release.

- V1.1: + Fix bug if the parsed code uses something like

			link	#-TMP01,A5
			....
		TMP01	equ	10

	  The minus  sign  was	badly  interpreted  as	link  #0,A5,  which
	  produces  a  bad  stack  usage   (local   variables   scratching)
	  if TMP01!=0 (that is to say most of the time :-).

	+ Improved speed while freeing symbol  (DICE  is  slow  at  freeing
	  memory).

	+ Better error diagnostic in source parsing. Usage of  source  line
	  number.

	+ Fix	bug  causing  spurious	warning  about	missing   xref/xdef
	  statement.

	+ Added AP_Report(flag)  to  stop(flag=0)/start(flag=1)  report  of
	  errors (for startup code).

	+ Added "*" for some block-names.

	+ Fixed bug in  inspreinst()  to  put  the  label, rest & nb_hat of 
	  current instruction to  the  one  added.  (It was just a bug if a
	  opcode bears a label on the same line...)

- V1.2: + Change the protocol of APlib funccall.
	+ Made a special version for GCC.
	+ Added AP_Err()
	+ fixed move 4:w,a6 in APserv.s
	+ replace the standard malloc()/free()/realloc() by mine since libnix
	  uses Alloc() which does not allow to really know which memory belongs
	  to the program or the system.
	+ Get rid of french documentation file... It's *VERY* painfull to
	  keep two documentation file update.

- V1.2.1:
	+ Get rid of -DFRANCAIS.
	+ Check if AllocMem & FreeMem are not re-patched on closing.
	+ Added CacheClearU(). 				\
	+ Added atexit(AP_Close) in AP_Init. Need nomore|
	  calls to AP_Close.				|
	+ Usage of inline & protos		 	|
	+ Added Verbose mode: AP_Verbose() & new output | Thanx Joerg-Cyril
	+ Added environment variable APlog. 		| Hoehle !
	+ Added PC, Segment & offset information when 	|
	  available.					/
