 I. What is it ?
   ------------

GccOpts is a program that allows you to automatically and quickly write a
Makefile  for the Amiga GCC. It's simple enough, I hope, not to need any 
documentation, so don't be too much disturbed if I don't offer you 
megabytes of precise informations about this program (anyway I am reachable
thru many net-addresses).

This program provides you a useful and graphical interface to easely make 
your Makefiles for Amiga GCC. It needs AmigaOS 2.0 or +, and of course the
ixemul.library. An example of a project with a graphical interface is
provided in the package (see Example), have a look on it if you really
don't know how works a makefile.

Just install it in your path, and enjoy (yes, this is real
plug-and-play :))


  What is a makefile ?
  ------------------

  A "makefile" is a scriptfile that describes your project (the different
componants of your program: c files, includes, objects files, libraries,
etc).

  This file (which may be called makefile, or Makefile, or GNUMakefile)
will be used by a program, called "make", whose job is to always keep your
project correctly updated. So, if the program does not exist yet, it will
simply compile it entirely. Or else it will compare the date and time of
the source file with the date and time of the compiled file, and will
compile it if,and only if, needed. All of this according to the rules
described in the makefile.

  This provide a very powerly and easy-to-use developping system for the
programmer.






 II. How the does it work ?
    ----------------------

Firstly you should install GccOpts by copying it to the gnu:bin/
directory.

Launch GccOpts from the CLI or the Workbench, and have a look on the panel
that just opened on the screen. On the right, a group named "Project" 
contains a listview and some other gadgets. There are also two other 
groups, "Libraries" and "Options". You'll have to refer to the concerned
section of the manual for further information about each of this groups. 

After having filled some gadget with some random value of your own, press
the gadget "Save Makefile", and the GccOpts will save a Makefile which
purpose is to make you compile your project with the gnu Make command.

If you don't want to save the Makefile you have done or modified, just
click on the "Cancel" gadget or on the upper-left CloseWindow gadget.





III. The "Project" group.
     --------------------

In this group, the programmer (you!) will need to give some useful 
informations about the project he (you, ever) want the Makefile to be
done for.

First of all, the "Project" listview must contain all the  files that are
part of the projet. The given files can be any *.c or *.o file (GccOpts
will process them differently in the  makefile, however). Include files
are accepted, and gcc will be told to use them, with the directive under
the form :"-i your_include.h -i another_include.h"... If you add any *.o or
*.a file in the project listview, it will be added to the Makefile as an
archive that should not to be deleted by the "clean" rule.

To add a name into the listview, just type it inside the string gadget 
below, and press enter. To delete one entry, select it with the mouse, and
click on the DEL gadget below the listview. The gadget "?" will pop up a
filerequester, and if you select a file with it, this one will be added to
the listview. You can also let the program automatically choose the project
files, by clicking the "SCAN" gadget. GccOpts will then scan all the files 
in the current directory, and insert in the listview every .c file.

Three cycle gadgets below the listview can be used to select some options
about the code generation. This gadgets are :

"Code" : which refers to the processor your project will be generated 
for : 68000 - 68020 - 68030 - 68040/020-881 - 68040.

"Fpu" : only allows two value (could have been a boolean thing), fpu or 
not : 68881 or NONE, default is NONE.

"Optimize" will permit to select the level of optimization for your 
program : NONE, LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2, or LEVEL 3. Choose it in peace with 
your concience and your memory (and you'll need some for the third level).

Another, last but not least, gadget allows you to select the name of the 
output file. So the name of the gadget, you'd have guessed it, you clever
programmer, is "Output". The name you give it will be used as the first
rule of the Makefile, so that "make NAME_OF_YOUR_PROGRAM_IN_OUTPUT" will 
just compile all the newer part of your project. This is the same than 
"Make" alone, as this is the first rule of the Makefile.

That's all for the "Projet" group.






IV. The "Libraries" group.
    ----------------------

This group contains only one gadget, a listview, into which the  clever
programmer will put the names of all the libraries that its project will
need to be linked with. To know how to add an entry to the listview, please
refer to the previous "Project group" section.

The name of the library can be either the normal file name, ie. 
"libamiga.a" (without quotes) , or either "amiga". "libamiga" will also be
accepted. This names will be inserted into the project as libraries, and 
will be refered in the Makefile as "-lamiga".







V. The "Options" group.
   -------------------

This group contain a listview that will contain some of the options you 
can need for your project. To flag or un-flag an option, just go onto the
listview gadget, and click on the option you want to select/deselect. An 
option is currently selected if a "*" is added at its beginning.

This options are divided into 6 parts : Code generation, Linking, Stack,
Optimizing, Debugging, and  Warning. For more information about them,
please read the gcc documention (click here -->READ GCC.GUIDE to do so).
However, Names are quite clear, you shouldn't have problems with them, and
if you have, you can contact me for more informations.







VI. The Makefile.
    -------------

The generated Makefile should not be modified if you want it to be 
correctly re-processed by GccOpts. The makefile should be run by the Make
command.

This Makefile contains three useful entries for the clever programmer :

- all : This rules will call the two others, clean and compile, and your
project will be fully recompiled.

- clean : this will clean-up the project, ie. just remove every *.o file
leading around.

- YOUR_PROJECT_NAME :  will recompile only the new or modified files,
and create an executable named YOUR_PROJECT_NAME, according to the 
informations and options given. The program will recursively scan the given
c-source file for non-system include files (the token " #include" should be
at the beginning of the line, with no blank or tabulation). Non-system
include files are those bracketed with \" (while standart system includes
should be bracketed with '<' and '>', and won't be scanned). All this
includes will be linked to the correct c files that call them.

The default rule executed by Make (alone) is YOUR_PROJECT_NAME. In order to
be able to re-read it correctly, GccOpts puts special informations inside
the created Makefile, so don't modify it if you want to re-use later the
result of your (not so) hard work.







  VII. The example.

  A very simple example is provided, and will quickl show you how GccOpts
works. The program to compile is simply an "Hello world", and has strictly
no importance. If Gccopts is not installed in your system, you should copy
it in the gnu:bin/ directory.

  In the workbench screen, open the drawer "GccOpts_Example", and click on
the Options icon. This icon will call the GccOpts program (which should
already be installed in the gnu:bin/ or C: directory).

  There you can modify the compiler options. Once done, just click on the
"Save Makefile" gadget. The makefile will be saved, and the program will
close its window and shut down. Then, you can double-click on the
MakeProject icon. This script will open a shell window and call the make
program.

  You can also start GccOpts from a shell, and do just the same as above.
To compile the project, just type "make" or "make all" in the shell.

  Please note that the program will be recompiled only if the c-source file
is modified.






VIII. Misc.
     -----

This program is totally freeware, if you paid for this, be sure I have not
seen a penny of your money. The source of this program is also free, 
although not distributed, just ask for it, and I'll E-Mail it uuencoded
to you.

Of course the author gives no warranty at all for this program, it may not
work at all, crash your computer, destroy your terminal, invit your 
stepmother at home for a full month, or any other terrible disaster, that's
YOUR business and YOUR responsability in using this program.

Thanks to Philippe Brand for its wise advices.


 TO DO:
 ------

   - Flex & bison support
   - coffee-machine support
   - Whatever you clever programmer will tell me...
