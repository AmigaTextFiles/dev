Short: AmigaGuide-based manual browser
Author: stieber@informatik.tu-muenchen.de (Christian Stieber)

This is a "new" version 1.1. The previous distribution had
a line missing in the ManualBrowser.guide file.

This  program lets you browse through a directory tree using
AmigaGuide.   Click  on  a directory to enter it, click on a
file  to view it.
Viewers can be assigned to files based on filename-patterns.

Requires AmigaOS 3.0 (V39) or later.
