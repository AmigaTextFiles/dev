@node Introduction "Introduction to the manual browser"

What  does this program do?  Well, it is something like an AmigaGuide-based
directory  browser.  You start at a directory, and the browser will display
its contents.  Every directory and every file will be a button.  Click on a
directory-button  to  enter  that directory; click on a file-button to view
the file.

With  this program, you can put all your online documentation into a nicely
organized  directory  structure  for easy viewing.  It is intended to be an
"xman" type program for the Amiga.

@node Author "How to contact the author"

If  you  want  to contact me for any reason, for example bugs, suggestions,
gifts or praise -:), here is my address:

   Christian Stieber
   Konradstraße 41
   D-85055 Ingolstadt
   (Germany)

Mail  sent  to this address should reach me in any case, although I may not
actually live there.  It might take a while for the mail to reach me.

I do not have a permanent EMail address (yet?).

Currently  (1994)  I'm  a  student,  and  can  be  reached at the following
address:

   Christian Stieber
   Seitzstraße 6, Zi. 306
   D-80538 München
   (Germany)

   EMail: Stieber@Informatik.TU-Muenchen.de

It's probably not a good idea to send postal mail to my student-address; if
I'm  not  there anymore people might just throw the mail away --- you never
know.

I will answer all EMail and all the mail that has sufficient return postage
included  (of  course, if you send some $$, you don't have to include extra
return  postage  -:)).   If  you tell me your EMail address, I'll use it to
answer your mail if I can.

I'm  planning  to  get  a  modem and some connection to the internet when I
leave university, so EMail hopefully won't be a problem.

@node Problems "Known problems"

Currently  requires AmigaOS 3.0 or later.  I have no idea why:  if compiled
for  V37  and  run  it with AmigaOS 2.x, it doesn't work.  No error.  Maybe
it's a problem with V34 amigaguide.library.

If  you enter a directory, take out the disk, click on "Retrace" and cancel
the  requester,  you'll  be stuck.  You'll see the error message, but there
won't be any buttons --- all you can do is close the window.

@node Config "Configuration file"

When  you  start  the  program, it will look for a configuration file.  The
following files will be read, in the order listed:

   PROGDIR:ManualBrowser.config
   S:ManualBrowser.config
   ENV:ManualBrowser.config

Configuration files assign viewers to patterns:

   PATTERN/A,ACTION/A/F

"PATTERN"  is  a standard AmigaDOS filename pattern; note that it will only
be applied to the filename portion.  The directory portion is ignored.
See your AmigaDOS manual for a description of AmigaDOS-patterns.

"ACTION" is a command that can be put into the AmigaGuide LINK-command.

Example:
   #?.dvi   SYSTEM "TeX:bin/ShowDVI %f"
tells   the   browser   that   #?.dvi   files  should  be  displayed  using
TeX:bin/ShowDVI.

The following %-commands may be used:
   %f   filename
   %p   pathname
   %F   filename without extension

Additionally, there are two special commands:
   IGNORE    do not display these files (no button will be created)
   DEFAULT   use the default action

If  a  filename matches two or more patterns, the last pattern read will be
used.

Sample configuration file:

#?.info                 IGNORE
.#?                     IGNORE
#?.dvi                  SYSTEM "TeX:bin/ShowDVI %f"
#?.(doc|dok|txt)        SYSTEM "Work:Specials/Most %f"


Also, whenever a directory is entered ManualBrowser looks for a file called
".Config".   If  such  a  file  is  found, it will be read.  This file only
covers the directory it is stored in.

You  will probably use this feature to assign viewers to a single file that
you don't want to mention in your global ManualBrowser.config.

@endnode

@node Message "The .Message-files"

Whenever  a  directory  is  read,  the  program  looks  for  a  file called
".Message".  If such a file is found, its contents will be displayed before
the directory contents.

This  can  be used to display a headline or a description of the directory,
very much like the ".msg" files on ftp-servers.

@endnode

@node Plans "Some things that should be done"

   - make ".Config" files cover a directory tree?

   - something like a global table of contents (how?)

@endnode

@node Using "Usage information"

The  program  may  be  started from the Shell or from Workbench.  Currently
there is only one argument/tooltype:

   MANUALDIR=MANDIR=DIR: Your manual-directory. Defaults to "man:".
