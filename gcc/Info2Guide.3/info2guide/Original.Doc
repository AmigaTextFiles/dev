Info2Guide

  This is a simple (full of bugs) ARexx program that can translate into Amiga-
Guide format Info-files that comes within GCC packge (roundabout 22M).
  These  files can  be found into GCC:info/ path , and can  be  read  with the
file `InfoView' tha comes  with  the packge . The matter is that the viewer is
quite  user-unfriendly  (you must take  control  via keyboard and commands are
very very very ...).
  Here this simple prog comes in. Let's suppose you wanna read something about
`diff'; related files are (you must look into GCC:info/):
    - `diff.info'
    - `diff.info-1'
    - `diff.info-2'
    - `diff.info-3'
    - `diff.info-4'
  Now you only have to invoke the "function" with parameter "diff" . Automati-
cally it will process these files , and the result  will  be a unique big file
containing proper nodes.

  Please note that some translation (from Info to AmigaGuide) doesn't fit: for
example it cannot propely translate information if node declaration falls down
between to different (but consecutive) lines (you may fix this editing manual-
ly resulting text).

  Please note  that manipulating  very big files is quite inefficient : better
achievement  would have been mantaining  separate files (note that  AmigaGuide
do support this).

  Please note that initial intent of Info archive was to organize all informa-
tions under the only index called `dir', but I've found hard to realize with a
very light code (written in ARexx).

  Please  note that  I have no documentation that  describes how the `*.info*'
files are structured and  organized (but if you have it , you can E-Mail it to
me: I'll like).

P.S.: If you really want a faster implementation, you can bring to me sugges-
      tions about the GCC. For example:
        -1- How can I make GCC to compile programs?
            I've installed the full packge and nowI got version 2.5.7 of prog
            but something doesn't match: nothing appens when I execute
                CLI> gcc Prova.c
            HardDrive works, but no output can be find.
            I've also tried with
                CLI> gcc -o RAM:exe Prova.c
            but nothing can be find in RAM: too.

            My sistem configuration is:
                Amiga 1200 68EC020 14MHz, no FPU, 2Mb CHIP, AmigaOS 3.0
                Workbench 39.29 - Kickstart 39.106

        -2- How can I find ARexx compile? Are there some PD compiler?

History

      1.0     Very first implementation. ARexx was the language adopted. Never
              released.

      1.1     A merely correction of previous version. Fixed bug that made
              uncorrect translation of linked sub-nodes when they were not
              preceded by `* ':this was achieved including `Strip' command
              in the source. (Note that linked-nodes are recognised if and
              only if they are successed by `::')

Please note that I do not want assume any responsability about provided prog.
                   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
It is made only upon my exclusive conception, and it do not represend a tran-
slation of some algorithm or program written in any other language.

P.S. I've included that because this is the very first time I release any prog
     in PD . I'm sure that no one will seriously consider it , but I'm  afraid
     about various misunderstanding.

Let me know if you are interested in ARexx programming (I'll also like to know
your programming tecnique). If you use Internet my E-Mail is:
