This is a simple update to Mr Ponzio's original Arexx script.  I hope he doesn't mind me UL'ing this.
This document is designed to be in conjunction with the original read me.

Update.

-- First:  This doc.  I had a hard time understanding exactly how the program was supposed
   to work, so I thought a better explanation was in order.

-- Second: Mr Ponzio's script used very specific path names for file placement that wouldn't have fit
   most peoples installations.  I changed these.  Now input files are expected from Gcc:info/ where
   they should have been placed by default.  If Gcc was installed properly GCC: should be assigned to
   whatever directory the program is in, and the info directory should have been created and its files
   automatically installed.  If for some reason you're setup is different, simply assign gcc: to
   wherever the installation was created. i.e.  assign gcc: work:gcc.
   Output files, that is those .guide files created by info2guide are stored in output:  You will have
   to assign output: to where ever you want the file(s) created.  A good place is in the Ram disk.  So
   if you wanted them in the Ram disk simply do this at a command prompt.  assign output: ram:  or if
   you wanted them in your work:amigaguids directory say assign output: work:amigaguids  NOTE:  some
   amigaguide file can get quite large, > 1 meg in some cases.


Now for finite instructions.

1)  Make sure GCC: is assigned to the proper place (see above)
2)  Assign output: to where you want the output file to go (see above)
3)  Make sure the rexx inturpriter is running.  Rexx is a seperate program needed if you want to use
    this script.  You may be able to get it off of BBS's or the Internet if you don't already have it.
4)  At a shell or cli prompt type    rx info2guide.rexx filename  Where filename is one of the groups
    of file in the gcc:info/ directory. For example, to process gcc.info-1 through gcc.info-23 you
    would type     rx info2guide.rexx gcc   This is assuming that info2guide is in the gcc:info/
    directory.
5)  Wait for a couple of years, now aren't you gald you have a multitasking computer. :)
