This directory contains test programs and demonstration programs for
the SIPP library. The images here can be divided into two
categories: the mere test images (boring) and the demonstrations
images (impressive).

All the testprograms takes the following switches:

        -p      Render with PHONG shading.
        -g      Render with GOURAUD shading.
        -f      Render with FLAT shading.
        -l      Render a LINE image.
        -s n    Make the image (n X n) pixels big.

If no switches are given, the default is to render a (256 X 256) pixels
big image with PHONG shading. Note that if "-l" is used, the resulting
image will be a bitmap and have ".pbm" as extension instead of ".ppm".

torus.ppm               torustest       A plain violet torus
cone.ppm                conetest        One ordinary cone, one truncated
                                        and one cylinder.
ellipsoid.ppm           ellipsoid       A violet course ellipsoid.
                                        Note how the surface of the
                                        ellipsoid appears smooth in
                                        spite of the low number of
                                        polygons in it (PHONG mode).
prism.ppm               prismtest       Three orange prisms of various form.
strauss.ppm             strausstest     Demo of the strauss_shader(). Four
                                        spheres with the same color but
                                        different smoothness and metalness.
wood.ppm                woodtest        Demo of the wood shader.

chain.ppm               chain           A 3-D chain of torii.
teapot.ppm              teapot          The standard classic Newell
                                        teapot. This image demonstrates
                                        shadows and transparency mapping.
structure.ppm           structure       A geometric structure,
                                        demonstrating "eroded"
                                        appearance of a surface
planet.ppm              planettest      A planet with fractal coasts
                                        and clouds.
isy90.ppm               isy90           The cover of the 1990
                                        Activity Report at the Dept.
                                        of EE at Linkoping University.  
                                        Demonstrates simulated marble and
                                        granite texture.
