This directory contains a small demonstration of how one can create an
animation using the SIPP library. When run, it will produce a sequence of 24
images which is an animation of a somersaulting marble teapot on top of a
checkered floor.

The motions are designed to be a "closed loop", i.e. the sequence can be shown
many consecutive times and the motions should still look continuous.

The default rendering mode is lines, so that nobody accidently overflows his
diskspace, but any rendering mode (and image size) can be chosen using the
same flags as in the other demonstration programs (see ../README).
