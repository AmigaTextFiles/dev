This is SIPP, the SImple Polygon Processor, version 3.0.  SIPP is a
library for creating 3-dimensional scenes and rendering them using a
scan-line z-buffer algorithm.  A scene is built up of objects which
can be transformed with rotation, translation and scaling.  The
objects form hierarchies where each object can have arbitrarily many
subobjects and subsurfaces.  A surface is a number of connected
polygons which are rendered with either Phong, Gouraud or flat
shading.  An image can also be rendered as a line drawing of the
polygon edges without any shading at all.

The library supports texture mapping with textures in up to
3-dimensions and automatic interpolation of texture coordinates.
Simple anti-aliasing can be performed through oversampling.  A scene
can be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources and a
number of different lightsources are availiable.  The light from some
of them are capable of casting shadows of objects.  A basic shading
algorithm is provided with the library, but the user can also use his
own shading algorithms for each surface to produce special effects.
Objects can have varying degree of transparency, controlled by the
shader.

It is possible to create several virtual cameras and use any of them
as viewpoint for a particular rendering.

Images can be rendered directly onto a file in the Portable Pixmap
format (ppm) (or, for line images, Portable Bitmap, pbm) or written
using user-supplied functions.  This function can, for instance,
write into a pixmap in memory or into a screen window or anything
else.


To view the images there are several programs which can display the
ppm format.  If the X-window system is availiable we can recommend the
programs xv and xloadimage.  Both are availiable by anonymous ftp from
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in the contrib directory, and probably
from several other sites also.  The pbmplus package wich can convert
the ppm format into a large number of other formats (GIF, TIFF, etc.)
is also availiable by anonymous ftp from the same site.


To install the library, the demonstration programs and the manuals,
see the file INSTALL for details.


The directory 'doc' contains standard UNIX man pages for quick
reference, and also a complete "User's Guide" in texinfo format.  To
make a typeset version of this manual you need the TeX typesetting
system.  You can also create an online info-manual of this document,
either with the program 'makeinfo' or in GNU-emacs with the command
M-X texinfo-format-buffer.  Here also, see the file INSTALL for more
details.


If you have used SIPP before, you might notice a number of
incompatibilities with version 2.0 and 2.1.  The file COMPATIBILITY
describes what features are incompatible with the older versions and
how you can compile your old programs with the new library.


Please send any enhancements, bug reports and fixes to us.
Especially, if you create nice new object types or interesting
shaders, we would be grateful if you sent the C functions to us.  We
could then compile a library of object functions and/or shaders and
let other people share the benefits.
