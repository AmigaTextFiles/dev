                Hi There

This  is  a  little utility to convert fd-files and prototypes to
inline functions for gcc in  order  to  directly  call  any  exec
library from within your GNU-C programs. This is a 0.9 version in
order to let you see what's coming.


    bin/auto

This is a (g)awk script,  which  extracts  protos  from  autodocs
(gee, are they ugly). This script is called by bin/auto2proto. It
is VERY tolerant, but the autodocs are even more tolerant... They
contain  many  misformed  headers. Most errors will be listed and
functions which might be functions you actually  wanted  will  be
appended with the word 'maybe'. So look through the output !!!

    bin/auto2proto

This  SKsh  script  calls  awk  with  auto  and scans through all
autodocs for function prototypes. Output is put into  proto/  and
errorlogs are put into error/.

    inline.mk

This  Makefile  controls  the  making of proto/* and inline/* and
calls auto2proto and fd2inline. It is generated  by  bin/mandeps,
which is called by Makefile.

    Makefile

The  global  makefile contains stuff for configuring and starting
the other programs. Just read  it  and  adapt  it  for  your  own
installation.

    fd2inline

This  is  a  GNU-C  Program,  which  parses  fd-files  and  proto
includes, and outputs inline calls for GNU-C. I started  this  as
an  exercise for object oriented thinking and was surprized by my
productivity... It should give meaningful errormessages ( meaning
that  there's an error in the input and not in the program... ;-)
). You should expect errors like that it can't  find  some  func-
tions  or the number of arguments don't fit... that's because CBM
people don't know what good documentation  is  good  for...  yes,
documentation,  well,  this  IS  a  0.9 version, it will improve.
Please don't use any source yet, the 1.0 will be absolutely  free
and  under  the  GNU  Licence.  Use  this version for bugreports,
should there be any...

    BUGS

Well, not really a bug, but something you should not  copy:  When
^C  is  hit,  the  program does not do any cleanup with atexit().
This does not hurt at the moment, but it *IS* dirty. This will be
fixed for 1.0.


    P.S.

I  just ripped the needed files together, invented a Makefile and
put it into an archive. If something is missing or  your  Hardisk
is  low-level formatted, that's completely tough luck, as I don't
imply any usability.... (I hate legal stuff). Please try  it  out
and send reports to

Enjoy,
