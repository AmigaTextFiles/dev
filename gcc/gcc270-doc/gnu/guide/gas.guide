Overview
********

   Here is a brief summary of how to invoke `{No Value For "AS"}'.  For
details, see @{"Comand-Line Options" Link "Invoking"}.

     {No Value For "AS"} [ -a[dhlns] ] [ -D ] [ -f ] [ --help ]
      [ -I DIR ] [ -J ] [ -K ] [ -L ] [ -o OBJFILE ]
      [ -R ] [ --statistics ] [ -v ] [ -version ] [ --version ]
      [ -W ] [ -w ] [ -x ] [ -Z ]
      [ -- | FILES ... ]

`-a[dhlns]'
     Turn on listings, in any of a variety of ways:

    `-ad'
          omit debugging directives

    `-ah'
          include high-level source

    `-al'
          include assembly

    `-an'
          omit forms processing

    `-as'
          include symbols

     You may combine these options; for example, use `-aln' for assembly
     listing without forms processing.  By itself, `-a' defaults to
     `-ahls'--that is, all listings turned on.

`-D'
     Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with
     calls to other assemblers.

`-f'
     "fast"--skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is
     compiler output).

`--help'
     Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

`-I DIR'
     Add directory DIR to the search list for `.include' directives.

`-J'
     Don't warn about signed overflow.

`-K'
     This option is accepted but has no effect on the {No Value For
     "TARGET"} family.

`-L'
     Keep (in the symbol table) local symbols, starting with `L'.

`-o OBJFILE'
     Name the object-file output from `{No Value For "AS"}' OBJFILE.

`-R'
     Fold the data section into the text section.

`--statistics'
     Print the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in seconds)
     used by assembly.

`-v'
`-version'
     Print the `as' version.

`--version'
     Print the `as' version and exit.

`-W'
     Suppress warning messages.

`-w'
     Ignored.

`-x'
     Ignored.

`-Z'
     Generate an object file even after errors.

`-- | FILES ...'
     Standard input, or source files to assemble.

Structure of this Manual
========================

   This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use GNU
`{No Value For "AS"}'.  We cover the syntax expected in source files,
including notation for symbols, constants, and expressions; the
directives that `{No Value For "AS"}' understands; and of course how to
invoke `{No Value For "AS"}'.

   We also cover special features in the {No Value For "TARGET"}
configuration of `{No Value For "AS"}', including assembler directives.

   On the other hand, this manual is *not* intended as an introduction
to programming in assembly language--let alone programming in general!
In a similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine
architecture; we do *not* describe the instruction set, standard
mnemonics, registers or addressing modes that are standard to a
particular architecture.

{No Value For "AS"}, the GNU Assembler
======================================

   GNU `as' is really a family of assemblers.  This manual describes
`{No Value For "AS"}', a member of that family which is configured for
the {No Value For "TARGET"} architectures.  If you use (or have used)
the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a fairly similar
environment when you use it on another architecture.  Each version has
much in common with the others, including object file formats, most
assembler directives (often called "pseudo-ops") and assembler syntax.

   `{No Value For "AS"}' is primarily intended to assemble the output
of the GNU C compiler `{No Value For "GCC"}' for use by the linker `{No
Value For "LD"}'.  Nevertheless, we've tried to make `{No Value For
"AS"}' assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same
machine would assemble.

   Unlike older assemblers, `{No Value For "AS"}' is designed to
assemble a source program in one pass of the source file.  This has a
subtle impact on the `.org' directive (see @{"`.org'" Link "Org"}).

Object File Formats
===================

   The GNU assembler can be configured to produce several alternative
object file formats.  For the most part, this does not affect how you
write assembly language programs; but directives for debugging symbols
are typically different in different file formats.  See
@{"Symbol Attributes" Link "Symbol Attributes"}.  On the {No Value For "TARGET"}, `{No Value For
"AS"}' is configured to produce {No Value For "OBJ-NAME"} format object
files.

Command Line
============

   After the program name `{No Value For "AS"}', the command line may
contain options and file names.  Options may appear in any order, and
may be before, after, or between file names.  The order of file names is
significant.

   `--' (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
explicitly, as one of the files for `{No Value For "AS"}' to assemble.

   Except for `--' any command line argument that begins with a hyphen
(`-') is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of `{No Value For
"AS"}'.  No option changes the way another option works.  An option is
a `-' followed by one or more letters; the case of the letter is
important.   All options are optional.

   Some options expect exactly one file name to follow them.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible with
older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU
standard).  These two command lines are equivalent:

     {No Value For "AS"} -o my-object-file.o mumble.s
     {No Value For "AS"} -omy-object-file.o mumble.s

@Node "Input Files" "gas.guide/Input Files"
@Next "Object"

@Toc "Overview"

Input Files
===========

   We use the phrase "source program", abbreviated "source", to
describe the program input to one run of `{No Value For "AS"}'.  The
program may be in one or more files; how the source is partitioned into
files doesn't change the meaning of the source.

   The source program is a concatenation of the text in all the files,
in the order specified.

   Each time you run `{No Value For "AS"}' it assembles exactly one
source program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)

   You give `{No Value For "AS"}' a command line that has zero or more
input file names.  The input files are read (from left file name to
right).  A command line argument (in any position) that has no special
meaning is taken to be an input file name.

   If you give `{No Value For "AS"}' no file names it attempts to read
one input file from the `{No Value For "AS"}' standard input, which is
normally your terminal.  You may have to type ctl-D to tell `{No Value
For "AS"}' there is no more program to assemble.

   Use `--' if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in
your command line.

   If the source is empty, `{No Value For "AS"}' produces a small,
empty object file.

Filenames and Line-numbers
--------------------------

   There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files)
and either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to
a line number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
"logical" file.  See @{"Error and Warning Messages" Link "Errors"}.

   "Physical files" are those files named in the command line given to
`{No Value For "AS"}'.

   "Logical files" are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file names
help error messages reflect the original source file, when `{No Value
For "AS"}' source is itself synthesized from other files.  See
@{"`.app-file'" Link "App-File"}.

Output (Object) File
====================

   Every time you run `{No Value For "AS"}' it produces an output file,
which is your assembly language program translated into numbers.  This
file is the object file.  Its default name is `a.out'.  You can give it
another name by using the `-o' option.  Conventionally, object file
names end with `.o'.  The default name is used for historical reasons:
older assemblers were capable of assembling self-contained programs
directly into a runnable program.  (For some formats, this isn't
currently possible, but it can be done for the `a.out' format.)

   The object file is meant for input to the linker `{No Value For
"LD"}'.  It contains assembled program code, information to help `{No
Value For "LD"}' integrate the assembled program into a runnable file,
and (optionally) symbolic information for the debugger.


@EndNode

@Node "Errors" "gas.guide/Errors"
@Prev "Object"
@Toc "Overview"

Error and Warning Messages
==========================

   `{No Value For "AS"}' may write warnings and error messages to the
standard error file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen
when  a compiler runs `{No Value For "AS"}' automatically.  Warnings
report an assumption made so that `{No Value For "AS"}' could keep
assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave problem that stops
the assembly.

   Warning messages have the format

     file_name:NNN:Warning Message Text

(where NNN is a line number).  If a logical file name has been given
(see @{"`.app-file'" Link "App-File"}) it is used for the filename, otherwise the name of
the current input file is used.  If a logical line number was given
(see @{"`.line'" Link "Line"}) then it is used to calculate the number printed,
otherwise the actual line in the current source file is printed.  The
message text is intended to be self explanatory (in the grand Unix
tradition).

   Error messages have the format
     file_name:NNN:FATAL:Error Message Text
   The file name and line number are derived as for warning messages.
The actual message text may be rather less explanatory because many of
them aren't supposed to happen.

Command-Line Options
********************

   This chapter describes command-line options available in *all*
versions of the GNU assembler; see @{"Machine Dependencies" Link "Machine Dependencies"}, for options
specific to the {No Value For "TARGET"}.

   If you are invoking `{No Value For "AS"}' via the GNU C compiler
(version 2), you can use the `-Wa' option to pass arguments through to
the assembler.  The assembler arguments must be separated from each
other (and the `-Wa') by commas.  For example:

     gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c

emits a listing to standard output with high-level and assembly source.

   Usually you do not need to use this `-Wa' mechanism, since many
compiler command-line options are automatically passed to the assembler
by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver with the `-v'
option to see precisely what options it passes to each compilation
pass, including the assembler.)


 @{" a " Link "a"}              -a[dhlns] enable listings
 @{" D " Link "D"}              -D for compatibility
 @{" f " Link "f"}              -f to work faster
 @{" I " Link "I"}              -I for .include search path

 @{" K " Link "K"}              -K for compatibility

 @{" L " Link "L"}              -L to retain local labels
 @{" o " Link "o"}              -o to name the object file
 @{" R " Link "R"}              -R to join data and text sections
 @{" statistics " Link "statistics"}     -statistics to see statistics about assembly
 @{" v " Link "v"}              -v to announce version
 @{" W " Link "W"}              -W to suppress warnings
 @{" Z " Link "Z"}              -Z to make object file even after errors


@EndNode

@Node "a" "gas.guide/a"
@Next "D"
@Toc "Invoking"

Enable Listings: `-a[dhlns]'
============================

   These options enable listing output from the assembler.  By itself,
`-a' requests high-level, assembly, and symbols listing.  You can use
other letters to select specific options for the list: `-ah' requests a
high-level language listing, `-al' requests an output-program assembly
listing, and `-as' requests a symbol table listing.  High-level
listings require that a compiler debugging option like `-g' be used,
and that assembly listings (`-al') be requested also.

   Use the `-ad' option to omit debugging directives from the listing.

   Once you have specified one of these options, you can further control
listing output and its appearance using the directives `.list',
`.nolist', `.psize', `.eject', `.title', and `.sbttl'.  The `-an'
option turns off all forms processing.  If you do not request listing
output with one of the `-a' options, the listing-control directives
have no effect.

   The letters after `-a' may be combined into one option, *e.g.*,
`-aln'.


@EndNode

@Node "D" "gas.guide/D"
@Next "f"
@Prev "a"
@Toc "Invoking"

`-D'
====

   This option has no effect whatsoever, but it is accepted to make it
more likely that scripts written for other assemblers also work with
`{No Value For "AS"}'.


@EndNode

@Node "f" "gas.guide/f"
@Next "I"
@Prev "D"
@Toc "Invoking"

Work Faster: `-f'
=================

   `-f' should only be used when assembling programs written by a
(trusted) compiler.  `-f' stops the assembler from doing whitespace and
comment preprocessing on the input file(s) before assembling them.  See
@{"Preprocessing" Link "Preprocessing"}.

     *Warning:* if you use `-f' when the files actually need to be
     preprocessed (if they contain comments, for example), `{No Value
     For "AS"}' does not work correctly.


@EndNode

@Node "I" "gas.guide/I"
@Next "K"
@Prev "f"
@Toc "Invoking"

`.include' search path: `-I' PATH
=================================

   Use this option to add a PATH to the list of directories `{No Value
For "AS"}' searches for files specified in `.include' directives (see
@{"`.include'" Link "Include"}).  You may use `-I' as many times as necessary to include a
variety of paths.  The current working directory is always searched
first; after that, `{No Value For "AS"}' searches any `-I' directories
in the same order as they were specified (left to right) on the command
line.


@EndNode

@Node "K" "gas.guide/K"
@Next "L"
@Prev "I"
@Toc "Invoking"

Difference Tables: `-K'
=======================

   On the {No Value For "TARGET"} family, this option is allowed, but
has no effect.  It is permitted for compatibility with the GNU
assembler on other platforms, where it can be used to warn when the
assembler alters the machine code generated for `.word' directives in
difference tables.  The {No Value For "TARGET"} family does not have
the addressing limitations that sometimes lead to this alteration on
other platforms.


@EndNode

@Node "L" "gas.guide/L"
@Next "o"
@Prev "K"
@Toc "Invoking"

Include Local Labels: `-L'
==========================

   Labels beginning with `L' (upper case only) are called "local
labels". See @{"Symbol Names" Link "Symbol Names"}.  Normally you do not see such labels when
debugging, because they are intended for the use of programs (like
compilers) that compose assembler programs, not for your notice.
Normally both `{No Value For "AS"}' and `{No Value For "LD"}' discard
such labels, so you do not normally debug with them.

   This option tells `{No Value For "AS"}' to retain those `L...'
symbols in the object file.  Usually if you do this you also tell the
linker `{No Value For "LD"}' to preserve symbols whose names begin with
`L'.

   By default, a local label is any label beginning with `L', but each
target is allowed to redefine the local label prefix.


@EndNode

@Node "o" "gas.guide/o"
@Next "R"
@Prev "L"
@Toc "Invoking"

Name the Object File: `-o'
==========================

   There is always one object file output when you run `{No Value For
"AS"}'.  By default it has the name `a.out'.  You use this option
(which takes exactly one filename) to give the object file a different
name.

   Whatever the object file is called, `{No Value For "AS"}' overwrites
any existing file of the same name.


@EndNode

@Node "R" "gas.guide/R"
@Next "statistics"
@Prev "o"
@Toc "Invoking"

Join Data and Text Sections: `-R'
=================================

   `-R' tells `{No Value For "AS"}' to write the object file as if all
data-section data lives in the text section.  This is only done at the
very last moment:  your binary data are the same, but data section
parts are relocated differently.  The data section part of your object
file is zero bytes long because all its bytes are appended to the text
section.  (See @{"Sections and Relocation" Link "Sections"}.)

   When you specify `-R' it would be possible to generate shorter
address displacements (because we do not have to cross between text and
data section).  We refrain from doing this simply for compatibility with
older versions of `{No Value For "AS"}'.  In future, `-R' may work this
way.


@EndNode

@Node "statistics" "gas.guide/statistics"
@Next "v"
@Prev "R"
@Toc "Invoking"

Display Assembly Statistics: `--statistics'
===========================================

   Use `--statistics' to display two statistics about the resources
used by `{No Value For "AS"}': the maximum amount of space allocated
during the assembly (in bytes), and the total execution time taken for
the assembly (in CPU seconds).


@EndNode

@Node "v" "gas.guide/v"
@Next "W"
@Prev "statistics"
@Toc "Invoking"

Announce Version: `-v'
======================

   You can find out what version of as is running by including the
option `-v' (which you can also spell as `-version') on the command
line.


@EndNode

@Node "W" "gas.guide/W"
@Next "Z"
@Prev "v"
@Toc "Invoking"

Suppress Warnings: `-W'
=======================

   `{No Value For "AS"}' should never give a warning or error message
when assembling compiler output.  But programs written by people often
cause `{No Value For "AS"}' to give a warning that a particular
assumption was made.  All such warnings are directed to the standard
error file.  If you use this option, no warnings are issued.  This
option only affects the warning messages: it does not change any
particular of how `{No Value For "AS"}' assembles your file.  Errors,
which stop the assembly, are still reported.


@EndNode

@Node "Z" "gas.guide/Z"
@Prev "W"
@Toc "Invoking"

Generate Object File in Spite of Errors: `-Z'
=============================================

   After an error message, `{No Value For "AS"}' normally produces no
output.  If for some reason you are interested in object file output
even after `{No Value For "AS"}' gives an error message on your
program, use the `-Z' option.  If there are any errors, `{No Value For
"AS"}' continues anyways, and writes an object file after a final
warning message of the form `N errors, M warnings, generating bad
object file.'

Syntax

   This chapter describes the machine-independent syntax allowed in a
source file.  `{No Value For "AS"}' syntax is similar to what many other
assemblers use; it is inspired by the BSD 4.2 assembler.

@Node "Preprocessing" "gas.guide/Preprocessing"

@Toc "Syntax"

Preprocessing
=============

   The `{No Value For "AS"}' internal preprocessor:
   * adjusts and removes extra whitespace.  It leaves one space or tab
     before the keywords on a line, and turns any other whitespace on
     the line into a single space.

   * removes all comments, replacing them with a single space, or an
     appropriate number of newlines.

   * converts character constants into the appropriate numeric values.

   It does not do macro processing, include file handling, or anything
else you may get from your C compiler's preprocessor.  You can do
include file processing with the `.include' directive (see @{"`.include'" Link "Include"}).
You can use the GNU C compiler driver to get other "CPP" style
preprocessing, by giving the input file a `.S' suffix.  See
@{"Options Controlling the Kind of Output" Link "gcc.info/Overall Options"}.

   Excess whitespace, comments, and character constants cannot be used
in the portions of the input text that are not preprocessed.

   If the first line of an input file is `#NO_APP' or if you use the
`-f' option, whitespace and comments are not removed from the input
file.  Within an input file, you can ask for whitespace and comment
removal in specific portions of the by putting a line that says `#APP'
before the text that may contain whitespace or comments, and putting a
line that says `#NO_APP' after this text.  This feature is mainly
intend to support `asm' statements in compilers whose output is
otherwise free of comments and whitespace.

@Node "Whitespace" "gas.guide/Whitespace"

@Toc "Syntax"

Whitespace
==========

   "Whitespace" is one or more blanks or tabs, in any order.
Whitespace is used to separate symbols, and to make programs neater for
people to read.  Unless within character constants (see
@{"Character Constants" Link "Characters"}), any whitespace means the same as exactly one
space.


@EndNode

@Node "Comments" "gas.guide/Comments"
@Next "Symbol Intro"
@Prev "Whitespace"
@Toc "Syntax"

Comments
========

   There are two ways of rendering comments to `{No Value For "AS"}'.
In both cases the comment is equivalent to one space.

   Anything from `/*' through the next `*/' is a comment.  This means
you may not nest these comments.

     /*
       The only way to include a newline ('\n') in a comment
       is to use this sort of comment.
     */
     
     /* This sort of comment does not nest. */

   Anything from the "line comment" character to the next newline is
considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is see
See @{"Machine Dependencies" Link "Machine Dependencies"}.

   To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with `#'
have a special interpretation.  Following the `#' should be an absolute
expression (see @{"Expressions" Link "Expressions"}): the logical line number of the *next*
line.  Then a string (see @{"Strings" Link "Strings"}) is allowed: if present it is a new
logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be whitespace.

   If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)

                               # This is an ordinary comment.
     # 42-6 "new_file_name"    # New logical file name

Symbols
=======

   A "symbol" is one or more characters chosen from the set of all
letters (both upper and lower case), digits and the three characters
`_.$'.  No symbol may begin with a digit.  Case is significant.  There
is no length limit: all characters are significant.  Symbols are
delimited by characters not in that set, or by the beginning of a file
(since the source program must end with a newline, the end of a file is
not a possible symbol delimiter).  See @{"Symbols" Link "Symbols"}.

Statements
==========

   A "statement" ends at a newline character (`\n') or at a semicolon
(`;').  The newline or semicolon is considered part of the preceding
statement.  Newlines and semicolons within character constants are an
exception: they do not end statements.

   It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file:  the last
character of any input file should be a newline.

   You may write a statement on more than one line if you put a
backslash (`\') immediately in front of any newlines within the
statement.  When `{No Value For "AS"}' reads a backslashed newline both
characters are ignored.  You can even put backslashed newlines in the
middle of symbol names without changing the meaning of your source
program.

   An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is
ignored.

   A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot `.' then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language "instruction": it
assembles into a machine language instruction.

   A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (`:').
Whitespace before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not
have whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon. See @{"Labels" Link "Labels"}.

Character Constants
-------------------

   There are two kinds of character constants.  A "character" stands
for one character in one byte and its value may be used in numeric
expressions.  String constants (properly called string *literals*) are
potentially many bytes and their values may not be used in arithmetic
expressions.


 @{" Strings " Link "Strings"}                      Strings

Strings
.......

   A "string" is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to "escape" these characters: precede them with a
backslash `\' character.  For example `\\' represents one backslash:
the first `\' is an escape which tells `{No Value For "AS"}' to
interpret the second character literally as a backslash (which prevents
`{No Value For "AS"}' from recognizing the second `\' as an escape
character).  The complete list of escapes follows.

`\b'
     Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.

`\f'
     Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.

`\n'
     Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.

`\r'
     Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.

`\t'
     Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.

`\ DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT'
     An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.  For
     compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as
     digits: for example, `\008' has the value 010, and `\009' the
     value 011.

`\\'
     Represents one `\' character.

`\"'
     Represents one `"' character.  Needed in strings to represent this
     character, because an unescaped `"' would end the string.

`\ ANYTHING-ELSE'
     Any other character when escaped by `\' gives a warning, but
     assembles as if the `\' was not present.  The idea is that if you
     used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
     interpretation of the following character.  However `{No Value For
     "AS"}' has no other interpretation, so `{No Value For "AS"}' knows
     it is giving you the wrong code and warns you of the fact.

   Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think the
BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C compilers
recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape sequence.

@Node "Chars" "gas.guide/Chars"

Characters
..........

   A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  The same escapes apply to characters as to
strings.  So if you want to write the character backslash, you must
write `'\\' where the first `\' escapes the second `\'.  As you can
see, the quote is an acute accent, not a grave accent.  A newline (or
semicolon `;') immediately following an acute accent is taken as a
literal character and does not count as the end of a statement.  The
value of a character constant in a numeric expression is the machine's
byte-wide code for that character.  `{No Value For "AS"}' assumes your
character code is ASCII: `'A' means 65, `'B' means 66, and so on.

Number Constants
----------------

   `{No Value For "AS"}' distinguishes three kinds of numbers according
to how they are stored in the target machine.  *Integers* are numbers
that would fit into an `int' in the C language.  *Bignums* are
integers, but they are stored in more than 32 bits.  *Flonums* are
floating point numbers, described below.

Integers
........

   A binary integer is `0b' or `0B' followed by zero or more of the
binary digits `01'.

   An octal integer is `0' followed by zero or more of the octal digits
(`01234567').

   A decimal integer starts with a non-zero digit followed by zero or
more digits (`0123456789').

   A hexadecimal integer is `0x' or `0X' followed by one or more
hexadecimal digits chosen from `0123456789abcdefABCDEF'.

   Integers have the usual values.  To denote a negative integer, use
the prefix operator `-' discussed under expressions (see
@{"Prefix Operators" Link "Prefix Ops"}).

Bignums

   A "bignum" has the same syntax and semantics as an integer except
that the number (or its negative) takes more than 32 bits to represent
in binary.  The distinction is made because in some places integers are
permitted while bignums are not.

Flonums
.......

   A "flonum" represents a floating point number.  The translation is
indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
`{No Value For "AS"}' to a generic binary floating point number of more
than sufficient precision.  This generic floating point number is
converted to a particular computer's floating point format (or formats)
by a portion of `{No Value For "AS"}' specialized to that computer.

   A flonum is written by writing (in order)
   * The digit `0'.

   * A letter, to tell `{No Value For "AS"}' the rest of the number is
     a flonum.

   * An optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

   * An optional "integer part": zero or more decimal digits.

   * An optional "fractional part": `.' followed by zero or more
     decimal digits.

   * An optional exponent, consisting of:

        * An `E' or `e'.

        * Optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

        * One or more decimal digits.

   At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

   `{No Value For "AS"}' does all processing using integers.  Flonums
are computed independently of any floating point hardware in the
computer running `{No Value For "AS"}'.

Background
==========

   Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
"in" those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker `{No Value For "LD"}' reads many object files (partial
programs) and combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When
`{No Value For "AS"}' emits an object file, the partial program is
assumed to start at address 0.  `{No Value For "LD"}' assigns the final
addresses for the partial program, so that different partial programs
do not overlap.  This is actually an oversimplification, but it
suffices to explain how `{No Value For "AS"}' uses sections.

   `{No Value For "LD"}' moves blocks of bytes of your program to their
run-time addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as
rigid units; their length does not change and neither does the order of
bytes within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a *section*.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called "relocation".  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.

   An object file written by `{No Value For "AS"}' has at least three
sections, any of which may be empty.  These are named "text", "data" and
"bss" sections.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address `0', the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   To let `{No Value For "LD"}' know which data changes when the
sections are relocated, and how to change that data, `{No Value For
"AS"}' also writes to the object file details of the relocation needed.
To perform relocation `{No Value For "LD"}' must know, each time an
address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?

   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?

   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric
     value of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?

   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address `{No Value For "AS"}' ever uses is expressed
as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)

Further, most expressions `{No Value For "AS"}' computes have this
section-relative nature.

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N
into section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
"absolute" section.  When `{No Value For "LD"}' mixes partial programs,
addresses in the absolute section remain unchanged.  For example,
address `{absolute 0}' is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by `{No
Value For "LD"}'.  Although the linker never arranges two partial
programs' data sections with overlapping addresses after linking, *by
definition* their absolute sections must overlap.  Address `{absolute
239}' in one part of a program is always the same address when the
program is running as address `{absolute 239}' in any other part of the
program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the "undefined" section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section *undefined*.

   By analogy the word *section* is used to describe groups of sections
in the linked program.  `{No Value For "LD"}' puts all partial
programs' text sections in contiguous addresses in the linked program.
It is customary to refer to the *text section* of a program, meaning all
the addresses of all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for
data and bss sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by `{No Value For "LD"}'; others are
invented for use of `{No Value For "AS"}' and have no meaning except
during assembly.

{No Value For "LD"} Sections
============================

   `{No Value For "LD"}' deals with just four kinds of sections,
summarized below.

     These sections hold your program.  `{No Value For "AS"}' and `{No
     Value For "LD"}' treat them as separate but equal sections.
     Anything you can say of one section is true another.

*bss section*
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold unitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

*absolute section*
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that `{No
     Value For "LD"}' must not change when relocating.  In this sense
     we speak of absolute addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not
     change during relocation.

*undefined section*
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects
     not in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+
     partial program # 1:  |ttttt|dddd|00|

{No Value For "AS"} Internal Sections
=====================================

   These sections are meant only for the internal use of `{No Value For
"AS"}'.  They have no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to
know about these sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned
in `{No Value For "AS"}' warning messages, so it might be helpful to
have an idea of their meanings to `{No Value For "AS"}'.  These
sections are used to permit the value of every expression in your
assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means
     there is a bug in the assembler.

expr section
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.


@EndNode

@Node "Sub-Sections" "gas.guide/Sub-Sections"

@Toc "Sections"

Sub-Sections
============

   You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want
to end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are
not contiguous in the assembler source.  `{No Value For "AS"}' allows
you to use "subsections" for this purpose.  Within each section, there
can be numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects
assembled into the same subsection go into the object file together
with other objects in the same subsection.  For example, a compiler
might want to store constants in the text section, but might not want
to have them interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this
case, the compiler could issue a `.text 0' before each section of code
being output, and a `.text 1' before each group of constants being
output.

   Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.) The object file contains no representation of subsections;
`{No Value For "LD"}' and other programs that manipulate object files
see no trace of them.  They just see all your text subsections as a
text section, and all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a `.text EXPRESSION' or
a `.data EXPRESSION' statement.  EXPRESSION should be an absolute
expression.  (See @{"Expressions" Link "Expressions"}.)  If you just say `.text' then `.text 0'
is assumed.  Likewise `.data' means `.data 0'.  Assembly begins in
`text 0'.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a "location counter" incremented by one for every
byte assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to `{No Value For "AS"}' there is no concept of
a subsection location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate
a location counter--but the `.align' directive changes it, and any
label definition captures its current value.  The location counter of
the section where statements are being assembled is said to be the
"active" location counter.

bss Section
===========

   The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   Addresses in the bss section are allocated with special directives;
you may not assemble anything directly into the bss section.  Hence
there are no bss subsections. See @{"`.comm'" Link "Comm"}, see @{"`.lcomm'" Link "Lcomm"}.

Labels
======

   A "label" is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
`:'.  The symbol then represents the current value of the active
location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.
You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different
locations: the first definition overrides any other definitions.

Giving Symbols Other Values
===========================

   A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol,
followed by an equals sign `=', followed by an expression (see
@{"Expressions" Link "Expressions"}).  This is equivalent to using the `.set' directive.  See
@{"`.set'" Link "Set"}.


@EndNode

@Node "Symbol Names" "gas.guide/Symbol Names"
@Next "Dot"
@Prev "Setting Symbols"
@Toc "Symbols"

Symbol Names
============

   Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of `._'.  On most
machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names; exceptions are noted in
See @{"Machine Dependencies" Link "Machine Dependencies"}.  That character may be followed by any string
of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in See
@{"Machine Dependencies" Link "Machine Dependencies"}), and underscores.

   Case of letters is significant: `foo' is a different symbol name
than `Foo'.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

   Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
There are ten local symbol names, which are re-used throughout the
program.  You may refer to them using the names `0' `1' ... `9'.  To
define a local symbol, write a label of the form `N:' (where N
represents any digit).  To refer to the most recent previous definition
of that symbol write `Nb', using the same digit as when you defined the
label.  To refer to the next definition of a local label, write
`Nf'--where N gives you a choice of 10 forward references.  The `b'
stands for "backwards" and the `f' stands for "forwards".

   Local symbols are not emitted by the current GNU C compiler.

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, but
remember that at any point in the assembly you can refer to at most 10
prior local labels and to at most 10 forward local labels.

   Local symbol names are only a notation device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler
uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table, appearing in
error messages and optionally emitted to the object file have these
parts:

`L'
     All local labels begin with `L'. Normally both `{No Value For
     "AS"}' and `{No Value For "LD"}' forget symbols that start with
     `L'. These labels are used for symbols you are never intended to
     see.  If you use the `-L' option then `{No Value For "AS"}'
     retains these symbols in the object file. If you also instruct
     `{No Value For "LD"}' to retain these symbols, you may use them in
     debugging.

`DIGIT'
     If the label is written `0:' then the digit is `0'.  If the label
     is written `1:' then the digit is `1'.  And so on up through `9:'.

A'
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
     `\001'.

`*ordinal number*'
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
     `0:' gets the number `1'; The 15th `0:' gets the number `15';
     *etc.*.  Likewise for the other labels `1:' through `9:'.

   For instance, the first `1:' is named `LA1', the 44th `3:' is named
`LA44'.

The Special Dot Symbol
======================

   The special symbol `.' refers to the current address that `{No Value
For "AS"}' is assembling into.  Thus, the expression `melvin: .long .'
defines `melvin' to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to `.'
is treated the same as a `.org' directive.  Thus, the expression
`.=.+4' is the same as saying `.space 4'.

Symbol Attributes
=================

   Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, `{No Value For "AS"}'
assumes zero for all these attributes, and probably won't warn you.
This makes the symbol an externally defined symbol, which is generally
what you would want.


 @{" Symbol Value " Link "Symbol Value"}                 Value
 @{" Symbol Type " Link "Symbol Type"}                  Type

Value
-----

   The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which
labels a location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value
is the number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as `{No Value For "LD"}' changes section base addresses during linking.
Absolute symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why
they are called absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
`{No Value For "LD"}' tries to determine its value from other files
linked into the same program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by
mentioning a symbol name without defining it.  A non-zero value
represents a `.comm' common declaration.  The value is how much common
storage to reserve, in bytes (addresses).  The symbol refers to the
first address of the allocated storage.

Type
----

   The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact
format depends on the object-code output format in use.

Expressions
***********

   An "expression" specifies an address or numeric value.  Whitespace
may precede and/or follow an expression.

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute,
and there is not enough information when `{No Value For "AS"}' sees the
expression to know its section, a second pass over the source program
might be necessary to interpret the expression--but the second pass is
currently not implemented.  `{No Value For "AS"}' aborts with an error
message in this situation.

@Toc "Expressions"

Empty Expressions
=================

   An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and `{No Value For "AS"}' assumes a value of (absolute) 0.
This is compatible with other assemblers.

Integer Expressions
===================

   An "integer expression" is one or more *arguments* delimited by
*operators*.


 @{" Arguments " Link "Arguments"}                    Arguments
 @{" Operators " Link "Operators"}                    Operators
 @{" Prefix Ops " Link "Prefix Ops"}                   Prefix Operators
 @{" Infix Ops " Link "Infix Ops"}                    Infix Operators


@EndNode

@Node "Arguments" "gas.guide/Arguments"
@Next "Operators"
@Toc "Integer Exprs"

Arguments
---------

   "Arguments" are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other
contexts arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this
manual, to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the
machine language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of
expressions only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine
instruction operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and `{No Value For "AS"}'
pretends these 32 bits are an integer.  You may write
integer-manipulating instructions that act on exotic constants,
compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis `(' followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis `)'; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.

Operators
---------

   "Operators" are arithmetic functions, like `+' or `%'.  Prefix
operators are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between
their arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by
whitespace.

Prefix Operator
---------------

   `{No Value For "AS"}' has the following "prefix operators".  They
each take one argument, which must be absolute.

`-'
     "Negation".  Two's complement negation.

`~'
     "Complementation".  Bitwise not.

Infix Operators
---------------

   "Infix operators" take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from `+' or `-', both arguments must be absolute, and
the result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

    `*'
          "Multiplication".

    `/'
          "Division".  Truncation is the same as the C operator `/'

    `%'
          "Remainder".

    `<'
    `<<'
          "Shift Left".  Same as the C operator `<<'.

    `>'
    `>>'
          "Shift Right".  Same as the C operator `>>'.

  2. Intermediate precedence

    `|'
          "Bitwise Inclusive Or".

    `&'
          "Bitwise And".

    `^'
          "Bitwise Exclusive Or".

    `!'
          "Bitwise Or Not".

  3. Lowest Precedence

    `+'
          "Addition".  If either argument is absolute, the result has
          the section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

    `-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the *offsets* in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

Assembler Directives
********************

   All assembler directives have names that begin with a period (`.').
The rest of the name is letters, usually in lower case.

   This chapter discusses directives that are available regardless of
the target machine configuration for the GNU assembler.
