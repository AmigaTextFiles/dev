This files are here in gcc:os-include/inline, rather than in just
gcc:include/inline, because they are apparently mechanically derived
from the Commodore proprietary fd files, and as such, may be a
derivative work as defined under copyright law.  So I'm taking
the safe route and including them with the other CBM proprietary
files.
