@{b}   NAME@{ub}
	AddAppIconA - add an icon to workbench's list of appicons.       (V36)

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
	AppIcon = AddAppIconA(id, userdata, text, msgport,
	   D0		      D0     D1      A0     A1

					lock, diskobj, taglist)
					 A2      A3      A4

	struct AppIcon *AddAppIconA(ULONG, ULONG, char *,
		struct MsgPort *, struct FileLock *, struct DiskObject *,
		struct TagItem *);

	Alternate, varargs version:
	struct AppIcon *AddAppIcon(ULONG, ULONG, char *,
			struct MsgPort *, struct FileLock *,
			struct DiskObject *,
			tag1, data1,
			tag2, data2,
			...
			TAG_END );

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	Attempt to add an icon to workbench's list of appicons.  If
	successful, the icon is displayed on the workbench (the same
	place disk icons are displayed).
	This call is provided to allow applications to be notified when
	a graphical object (non neccessarely associated with a file)
	gets 'manipulated'. (explained later).
	The notification consists of an AppMessage (found in workbench.h/i)
	of type 'MTYPE_APPICON' arriving at the message port you specified.
	The types of 'manipulation' that can occur are:
	1. Double-clicking on the icon.  am_NumArgs will be zero and
	   am_ArgList will be NULL.
	2. Dropping an icon or icons on your appicon.  am_NumArgs will
          be the number of icons dropped on your app icon plus one.
          am_ArgList will be an array of ptrs to WBArg structures.
          Refer to the 'WBStartup Message' section of the RKM for more info.
	3. Dropping your appicon on another icon.  NOT SUPPORTED.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	id - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by
	     workbench.  Typical uses in C are in switch and case statements,
	     and in assembly language table lookup.
	userdata - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored
		   by workbench.
	text - name of icon (char *)
	lock - NULL    (Currently unused)
	msgport - pointer to message port workbench will use to send you an
		  AppMessage message of type 'MTYPE_APPICON' when your icon
		  gets 'manipulated' (explained above).
	diskobj - pointer to a DiskObject structure filled in as follows:
	    do_Magic - NULL
	    do_Version - NULL
	    do_Gadget - a gadget structure filled in as follows:
		NextGadget - NULL
		LeftEdge - NULL
		TopEdge - NULL
		Width - width of icon hit-box
		Height - height of icon hit-box
		Flags - NULL or GADGHIMAGE
		Activation - NULL
		GadgetType - NULL
		GadgetRender - pointer to Image structure filled in as follows:
		    LeftEdge - NULL
		    TopEdge - NULL
		    Width - width of image (must be <= Width of hit box)
		    Height - height of image (must be <= Height of hit box)
		    Depth - # of bit-planes in image
		    ImageData - pointer to actual word aligned bits (CHIP MEM)
		    PlanePick - Plane mask ((1 << depth) - 1)
		    PlaneOnOff - 0
		    NextImage - NULL
		SelectRender - pointer to alternate Image struct or NULL
		GadgetText - NULL
		MutualExclude - NULL
		SpecialInfo - NULL
		GadgetID - NULL

	    do_DrawerData - NULL
	    do_ToolWindow - NULL
	    do_StackSize - NULL

	(an easy way to create one of these (a DiskObject) is to create an icon
        with the V2.0 icon editor and save it out.  Your application can then
        call @{"GetDiskObject" Link "icon/GetDiskObject()"} on it and pass that to AddAppIcon.)

	taglist - ptr to a list of tag items.  Must be NULL for V2.0.

@{b}   RESULTS@{ub}
	AppIcon - a pointer to an appicon structure which you pass to
		  @{"RemoveAppIcon" Link "wb/RemoveAppIcon()"} when you want to remove the icon
		  from workbench's list of appicons.  NULL
		  if workbench was unable to add your icon; typically
		  happens when workbench is not running or under low
		  memory conditions.

@{b}   EXAMPLE@{ub}
	You could design a print-spooler icon and add it to the workbench.
	Any file dropped on the print spooler would be printed.  If the
	user double-clicked (opened) your printer-spooler icon, you could
	open a window showing the status of the print spool, allow changes
	to print priorities, allow deletions, etc.  If you registered this
	window as an 'appwindow' (explained in workbench.library AddAppWindow)
	files could also be dropped in the window and added to the spool.

@{b}   BUGS@{ub}
	Currently @{"Info" Link "dos/Info()"} cannot be obtained on appicons.

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	Attempt to add the window to workbench's list of appwindows.
	Normally non-workbench windows (those not opened by workbench)
	cannot have icons dropped in them.  This call is provided to
	allow applications to be notified when an icon or icons get
	dropped inside a window that they have registered with workbench.
	The notification consists of an AppMessage (found in workbench.h/i)
	of type 'MTYPE_APPWINDOW' arriving at the message port you specified.
	What you do with the list of icons (pointed to by am_ArgList) is
	up to you, but generally you would want to call @{"GetDiskObjectNew" Link "icon/GetDiskObjectNew()"} on
	them.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	id - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored by

	     and in assembly language table lookup.
	userdata - this variable is strictly for your own use and is ignored
		   by workbench.
	window - pointer to window to add.
	msgport - pointer to message port workbench will use to send you an
		  AppMessage message of type 'MTYPE_APPWINDOW' when your
		  window gets an icon or icons dropped in it.
	taglist - ptr to a list of tag items.  Must be NULL for V2.0.

@{b}   RESULTS@{ub}
	AppWindow - a pointer to an appwindow structure which you pass to

@{b}   NOTES@{ub}
       The V2.0 icon editor is an example of an app window.  Note that app
       window applications generally want to call @{"GetDiskObjectNew" Link "icon/GetDiskObjectNew()"}
       (as opposed to GetDiskObject) to get the disk object for the icon
       dropped in the window.
