@{b}   NAME@{ub}
	AvailFonts -- Inquire available memory & disk fonts.

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
	error = AvailFonts(buffer, bufBytes, flags);
	                   A0      D0        D1

	LONG AvailFonts( struct AvailFontsHeader *buffer, LONG bufBytes
		ULONG flags );

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	AvailFonts fills a user supplied buffer with the structure,
	described below, that contains information about all the
	fonts available in memory and/or on disk.  Those fonts
	available on disk need to be loaded into memory and opened
	via @{"OpenDiskFont" Link "diskfont/OpenDiskFont()"}, those already in memory are accessed via
	@{"OpenFont" Link "graphics/OpenFont()"}.  The TextAttr structure required by the open calls
	is part of the information AvailFonts supplies.

	When AvailFonts fails, it returns the number of extra bytes
	it needed to complete the command.  Add this number to your
	current buffer size, allocate a new buffer, and try again.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	buffer - memory to be filled with struct AvailFontsHeader
		followed by an array of AvailFonts elements, which
		contains entries for the available fonts and their
		names.

	bufBytes - the number of bytes in the buffer
	flags - AFF_MEMORY is set to search memory for fonts to fill
		the structure, AFF_DISK is set to search the disk for
		fonts to fill the structure.  AFF_SCALED is set to
		not filter out memory fonts that are not designed.
		AFF_BITMAP is set to filter out fonts that are not
		stored in Amiga font format, i.e. to filter out
		outline fonts.  Any combination may be specified.
		AFF_TAGGED is set to fill the buffer with TAvailFonts
		elements instead of AvailFonts elements.

@{b}   RESULTS@{ub}
	buffer - filled with struct AvailFontsHeader followed by the
		[T]AvailFonts elements, There will be duplicate entries
		for fonts found both in memory and on disk, differing
		only by type.  The existance of a disk font in the
		buffer indicates that it exists as an entry in a font
		contents file -- the underlying font file has not been
		checked for validity, thus an @{"OpenDiskFont" Link "diskfont/OpenDiskFont()"} of it may
		fail.
	error - if non-zero, this indicates the number of bytes needed
		for AvailFonts in addition to those supplied.  Thus
		structure elements were not returned because of
		insufficient bufBytes.

@{b}   EXAMPLE@{ub}
	int afShortage, afSize;
	struct AvailFontsHeader *afh;

	...

	afSize = 400;
	do {
	    afh = (struct AvailFontsHeader *) AllocMem(afSize, 0);
	    if (afh) {
	        afShortage = AvailFonts(afh, afSize, AFF_MEMORY|AFF_DISK);
	        if (afShortage) {
	            FreeMem(afh, afSize);
	            afSize += afShortage;
	        }
	    }
	    else {
	        fail("AllocMem of AvailFonts buffer afh failed\n");
	        break;
	    }
	}
	    while (afShortage);

	/*
	 * if (afh) non-zero here, then:
	 * 1. it points to a valid AvailFontsHeader
	 * 2. it must have FreeMem(afh, afSize) called for it after use

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	This function creates a new array of FontContents entries

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	fontsLock - a DOS lock on the FONTS: directory (or other
	    directory where the font contents file and associated
	    font directory resides).
	fontName - the font name, with the ".font" suffix, which
	    is also the name of the font contents file.

@{b}   EXCEPTIONS@{ub}
	This command was first made available as of version 34.

	D0 is zero if the fontName is does not have a ".font" suffix,

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	srcFont - the font from which the scaled font is to be
	    constructed.
	destTextAttr - the desired attributes for the new scaled
	    font.  This may be a structure of type TextAttr or
	    TTextAttr.

@{b}   RESULT@{ub}
	header - a pointer to a DiskFontHeader structure.  This is not
		being managed by the diskfont.library, however.

@{b}   NOTES@{ub}
	o   This function may use the blitter.
	o   Fonts containing characters that render wholly outside
	    the character advance cell are currently not scalable.
	o   The font, and memory allocated for the scaled font can
	    can be freed by calling @{"StripFont()" Link "graphics/StripFont()"} on the font,
	    and then calling @{"UnLoadSeg()" Link "dos/UnLoadSeg()"} on the segment created
	    by this function.

	    Both the TextFont structure, and segment pointer are contained
	    within the DiskFontHeader struct.  The DiskFontHeader structure
	    will also be freed as part of the @{"UnLoadSeg()" Link "dos/UnLoadSeg()"} call.
	    @{"StripFont()" Link "graphics/StripFont()"} is a new graphics.library call as of V36.

@Node "OpenDiskFont()" "diskfont.library/OpenDiskFont"

@{b}   NAME@{ub}
       OpenDiskFont - load and get a pointer to a disk font.

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       font = OpenDiskFont(textAttr)
       D0                  A0

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
       This function finds the font with the specified textAttr on
       disk, loads it into memory, and returns a pointer to the font
       that can be used in subsequent @{"SetFont" Link "graphics/SetFont()"} and @{"CloseFont" Link "graphics/CloseFont()"} calls.
       It is important to match this call with a corresponding
       @{"CloseFont" Link "graphics/CloseFont()"} call for effective management of font memory.

       If the font is already in memory, the copy in memory is used.
       The disk copy is not reloaded.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
       textAttr - a TextAttr structure that describes the text font
               attributes desired.

@{b}   RESULTS@{ub}
       D0 is zero if the desired font cannot be found.

@{b}   NOTES@{ub}
       As of V36, OpenDiskFont() will automatically attempt to
       construct a font for you if:

               You have requested a font size which does not exist
               as a designed font, and

               You have not set the DESIGNED bit in the ta_Flags
               field of the TextAttr, or TTextAttr struct.

       Constructed fonts are created by scaling a designed font.
       A designed font is one which typically resides on disk,
       or in ROM (e.g., a font which has been designed by hand
       using a drawing tool).  Designed fonts generally look better
       than fonts constructed by the font scaler, but designed
       fonts also require disk space for each font size.

       Always set the DESIGNED bit if you do not want constructed fonts,
       or use @{"AvailFonts()" Link "AvailFonts()"} to find out which font sizes already exist.
       
       As of V37 the diskfont.library supported built-in outline
       fonts.  Then in V38 the outline font engine was moved to
       a new library, "bullet.library."

@{b}   BUGS@{ub}
       This routine will not work well with font names whose file
       name components are longer than the maximum allowed
       (30 characters).
