@{b}   NAME@{ub}
	CreatePlayerA -- create a player and link it to a conductor. (V37)
	CreatePlayer -- varargs stub for CreatePlayerA(). (V37)

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
	player = CreatePlayerA(tagList);
	D0                     A0

	struct Player *CreatePlayerA(struct TagItem *);

	player = CreatePlayer(firstTag, ...);

	struct Player *CreatePlayer(Tag, ...);

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
	Creates a player structure with the desired attributes.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
	tagList - pointer to an array of tags providing optional extra
		  parameters, or NULL

@{b}   TAGS@{ub}
	PLAYER_Name (STRPTR) - name of the player (generally the
			application's name). Default is no name. (V37)

	PLAYER_Hook (struct Hook *) - function to call when time changes
			occur. Default is no function. The Hook is called
			with:

				A0 - address of Hook structure
				A1 - message, currently pmTime or pmState
		                A2 - address of Player structure

			Note that your hook function is not necessarily called
			TICK_FREQ times per second. This is the maximum number
			of times it can be called. (V37)

	PLAYER_Priority (BYTE) - priority for the player, from -128 to +127.
			Default is 0. (V37)

	PLAYER_Conductor (STRPTR) - name of the conductor to link with. If
			this conductor doesn't exist, it is created
			automatically. If ~0 is passed, creates a private
			conductor. (V37)

	PLAYER_Ready (BOOL) - set/clear the "ready" flag. Default is FALSE.
			(V37)

	PLAYER_AlarmTime (LONG) - sets this player's alarm time, and the
			PLAYERF_ALARMSET flag. (V37)

	PLAYER_Alarm (BOOL) - if TRUE sets the PLAYERF_ALARMSET flag, FALSE
			clears the flag. Default is FALSE. (V37)

	PLAYER_AlarmSigTask (struct Task *) - task to signal on notify or
			alarm. Default is no task. Having no task automatically
			forces the PLAYERF_ALARMSET flag off. (V37)

	PLAYER_AlarmSigBit (BYTE) - signal bit to use on alarm or -1 to
			disable. Default is -1. Having a signal bit of -1
			automatically forces the PLAYERF_ALARMSET flag
			off. (V37)

	PLAYER_Quiet (BOOL) - when TRUE, this player is ignored. Mainly
			used by external sync applications. Default is FALSE.
			(V37)

	PLAYER_UserData (VOID *) - sets the player's UserData value.
			Default is NULL. (V37)

	PLAYER_ID (UWORD) - sets the player's ID value. Default is 0. (V37)

	PLAYER_Conducted (BOOL) - if TRUE sets the PLAYERF_CONDUCTED flag,
			FALSE clears the flag. Default is FALSE. (V37)

	PLAYER_ExtSync (BOOL) - if TRUE, attempts to become external sync
			source. (V37)

	PLAYER_ErrorCode (LONG *) - optional pointer to a longword which
			will receive an error code whenever this function
			fails. Possible error values currently include:
			  RTE_NOMEMORY - memory allocation failed
			  RTE_NOTIMER  - timer (CIA) allocation failed

@{b}   RESULTS@{ub}
	player - a pointer to a Player structure on success or NULL on
		 failure. When NULL is returned, an error code can be returned
		 in the longword variable pointed to by the optional
		 PLAYER_ErrorCode tag.
