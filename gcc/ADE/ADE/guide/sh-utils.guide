Introduction
************

   First of all, this manual is incomplete.  The @{b}stty@{ub} section, in
particular, needs substantial reorganization and additional explanatory
text before it will be up to the standard of other GNU manuals.
Explanatory text in general is lacking; the manual presently assumes you
pretty much know what to do, and just need to be reminded of how.  Thus,
if you are interested, please get involved in improving this manual.
The entire GNU community will benefit.

   Some of these programs are useful only when writing shell scripts;
utilities like these are, in fact, the "language" of shell scripts (to
a great extent).  Others are occasionally useful interactively.

   The GNU shell utilities are mostly compatible with the POSIX.2
standard.

   Please report bugs to @{b}sh-utils-bugs@gnu.ai.mit.edu@{ub}.  Remember to
include the version number, machine architecture, input files, and any
other information needed to reproduce the bug: your input, what you
expected, what you got, and why it is wrong.  Diffs are welcome, but
please include a description of the problem as well, since this is
sometimes difficult to infer. See @{"Bugs" link "gcc.guide/Bugs"}.

   This manual is based on the Unix man pages in the distribution, which
were originally written by David MacKenzie and updated by Jim Meyering.
Franc,ois Pinard did the initial conversion to Texinfo format.  Karl
Berry did the indexing, some reorganization, and editing of the results.
Richard Stallman contributed his usual invaluable insights to the
overall process.

Common options
**************

   Certain options are available in all these programs.  Rather than
writing identical descriptions for each of the programs, they are
described here.  (In fact, every GNU program accepts (or should accept)
these options.)

   Many of these programs take arbitrary strings as arguments.  In those
cases, @{b}--help@{ub} and @{b}--version@{ub} are taken as these options only if there is
one and exactly one command line argument.

@{b}--help@{ub}
     Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit
     successfully.

@{b}--version@{ub}
     Print the version number, then exit successfully.

Date input formats
******************

     Our units of temporal measurement, from seconds on up to months,
     are so complicated, asymmetrical and disjunctive so as to make
     coherent mental reckoning in time all but impossible.  Indeed, had
     some tyrannical god contrived to enslave our minds to time, to
     make it all but impossible for us to escape subjection to sodden
     routines and unpleasant surprises, he could hardly have done
     better than handing down our present system.  It is like a set of
     trapezoidal building blocks, with no vertical or horizontal
     surfaces, like a language in which the simplest thought demands
     ornate constructions, useless particles and lengthy
     circumlocutions.  Unlike the more successful patterns of language
     and science, which enable us to face experience boldly or at least
     level-headedly, our system of temporal calculation silently and
     persistently encourages our terror of time.

     ...  It is as though architects had to measure length in feet,
     width in meters and height in ells; as though basic instruction
     manuals demanded a knowledge of five different languages.  It is
     no wonder then that we often look into our own immediate past or
     future, last Tuesday or a week from Sunday, with feelings of
     helpless confusion.  ...

     -- Robert Grudin, `Time and the Art of Living'.

   This section describes the textual date representations that GNU
programs accept.  These are the strings you, as a user, can supply as
arguments to the various programs.  The C interface (via the @{b}getdate@{ub}
function) is not described here.

   Although the date syntax here can represent any possible time since
zero A.D., computer integers are not big enough for such a
(comparatively) long time.  The earliest date semantically allowed on
Unix systems is midnight, 1 January 1970 UCT.

General date syntax
===================

   A @{i}date@{ui} is a string, possibly empty, containing many items separated
by whitespace.  The whitespace may be omitted when no ambiguity arises.
The empty string means the beginning of today (i.e., midnight).  Order
of the items is immaterial.  A date string may contain many flavors of
items:

   * calendar date items

   * time of the day items

   * time zone items

   * day of the week items

   * relative items

   * pure numbers.

We describe each of these item types in turn, below.

   A few numbers may be written out in words in most contexts.  This is
most useful for specifying day of the week items or relative items (see
below).  Here is the list: @{b}first@{ub} for 1, @{b}next@{ub} for 2, @{b}third@{ub} for 3, @{b}fourth@{ub}
for 4, @{b}fifth@{ub} for 5, @{b}sixth@{ub} for 6, @{b}seventh@{ub} for 7, @{b}eighth@{ub} for 8, @{b}ninth@{ub} for
9, @{b}tenth@{ub} for 10, @{b}eleventh@{ub} for 11 and @{b}twelfth@{ub} for 12.  Also, @{b}last@{ub} means
exactly -1.

   When a month is written this way, it is still considered to be
written numerically, instead of being "spelled in full"; this changes
the allowed strings.

   Alphabetic case is completely ignored in dates.  Comments may be
introduced between round parentheses, as long as included parentheses
are properly nested.  Hyphens not followed by a digit are currently
ignored.  Leading zeros on numbers are ignored.

Calendar date item
==================

   A @{i}calendar date item@{ui} specifies a day of the year.  It is specified
differently, depending on whether the month is specified numerically or
literally.  All these strings specify the same calendar date:

     1970-09-17           # ISO 8601.
     70-9-17              # This century assumed by default.
     70-09-17             # Leading zeros are ignored.
     9/17/72              # Common U.S. writing.
     24 September 1972
     24 Sept 72           # September has a special abbreviation.
     24 Sep 72            # Three-letter abbreviations always allowed.
     Sep 24, 1972
     24-sep-72
     24sep72

   The year can also be omitted.  In this case, the last specified year
is used, or the current year if none.  For example:

     9/17
     sep 17

   Here are the rules.

   For numeric months, the ISO 8601 format @{b}YEAR-MONTH-DAY@{ub} is allowed,
where YEAR is any positive number, MONTH is a number between 01 and 12,
and DAY is a number between 01 and 31.  A leading zero must be present
if a number is less than ten.  If YEAR is less than 100, then 1900 is
added to it to force a date in this century.  The construct
@{b}MONTH/DAY/YEAR@{ub}, popular in the United States, is accepted.  Also
@{b}MONTH/DAY@{ub}, omitting the year.

   Literal months may be spelled out in full: @{b}January@{ub}, @{b}February@{ub}, @{b}March@{ub},
@{b}April@{ub}, @{b}May@{ub}, @{b}June@{ub}, @{b}July@{ub}, @{b}August@{ub}, @{b}September@{ub}, @{b}October@{ub}, @{b}November@{ub} or
@{b}December@{ub}.  Literal months may be abbreviated to their first three
letters, possibly followed by an abbreviating dot.  It is also
permitted to write @{b}Sept@{ub} instead of @{b}September@{ub}.

   When months are written literally, the calendar date may be given as
any of the following:

     DAY MONTH YEAR
     DAY MONTH
     MONTH DAY YEAR
     DAY-MONTH-YEAR

   Or, omitting the year:

     MONTH DAY


@endnode

@node "Time of day item" "sh-utils.guide/Time of day item"
@next "Timezone item"
@prev "Calendar date item"
@toc "Date input formats"

Time of day item
================

   A @{i}time of day item@{ui} in date strings specifies the time on a given
day.  Here are some examples, all of which represent the same time:

     20:02:0
     20:02
     8:02pm
     20:02-0500      # In EST (Eastern U.S. Standard Time).

   More generally, the time of the day may be given as
@{b}HOUR:MINUTE:SECOND@{ub}, where HOUR is a number between 0 and 23, MINUTE is
a number between 0 and 59, and SECOND is a number between 0 and 59.
Alternatively, @{b}:SECOND@{ub} can be omitted, in which case it is taken to be
zero.

   If the time is followed by @{b}am@{ub} or @{b}pm@{ub} (or @{b}a.m.@{ub} or @{b}p.m.@{ub}), HOUR is
restricted to run from 1 to 12, and @{b}:MINUTE@{ub} may be omitted (taken to be
zero).  @{b}am@{ub} indicates the first half of the day, @{b}pm@{ub} indicates the second
half of the day.  In this notation, 12 is the predecessor of 1:
midnight is @{b}12am@{ub} while noon is @{b}12pm@{ub}.

   The time may alternatively be followed by a timezone correction,
expressed as @{b}SHHMM@{ub}, where S is @{b}+@{ub} or @{b}-@{ub}, HH is a number of zone hours and
MM is a number of zone minutes.  When a timezone correction is given
this way, it forces interpretation of the time in UTC, overriding any
previous specification for the timezone or the local timezone.  The
MINUTE part of the time of the day may not be elided when a timezone
correction is used.  This is the only way to specify a timezone
correction by fractional parts of an hour.

   Either @{b}am@{ub}/@{b}pm@{ub} or a timezone correction may be specified, but not both.

Timezone item
=============

   A @{i}timezone item@{ui} specifies an international timezone, indicated by a
small set of letters.  Any included period is ignored.  Military
timezone designations use a single letter.  Currently, only integral
zone hours may be represented in a timezone item.  See the previous
section for a finer control over the timezone correction.

zone hour value.

Day of week item
================

   The explicit mention of a day of the week will forward the date
(only if necessary) to reach that day of the week in the future.

   Days of the week may be spelled out in full: @{b}Sunday@{ub}, @{b}Monday@{ub},
@{b}Tuesday@{ub}, @{b}Wednesday@{ub}, @{b}Thursday@{ub}, @{b}Friday@{ub} or @{b}Saturday@{ub}.  Days may be
abbreviated to their first three letters, optionally followed by a
period.  The special abbreviations @{b}Tues@{ub} for @{b}Tuesday@{ub}, @{b}Wednes@{ub} for
@{b}Wednesday@{ub} and @{b}Thur@{ub} or @{b}Thurs@{ub} for @{b}Thursday@{ub} are also allowed.

   A number may precede a day of the week item to move forward
supplementary weeks.  It is best used in expression like @{b}third monday@{ub}.
In this context, @{b}last DAY@{ub} or @{b}next DAY@{ub} is also acceptable; they move one
week before or after the day that DAY by itself would represent.

   A comma following a day of the week item is ignored.

@toc "Date input formats"

Relative item in date strings
=============================

@{i}   Relative items@{ui} adjust a date (or the current date if none) forward
or backward.  The effects of relative items accumulate.  Here are some
examples:

     1 year
     1 year ago
     3 years
     2 days

   The unit of time displacement may be selected by the string @{b}year@{ub} or
@{b}month@{ub} for moving by whole years or months.  These are fuzzy units, as
years and months are not all of equal duration.  More precise units are
@{b}fortnight@{ub} which is worth 14 days, @{b}week@{ub} worth 7 days, @{b}day@{ub} worth 24
hours, @{b}hour@{ub} worth 60 minutes, @{b}minute@{ub} or @{b}min@{ub} worth 60 seconds, and
@{b}second@{ub} or @{b}sec@{ub} worth one second.  An @{b}s@{ub} suffix on these units is accepted
and ignored.

   The unit of time may be preceded by a multiplier, given as an
optionally signed number.  Unsigned numbers are taken as positively
signed.  No number at all implies 1 for a multiplier.  Following a
relative item by the string @{b}ago@{ub} is equivalent to preceding the unit by a
multiplicator with value -1.

   The string @{b}tomorrow@{ub} is worth one day in the future (equivalent to
@{b}day@{ub}), the string @{b}yesterday@{ub} is worth one day in the past (equivalent to
@{b}day ago@{ub}).

   The strings @{b}now@{ub} or @{b}today@{ub} are relative items corresponding to
zero-valued time displacement, these strings come from the fact a
zero-valued time displacement represents the current time when not
otherwise change by previous items.  They may be used to stress other
items, like in @{b}12:00 today@{ub}.  The string @{b}this@{ub} also has the meaning of a
zero-valued time displacement, but is preferred in date strings like
@{b}this thursday@{ub}.

   When a relative item makes the resulting date to cross the boundary
between DST and non-DST (or vice-versa), the hour is adjusted according
to the local time.

Pure numbers in date strings
============================

   The precise intepretation of a pure decimal number is dependent of
the context in the date string.

   If the decimal number is of the form YYYYMMDD and no other calendar
date item (see @{"Calendar date item" link "Calendar date item"}) appears before it in the date
string, then YYYY is read as the year, MM as the month number and DD as
the day of the month, for the specified calendar date.

   If the decimal number is of the form HHMM and no other time of day
item appears before it in the date string, then HH is read as the hour
of the day and MM as the minute of the hour, for the specified time of
the day.  MM can also be omitted.

   If both a calendar date and a time of day appear to the left of a
number in the date string, but no relative item, then the number
overrides the year.

Authors of @{b}getdate@{ub}
==================

@{b}   getdate@{ub} was originally implemented by Steven M. Bellovin

Printing text
*************

   This section describes commands that display text strings.


 @{" echo invocation            " link "echo invocation"}  Print a line of text.
 @{" printf invocation          " link "printf invocation"}  Format and print data.
 @{" yes invocation             " link "yes invocation"}  Print a string until interrupted.

@{b}echo@{ub}: Print a line of text
==========================

@{b}   echo@{ub} writes each given STRING to standard output, with a space
between each and a newline after the last one.  Synopsis:

     echo [OPTION]... [STRING]...

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-n@{ub}
     Do not output the trailing newline.

@{b}-e@{ub}
     Enable interpretation of the following backslash-escaped
     characters in each STRING:

    @{b}\\a@{ub}
          alert (bell)

    @{b}\\b@{ub}
          backspace

    @{b}\\c@{ub}
          suppress trailing newline

    @{b}\\f@{ub}
          form feed

    @{b}\\n@{ub}
          new line

    @{b}\\r@{ub}
          carriage return

    @{b}\\t@{ub}
          horizontal tab

    @{b}\\v@{ub}
          vertical tab

    @{b}\\\\ @{ub}
          backslash

    @{b}\\NNN@{ub}
          the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal); if NNN is not
          a valid octal number, it is printed literally.

@toc "Printing text"

@{b}printf@{ub}: Format and print data
=============================

@{b}   printf@{ub} does formatted printing of text. Synopsis:

     printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...

@{b}   printf@{ub} prints the FORMAT string, interpreting @{b}%@{ub} directives and @{b}\\ @{ub}
escapes in the same way as the C @{b}printf@{ub} function.  The FORMAT argument
is re-used as necessary to convert all of the given ARGUMENTs.

@{b}   printf@{ub} has one additional directive, @{b}%b@{ub}, which prints its argument
string with @{b}\\ @{ub} escapes interpreted in the same way as in the FORMAT
string.

@{b}   printf@{ub} interprets @{b}\\0ooo@{ub} in FORMAT as an octal number (if OOO is 0
to 3 octal digits) specifying a character to print, and @{b}\\xhhh@{ub} as a
hexadecimal number (if HHH is 1 to 3 hex digits) specifying a character
to print.

   An additional escape, @{b}\\c@{ub}, causes @{b}printf@{ub} to produce no further
output.

   The only options are a lone @{b}--help@{ub} or @{b}--version@{ub}.  See
@{"Common options" link "Common options"}.


@endnode

@node "yes invocation" "sh-utils.guide/yes invocation"

@{b}yes@{ub}: Print a string until interrupted
=====================================

@{b}   yes@{ub} prints the command line arguments, separated by spaces and
followed by a newline, forever until it is killed.  If no arguments are
given, it prints @{b}y@{ub} followed by a newline forever until killed.

   The only options are a lone @{b}--help@{ub} or @{b}--version@{ub}.  See
@{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

Conditions
**********

   This section describes commands that are primarily useful for their
exit status, rather than their output.  Thus, they are often used as the
condition of shell @{b}if@{ub} statements, or as the last command in a pipeline.


 @{" false invocation           " link "false invocation"}  Do nothing, unsuccessfully.
 @{" true invocation            " link "true invocation"}  Do nothing, successfully.
 @{" test invocation            " link "test invocation"}  Check file types and compare values.
 @{" expr invocation            " link "expr invocation"}  Evaluate expressions.


@endnode

@node "false invocation" "sh-utils.guide/false invocation"
@next "true invocation"
@toc "Conditions"

@{b}false@{ub}: Do nothing, unsuccessfully
=================================

@{b}   false@{ub} does nothing except return an exit status of 1, meaning
@{i}failure@{ui}.  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where an
unsuccessful command is needed.

   Any arguments are ignored, except for a lone @{b}--help@{ub} or @{b}--version@{ub}
(see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}).


@endnode

@node "true invocation" "sh-utils.guide/true invocation"
@next "test invocation"
@prev "false invocation"
@toc "Conditions"

@{b}true@{ub}: Do nothing, successfully
==============================

@{b}   true@{ub} does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning
@{i}success@{ui}.  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a
successful command is needed, although the shell built-in command @{b}:@{ub}
(colon) may be faster.

   Any arguments are ignored, except for a lone @{b}--help@{ub} or @{b}--version@{ub}
(see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}).

@node "test invocation" "sh-utils.guide/test invocation"

@{b}test@{ub}: Check file types and compare values
=========================================

@{b}   test@{ub} returns a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the
evaluation of the conditional expression EXPR.  Each part of the
expression must be a separate argument.

@{b}   test@{ub} has file status checks, string operators, and numeric
comparison operators.

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   Besides the options below, @{b}test@{ub} accepts a lone @{b}--help@{ub} or @{b}--version@{ub}.
See @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.  A single non-option argument is also allowed:
@{b}test@{ub} returns true if the argument is not null.

     True if FILE exists.

@{b}-s FILE@{ub}
     True if FILE exists and has a size greater than zero.

@{b}FILE1 -nt FILE2@{ub}

@{b}FILE1 -ot FILE2@{ub}
     True if FILE1 is older (according to modification date) than FILE2.

@{b}FILE1 -ef FILE2@{ub}
     True if FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and inode numbers,

String tests
------------

   These options test string characteristics.  Strings are not quoted
for @{b}test@{ub}, though you may need to quote them to protect characters with
special meaning to the shell, e.g., spaces.

@{b}-z STRING@{ub}
     True if the length of STRING is zero.

@{b}-n STRING@{ub}
@{b}STRING@{ub}
     True if the length of STRING is nonzero.

@{b}STRING1 = STRING2@{ub}
     True if the strings are equal.

     True if the strings are not equal.


@endnode

@node "Numeric tests" "sh-utils.guide/Numeric tests"
@next "Connectives for test"
@prev "String tests"
@toc "test invocation"

Numeric tests
-------------

   Numeric relationals.  The arguments must be entirely numeric
(possibly negative), or the special expression @{b}-l STRING@{ub}, which
evaluates to the length of STRING.

@{b}ARG1 -eq ARG2@{ub}
@{b}ARG1 -ne ARG2@{ub}
@{b}ARG1 -lt ARG2@{ub}
@{b}ARG1 -le ARG2@{ub}
@{b}ARG1 -gt ARG2@{ub}
@{b}ARG1 -ge ARG2@{ub}
     These arithmetic binary operators return true if ARG1 is equal,
     not-equal, less-than, less-than-or-equal, greater-than, or
     greater-than-or-equal than ARG2, respectively.

   For example:

     test -1 -gt -2 && echo yes
     => yes
     test -l abc -gt 1 && echo yes
     => yes
     test 0x100 -eq 1
     error--> test: integer expression expected before -eq


@endnode

@node "Connectives for test" "sh-utils.guide/Connectives for test"
@prev "Numeric tests"
@toc "test invocation"

Connectives for @{b}test@{ub}
--------------------

   The usual logical connectives.

@{b}! EXPR@{ub}
     True if EXPR is false.

@{b}EXPR1 -a EXPR2@{ub}
     True if both EXPR1 and EXPR2 are true.

@{b}EXPR1 -o EXPR2@{ub}
     True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 is true.


@endnode

@node "expr invocation" "sh-utils.guide/expr invocation"
@prev "test invocation"
@toc "Conditions"

@{b}expr@{ub}: Evaluate expressions
==========================

@{b}   expr@{ub} evaluates an expression and writes the result on standard
output.  Each token of the expression must be a separate argument.

   Operands are either numbers or strings.  @{b}expr@{ub} coerces anything
appearing in an operand position to an integer or a string depending on
the operation being applied to it.

   Strings are not quoted for @{b}expr@{ub} itself, though you may need to quote
them to protect characters with special meaning to the shell, e.g.,
spaces.

   Operators may given as infix symbols or prefix keywords.  Parentheses
may be used for grouping in the usual manner (you must quote parentheses
to avoid the shell evaluating them, however).

   Exit status:

     0 if the expression is neither null nor 0,
     1 if the expression is null or 0,
     2 for invalid expressions.

Relations for @{b}expr@{ub}
------------------

   The usual logical connectives and relations, in order of precedence.

@{b}|@{ub}
     Yields its first argument if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise
     its second argument.

@{b}&@{ub}
     Yields its first argument if neither argument is null or 0,
     otherwise 0.

@{b}< <= = == != >= >@{ub}
     Compare the arguments and return 1 if the relation is true, 0
     otherwise.  @{b}==@{ub} is a synonym for @{b}=@{ub}.  @{b}expr@{ub} first tries to coerce
     both arguments to numbers and do a numeric comparison; if either
     coercion fails, it does a lexicographic comparison.


@endnode

@node "Numeric expressions" "sh-utils.guide/Numeric expressions"
@next "String expressions"
@prev "Relations for expr"
@toc "expr invocation"

Numeric expressions
-------------------

   Numeric operators, in order of increasing precedence.  The
connectives (previous section) have higher precedence, the string
operators (following section) have lower.

@{b}+ -@{ub}
     Addition and subtraction.  Both arguments are coerced to numbers;
     an error occurs if this cannot be done.

@{b}* / %@{ub}
     Multiplication, division, remainder.  Both arguments are coerced to
     numbers; an error occurs if this cannot be done.


@endnode

@node "String expressions" "sh-utils.guide/String expressions"
@next "Examples of expr"
@prev "Numeric expressions"
@toc "expr invocation"

String expressions
------------------

   String operators.  These have lowest precedence.

@{b}STRING : REGEX@{ub}
     Perform pattern matching.  The arguments are coerced to strings
     and the second is considered to be a (basic, a la @{b}grep@{ub}) regular
     expression, with a @{b}^@{ub} implicitly prepended.  The first argument is
     then matched against this regular expression.

     If the match succeeds and REGEX uses @{b}\\(@{ub} and @{b}\\)@{ub}, the @{b}:@{ub} expression
     returns the part of STRING that matched the subexpression;
     otherwise, it returns the number of characters matched.

     If the match fails, the @{b}:@{ub} operator returns the null string if @{b}\\(@{ub}
     and @{b}\\)@{ub} are used in REGEX, otherwise 0.

     Only the first @{b}\\( ... \\)@{ub} pair is relevant to the return value;
     additional pairs are meaningful only for grouping the regular
     expression operators.

     See @{"Regular Expression Library" link "regex.guide/Main"}, for details of regular expression
     syntax.

@{b}match STRING REGEX@{ub}
     An alternative way to do pattern matching.  This is the same as
     @{b}STRING : REGEX@{ub}.

@{b}substr STRING POSITION LENGTH@{ub}
     Returns the substring of STRING beginning at POSITION with length
     at most LENGTH.  If either POSITION or LENGTH is negative or
     non-numeric, returns the null string.

@{b}index STRING CHARACTER-CLASS@{ub}
     Returns the first position in STRING where the first character in
     CHARSET was found.  If no character in CHARSET is found in STRING,
     return 0.

@{b}length STRING@{ub}
     Returns the length of STRING.

   The keywords cannot be used as strings.

Examples of @{b}expr@{ub}
----------------

   Here are a few examples, including quoting for shell metacharacters.

   To add 1 to the shell variable @{b}foo@{ub}, in Bourne-compatible shells:
     foo=`expr $foo + 1`

   To print the non-directory part of the file name stored in @{b}$fname@{ub},
which need not contain a @{b}/@{ub}.
     expr $fname : '.*/\\(^.*\\)' '^|' $fname

     expr abc : 'a\\(.\\)c'

Redirection
***********

   Unix shells commonly provide several forms of @{i}redirection@{ui}--ways to
change the input source or output destination of a command.  But one
useful redirection is performed by a separate command, not by the shell;
it's described here.


 @{" tee invocation             " link "tee invocation"}  Redirect output to multiple files.


@endnode

@node "tee invocation" "sh-utils.guide/tee invocation"
@toc "Redirection"

@{b}tee@{ub}: Redirect output to multiple files
======================================

   The @{b}tee@{ub} command copies standard input to standard output and also to
any files given as arguments.  This is useful when you want not only to
send some data down a pipe, but also to save a copy.  Synopsis:

     tee [OPTION]... [FILE]...

   If a file being written to does not already exist, it is created.
If a file being written to already exists, the data it previously
contained is overwritten unless the @{b}-a@{ub} option is used.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-a@{ub}
@{b}--append@{ub}
     Append standard input to the given files rather than overwriting
     them.

@{b}-i@{ub}
@{b}--ignore-interrupts@{ub}
     Ignore interrupt signals.

**********************

   This section describes commands that manipulate file names.


 @{" basename invocation        " link "basename invocation"}  Strip directory and suffix from a file name.
 @{" dirname invocation         " link "dirname invocation"}  Strip non-directory suffix from a file name.

@{b}basename@{ub}: Strip directory and suffix from a file name
=====================================================

@{b}   basename@{ub} removes any leading directory components from NAME.
Synopsis:

     basename NAME [SUFFIX]

   If SUFFIX is specified and is identical to the end of NAME, it is
removed from NAME as well.  @{b}basename@{ub} prints the result on standard
output.

   The only options are @{b}--help@{ub} and @{b}--version@{ub}.  See @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}dirname@{ub}: Strip non-directory suffix from a file name
====================================================

@{b}   dirname@{ub} prints all but the final slash-delimited component of a
string (presumably a filename).  Synopsis:

     dirname NAME

   If NAME is a single component, @{b}dirname@{ub} prints @{b}.@{ub} (meaning the current
directory).

   The only options are @{b}--help@{ub} and @{b}--version@{ub}.  See @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.


@endnode

@node "pathchk invocation" "sh-utils.guide/pathchk invocation"
@prev "dirname invocation"
@toc "File name manipulation"

@{b}pathchk@{ub}: Check file name portability
====================================

@{b}   pathchk@{ub} checks portability of filenames.  Synopsis:

     pathchk [OPTION]... NAME...

   For each NAME, @{b}pathchk@{ub} prints a message if any of these conditions
is true:
  1. one of the existing directories in NAME does not have search
     (execute) permission,

  2. the length of NAME is larger than its filesystem's maximum file
     name length,

  3. the length of one component of NAME, corresponding to an existing
     directory name, is larger than its filesystem's maximum length for
     a file name component.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-p@{ub}
@{b}--portability@{ub}
     Instead of performing length checks on the underlying filesystem,
     test the length of each file name and its components against the
     POSIX.1 minimum limits for portability.  Also check that the file
     name contains no characters not in the portable file name
     character set.

   Exit status:

     0 if all specified file names passed all of the tests,
     1 otherwise.

so forth.  See also the user-related commands in the next section.


 @{" pwd invocation             " link "pwd invocation"}  Print working directory.
 @{" stty invocation            " link "stty invocation"}  Print or change terminal characteristics.

@{b}pwd@{ub}: Print working directory
============================

@{b}   pwd@{ub} prints the fully resolved name of the current directory.  That
is, all components of the printed name will be actual directory
names--none will be symbolic links.

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   The only options are a lone @{b}--help@{ub} or @{b}--version@{ub}.  See

@{b}stty@{ub}: Print or change terminal characteristics
==============================================

@{b}   stty@{ub} prints or changes terminal characteristics, such as baud rate.
Synopses:

     stty [SETTING]...
     stty [OPTION]

   If given no arguments, @{b}stty@{ub} prints the baud rate, line discipline
number (on systems that support it), and line settings that have been
changed from the values set by @{b}stty sane@{ub}.  Mode reading and setting are
performed on the tty line connected to standard input.

@{b}   stty@{ub} accepts many non-option arguments that change aspects of the
terminal line operation, as described below.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-a@{ub}
@{b}--all@{ub}
     Print all current settings in human-readable form.

@{b}-g@{ub}
@{b}--save@{ub}
     Print all current settings in a form that can be used as an
     argument to another @{b}stty@{ub} command to restore the current settings.

   Many settings can be turned off by preceding them with a @{b}-@{ub}.  Such
arguments are marked below with "May be negated" in their description.
The descriptions themselves refer to the positive case, that is, when
@{i}not@{ui} negated (unless stated otherwise, of course).

   Some settings are not available on all POSIX systems, since they use
extensions.  Such arguments are marked below with "Non-POSIX" in their
description.  On non-POSIX systems, those or other settings also may not
be available, but it's not feasible to document all the variations: just
try it and see.

Special characters
------------------

   The special characters' default values vary from system to system.
They are set with the syntax @{b}name value@{ub}, where the names are listed
below and the value can be given either literally, in hat notation
(@{b}^C@{ub}), or as an integer which may start with @{b}0x@{ub} to indicate hexadecimal,
@{b}0@{ub} to indicate octal, or any other digit to indicate decimal.

   For GNU stty, giving a value of @{b}^-@{ub} or @{b}undef@{ub} disables that special
character.  (This is incompatible with Ultrix @{b}stty@{ub}, which uses  a value
of @{b}u@{ub} to disable a special character.  GNU @{b}stty@{ub} treats a value @{b}u@{ub} like
any other, namely to set that special character to <U>.)

@{b}intr@{ub}
     Send an interrupt signal.

@{b}quit@{ub}
     Send a quit signal.

@{b}erase@{ub}
     Erase the last character typed.

@{b}kill@{ub}
     Erase the current line.

@{b}eof@{ub}
     Send an end of file (terminate the input).

@{b}eol@{ub}
     End the line.

@{b}eol2@{ub}
     Alternate character to end the line.  Non-POSIX.

@{b}swtch@{ub}
     Switch to a different shell layer.  Non-POSIX.

@{b}start@{ub}
     Restart the output after stopping it.

@{b}stop@{ub}
     Stop the output.

@{b}susp@{ub}
     Send a terminal stop signal.

@{b}dsusp@{ub}
     Send a terminal stop signal after flushing the input.  Non-POSIX.

@{b}rprnt@{ub}
     Redraw the current line.  Non-POSIX.

@{b}werase@{ub}

   By default, it prints the real user id, real group id, effective
user id if different from the real user id, effective group id if
different from the real group id, and supplemental group ids.

   Each of these numeric values is preceded by an identifying string and
followed by the corresponding user or group name in parentheses.

=====================================

@{b}   who@{ub} prints information about users who are currently logged on.
Synopsis:

@{b}     who@{ub} [OPTION] [FILE] [am i]

   If given no non-option arguments, @{b}who@{ub} prints the following
information for each user currently logged on: login name, terminal
line, login time, and remote hostname or X display.

   If given one non-option argument, @{b}who@{ub} uses that instead of @{b}/etc/utmp@{ub}
as the name of the file containing the record of users logged on.
@{b}/etc/wtmp@{ub} is commonly given as an argument to @{b}who@{ub} to look at who has
previously logged on.

   If given two non-option arguments, @{b}who@{ub} prints only the entry for the
user running it (determined from its standard input), preceded by the
hostname.  Traditionally, the two arguments given are @{b}am i@{ub}, as in @{b}who
am i@{ub}.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-m@{ub}

Literal directives
------------------

@{b}   date@{ub} directives that produce literal strings.

Padding
-------

   By default, @{b}date@{ub} pads numeric fields with zeroes, so that, for
example, numeric months are always output as two digits. GNU @{b}date@{ub}
recognizes the following numeric modifiers between the @{b}%@{ub} and the
directive.

@{b}-@{ub}
     (hyphen) do not pad the field; useful if the output is intended for
     human consumption.

@{b}_@{ub}
     (underscore) pad the field with spaces; useful if you need a fixed
     number of characters in the output, but zeroes are too distracting.

These are GNU extensions.

   Here is an example illustrating the differences:

     date +%d/%m -d "Feb 1"
     => 01/02
     date +%-d/%-m -d "Feb 1"
     => 1/2
     date +%_d/%_m -d "Feb 1"
     =>  1/ 2

@next "Options for date"
@prev "Padding"
@toc "date invocation"

Setting the time
----------------

   If given an argument that does not start with @{b}+@{ub}, @{b}date@{ub} sets the
system clock to the time and date specified by that argument (as
described below).  You must have appropriate privileges to set the
system clock.  The @{b}--date@{ub} and @{b}--set@{ub} options may not be used with such
an argument.  The @{b}--universal@{ub} option may be used with such an argument
to indicate that the specified time and date are relative to
Coordinated Universal Time rather than to the local time zone.

   The argument must consist entirely of digits, which have the
following meaning:

MM
     month

DD
     day within month

HH
     hour

MM
     minute

CC
     first two digits of year (optional)

YY
     last two digits of year (optional)

SS
     second (optional)

   The @{b}--set@{ub} option also sets the system clock; see the next section.

Options for @{b}date@{ub}
----------------

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-d DATESTR@{ub}
@{b}--date=DATESTR@{ub}
     Display the time and date specified in DATESTR instead of the
     current time and date.  DATESTR can be in almost any common
     format.  It can contain month names, timezones, @{b}am@{ub} and @{b}pm@{ub},
     @{b}yesterday@{ub}, @{b}ago@{ub}, @{b}next@{ub}, etc.  See @{"Date input formats" link "Date input formats"}.

@{b}-f DATEFILE@{ub}
@{b}--file=DATEFILE@{ub}
     Parse each line in DATEFILE as with @{b}-d@{ub} and display the resulting
     time and date.  If DATEFILE is @{b}-@{ub}, use standard input.  This is
     useful when you have many dates to process, because the system
     overhead of starting up the @{b}date@{ub} executable many times can be
     considerable.

@{b}--rfc-822@{ub}
     Display the time and date using the RFC-822-specified format, @{b}%a,
     %_d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z@{ub}.  If @{b}--utc@{ub} is also specified, use @{b}GMT@{ub} in
     place of @{b}%z@{ub}.

@{b}-r FILE@{ub}
@{b}--reference=FILE@{ub}
     Display the time and date reference according to the last
     modification time of FILE, instead of the current time and date.

@{b}-s DATESTR@{ub}
@{b}--set=DATESTR@{ub}
     Set the time and date to DATESTR,  See @{b}-d@{ub} above.

@{b}-u@{ub}
@{b}--utc@{ub}
@{b}--universal@{ub}
     Print or set the time and date in Universal Coordinated Time
     instead of in local (wall clock) time.

Examples of @{b}date@{ub}
----------------

   Here are a few examples.  Also see the documentation for the @{b}-d@{ub}
option in the previous section.

   * To print the date of the day before yesterday:

          date --date='2 days ago'

   * To print the date of the day three months and one day hence:
          date --date='3 months 1 day'

   * To print the day of year of Christmas in the current year:
          date --date='25 Dec' +%j

   * To print the current full month name and the day of the month:
          date '+%B %d'

     But this may not be what you want because for the first nine days
     of the month, the @{b}%d@{ub} expands to a zero-padded two-digit field, for
     example @{b}date -d 1may '+%B %d'@{ub} will print @{b}May 01@{ub}.

   * To print a date without the leading zero for one-digit days of the
     month, you can use the (GNU extension) @{b}-@{ub} modifier to suppress the
     padding altogether.
          date -d=1may '+%B %-d'

   * To print the current date and time in the format required by many
     non-GNU versions of @{b}date@{ub} when setting the system clock:
          date +%m%d%H%M%Y.%S

   * To set the system clock forward by two minutes:
          date --set='+2 minutes'

   * To print the date in the format specified by RFC-822, use @{b}date
     --rfc@{ub}.  I just did and saw this:

@{b}chroot@{ub}: Run a command with a different root directory
=====================================================

@{b}   chroot@{ub} runs a command with a specified root directory.  On many
systems, only the super-user can do this.  Synopses:

     chroot NEWROOT [COMMAND [ARGS]...]
     chroot OPTION

   Ordinarily, filenames are looked up starting at the root of the
directory structure, i.e., @{b}/@{ub}.  @{b}chroot@{ub} changes the root to the directory
NEWROOT (which must exist) and then runs COMMAND with optional ARGS.
If COMMAND is not specified, the default is the value of the @{b}SHELL@{ub}
environment variable or @{b}/bin/sh@{ub} if not set, invoked with the @{b}-i@{ub} option.

   The only options are @{b}--help@{ub} and @{b}--version@{ub}.  See @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.


@endnode

@node "env invocation" "sh-utils.guide/env invocation"
@next "nice invocation"
@prev "chroot invocation"
@toc "Modified command invocation"

@{b}env@{ub}: Run a command in a modified environment
============================================

@{b}   env@{ub} runs a command with a modified environment.  Synopses:

     env [OPTION]... [NAME=VALUE]... [COMMAND [ARGS]...]
     env

   Arguments of the form @{b}VARIABLE=VALUE@{ub} set the environment variable
VARIABLE to value VALUE.  VALUE may be empty (@{b}VARIABLE=@{ub}).  Setting a
variable to an empty value is different from unsetting it.

   The first remaining argument specifies the program name to invoke;
it is searched for according to the @{b}PATH@{ub} environment variable.  Any
remaining arguments are passed as arguments to that program.

   If no command name is specified following the environment
specifications, the resulting environment is printed.  This is like
specifying a command name of @{b}printenv@{ub}.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-u NAME@{ub}
@{b}--unset=NAME@{ub}
     Remove variable NAME from the environment, if it was in the
     environment.

@{b}-@{ub}
@{b}-i@{ub}
@{b}--ignore-environment@{ub}
     Start with an empty environment, ignoring the inherited
     environment.

@{b}nice@{ub}: Run a command with modified scheduling priority
=====================================================

@{b}   nice@{ub} prints or modifies the scheduling priority of a job.  Synopsis:

     nice [OPTION]... [COMMAND [ARG]...]

   If no arguments are given, @{b}nice@{ub} prints the current scheduling
priority, which it inherited.  Otherwise, @{b}nice@{ub} runs the given COMMAND
with its scheduling priority adjusted.  If no ADJUSTMENT is given, the
priority of the command is incremented by 10.  You must have
appropriate privileges to specify a negative adjustment.  The priority
can be adjusted by @{b}nice@{ub} over the range of -20 (the highest priority) to
19 (the lowest).

   Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using
the unadorned command name in a script or interactively may get you
different functionality than that described here.

   The program accepts the following option.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-n ADJUSTMENT@{ub}
@{b}-ADJUSTMENT@{ub}
@{b}--adjustment=ADJUSTMENT@{ub}
     Add ADJUSTMENT instead of 10 to the command's priority.

@toc "Modified command invocation"

@{b}nohup@{ub}: Run a command immune to hangups
======================================

@{b}   nohup@{ub} runs the given COMMAND with hangup signals ignored, so that
the command can continue running in the background after you log out.
Synopsis:

     nohup COMMAND [ARG]...

@{b}   nohup@{ub} increases the scheduling priority of COMMAND by 5, so it has a
slightly smaller change to run.  If standard output is a terminal, it
and standard error are redirected so that they are appended to the file
@{b}nohup.out@{ub}; if that cannot be written to, they are appended to the file
@{b}$HOME/nohup.out@{ub}.  If that cannot be written to, the command is not run.

   If @{b}nohup@{ub} creates either @{b}nohup.out@{ub} or @{b}$HOME/nohup.out@{ub}, it creates it
with no "group" or "other" access permissions.  It does not change the
permissions if the output file already existed.

@{b}   nohup@{ub} does not automatically put the command it runs in the
background; you must do that explicitly, by ending the command line
with an @{b}&@{ub}.

   The only options are @{b}--help@{ub} and @{b}--version@{ub}.  See @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.


@endnode

@node "su invocation" "sh-utils.guide/su invocation"
@prev "nohup invocation"
@toc "Modified command invocation"

@{b}su@{ub}: Run a command with substitute user and group id
===================================================

@{b}   su@{ub} allows one user to temporarily become another user.  It runs a
command (often an interactive shell) with the real and effective user
id, group id, and supplemental groups of a given USER. Synopsis:

     su [OPTION]... [USER [ARG]...]

   If no USER is given, the default is @{b}root@{ub}, the super-user.  The shell
to use is taken from USER's @{b}passwd@{ub} entry, or @{b}/bin/sh@{ub} if none is
specified there.  If USER has a password, @{b}su@{ub} prompts for the password
unless run by a user with effective user id of zero (the super-user).

   By default, @{b}su@{ub} does not change the current directory.  It sets the
environment variables @{b}HOME@{ub} and @{b}SHELL@{ub} from the password entry for USER,
and if USER is not the super-user, sets @{b}USER@{ub} and @{b}LOGNAME@{ub} to USER.  By
default, the shell is not a login shell.

   Any additional ARGs are passed as additional arguments to the shell.

   GNU @{b}su@{ub} does not treat @{b}/bin/sh@{ub} or any other shells specially (e.g.,
by setting @{b}argv[0]@{ub} to @{b}-su@{ub}, passing @{b}-c@{ub} only to certain shells, etc.).

@{b}   su@{ub} can optionally be compiled to use @{b}syslog@{ub} to report failed, and
optionally successful, @{b}su@{ub} attempts.  (If the system supports @{b}syslog@{ub}.)
However, GNU @{b}su@{ub} does not check if the user is a member of the @{b}wheel@{ub}
group; see below.

   The program accepts the following options.  Also see @{"Common options" link "Common options"}.

@{b}-c COMMAND@{ub}
@{b}--command=COMMAND@{ub}
     Pass COMMAND, a single command line to run, to the shell with a @{b}-c@{ub}
     option instead of starting an interactive shell.

@{b}-f@{ub}
@{b}--fast@{ub}
     Pass the @{b}-f@{ub} option to the shell.  This probably only makes sense
     if the shell run is @{b}csh@{ub} or @{b}tcsh@{ub}, for which the @{b}-f@{ub} option prevents
     reading the startup file (@{b}.cshrc@{ub}).  With Bourne-like shells, the
     @{b}-f@{ub} option disables file name pattern expansion (globbing), which
     is not likely to be useful.

@{b}-@{ub}
@{b}-l@{ub}
@{b}--login@{ub}
     Make the shell a login shell.  This means the following.  Unset all
     environment variables except @{b}TERM@{ub}, @{b}HOME@{ub}, and @{b}SHELL@{ub} (which are set
     as described above), and @{b}USER@{ub} and @{b}LOGNAME@{ub} (which are set, even for
     the super-user, as described above), and set @{b}PATH@{ub} to a compiled-in
     default value.  Change to USER's home directory.  Prepend @{b}-@{ub} to the
     shell's name, intended to make it read its login startup file(s).

@{b}-m@{ub}
@{b}-p@{ub}
@{b}--preserve-environment@{ub}
     Do not change the environment variables @{b}HOME@{ub}, @{b}USER@{ub}, @{b}LOGNAME@{ub}, or
     @{b}SHELL@{ub}.  Run the shell given in the environment variable @{b}SHELL@{ub}
     instead of the shell from USER's passwd entry, unless the user
     running @{b}su@{ub} is not the superuser and USER's shell is restricted.  A
     @{i}restricted shell@{ui} is one that is not listed in the file
     @{b}/etc/shells@{ub}, or in a compiled-in list if that file does not exist.
     Parts of what this option does can be overridden by @{b}--login@{ub} and
     @{b}--shell@{ub}.

@{b}-s SHELL@{ub}
@{b}--shell=SHELL@{ub}
     Run SHELL instead of the shell from USER's passwd entry, unless
     the user running @{b}su@{ub} is not the superuser and USER's shell is
     restricted (see @{b}-m@{ub} just above).

Why GNU @{b}su@{ub} does not support the @{b}wheel@{ub} group
===========================================

   (This section is by Richard Stallman.)

   Sometimes a few of the users try to hold total power over all the
rest.  For example, in 1984, a few users at the MIT AI lab decided to
seize power by changing the operator password on the Twenex system and
keeping it secret from everyone else.  (I was able to thwart this coup
and give power back to the users by patching the kernel, but I wouldn't
know how to do that in Unix.)

   However, occasionally the rulers do tell someone.  Under the usual
@{b}su@{ub} mechanism, once someone learns the root password who sympathizes
with the ordinary users, he or she can tell the rest.  The "wheel
group" feature would make this impossible, and thus cement the power of
the rulers.

   I'm on the side of the masses, not that of the rulers.  If you are
used to supporting the bosses and sysadmins in whatever they do, you
might find this idea strange at first.
