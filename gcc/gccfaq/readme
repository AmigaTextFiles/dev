This archive contains the texi and Amigaguide versions
of the GCC FAQ version 0.6.  Unfortunately, it still needs
more updating, but I have been asked to upload it.

The most current forms of this guide, along with pointers
to more Amiga Developer Environment (ADE) information,
will always be available on my amiga web page, currently at
http://nickel.ucs.indiana.edu/~owinebar/interests/amiga/amiga.html

Hope this information is of use.
