MACHINE:A1200 although possibly any amiga with enough chip ram
        soon to be AGA only when i write the next routine
        so that i can have big multicoloured sprites
CODE:Andyrew
GFX:OJ

Status: incomplete (scrolling works though)
	next bit to right is the player

Miner Madness4 is my current project.


MinerMadness 1&2 were games i wrote with my mate merlin on
ye olde c64.  They were flip screen games, which we played to death
sadly we never released them.  If I remember ill upload them to
arnold or some other 64 site.

MM4 is 8 way scrolling up to 4 pixels a vblank.
it runs at 50 frames a second on my 1200.

the level is created from an iff picture.

its going to have a very rough light sourcing 
its just a pretty effect and i dont see the point in spending all
my processor time making it perfect. if you want perfect buy me
a gfx card and an exelorator.

BUGS:other than it just being the scroller, NONE that are mine.
     but, ifflib keeps refusing to open in some screen modes (WEIRD!)
     to fix this run codewatcher (for some reason) with madness4.x
     
     i.e. codewatcher madness4.x
     
Source is included. I use standard includes, but i also have
	my own collection of little routines which i have not
	included. They are all minor things like takeover system
	setup standard things etc.
