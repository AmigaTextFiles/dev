Short: A 68000-assembler with integrated editor
Uploader: trulsson@student.docs.uu.se (Erik Trulsson)


This is a quite nice 68000 assembler with a very nice integrated editor.
Note that it *only* handles 68000 code, there is no support for 68020
or later CPUs. 
One bug that I have found is that when tell it to try to make instructions
PC relative it attempts to do so with BSET/BCLR also which results in
illegal instructions.
