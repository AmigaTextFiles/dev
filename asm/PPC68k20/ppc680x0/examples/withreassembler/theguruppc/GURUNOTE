Guru 3.0 Note
-------------

After finding the program Guru 3.02 (from Emiel Lensink) on 
my harddisk I was wondering what would happen if I would 
simply port it to PPC using PPC680x0. It was just an 
executable (the source wasn't on my harddisk) so I reassembled
it using a very old version of MaxonAsm.

THIS WAS A 30 MINUTE PORT!!!

There are three drawers in the 'Source' directory. The
original port is actually a port without altering anything.
This means that it has been reassembled, ported by a push at
the button and assembled to PPC. However, the 'Last' button
was directly accessing the memory-location $100, which is
illegal. This problem is fixed in the second directory
(LASTbuttonfix) using the exec function Supervisor(). Yes, the
PPC actually calls a supervisor 68k command!
The last drawer (GuruPPC) is a very little modification on the
second drawer: The only thing that has changed are a few of
the strings which are modified to 'GuruPPC' instead of 'Guru'.

The size of the executables are:

68K - 17184 bytes
PPC - 62148 bytes

However, WarpOS executables are always bigger than 68k
executables. By crunching the files it is possible to give a
better representation of the code-density:

68K -  8077 bytes
PPC - 11620 bytes

As you can see, the PPC executable is only a little bit larger!

So: Happy porting!
