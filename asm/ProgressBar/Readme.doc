Thia is a quick progress bar that I wrote as an example for someone to use.

There are two different types of bars, a normal blue bar in a recessed
bevel box; and a raised bevel box in a recessed bevel box.

An quick main program has been included so you can see how to make use
of the various functions in the routines.


The code and labels should be self explanatory.  If you do need help
though, email me on dave@eclipsnz.manawatu.gen.nz
