What is this?
-------------

SearchILBM is actually a bootblock program. That's why it needs to be installed
on a floppy disk.

SearchILBM allows you to find any IFF-ILBM picture files hiding in memory.
Each picture found is then written to the disk, directly to disk tracks
(no AmigaDOS files), using trackdisk.device.

It is particularly useful when you want to rip some graphics from a (non dos)
game, provided these graphics are in IFF-ILBM format.


How to install
--------------

Just install the bootblock on a blank formatted disk.
You can use the supplied 'Install' utility:

In a CLI/Shell, type:

tools/install DF0: bb/SearchILBM10
       ^               ^---------------- Path/Name of bootblock data to install
       |
      my install command,
      not the standard AmigaDOS one!


How to use
----------

When you boot with a disk where SearchILBM is installed, a message will appear.
Just follow the instructions.

Upon completion, if pictures have been found, you have to use the supplied
utility 'PicRestore' in order to get the files in AmigaDOS format.
