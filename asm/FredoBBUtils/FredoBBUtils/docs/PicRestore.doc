What is this?
-------------

PicRestore is a small CLI only utility which works in combination with
my special bootblock: SearchILBM.

This bootblock allows you to find IFF-ILBM pictures in your memory. If any
are found, they are written to the disk tracks.

Thus, you need to use PicRestore to read these saved pics from the disk
and to save them as AmigaDOS files.


How to use
----------

Just insert the disk where the pics have been saved and run PicRestore from
a CLI/Shell:

PicRestore <destination path>
e.g. PicRestore df1:	or PicRestore dh0:temp/

Then follow the instructions.

!!! BUG !!! DO NOT USE 'RAM:' FOR DESTINATION PATH AS IT WILL CRASH !!
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT CRASHES. IF YOU FIND THE BUG PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

The pics will then be saved as PIC00.IFF, PIC01.IFF, etc...
