Included:

- Various resourced bootblocks

- Some little bootblock-related tools
- Some other utilities...
- THRASH'M-One 1.6 Assembler (Public domain I think?)


* Ready to be installed bootblocks are in the BB directory

* Full ASM sources included in the BBSRC directory!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS IS PUBLIC DOMAIN!
(But if you use or improve anything, i'll be happy to be informed of it!)

USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
I CAN'T BE TAKEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISUSE OF ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS!
ONLY USE IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
