This is a little game i am still writing (along with all the others)
its about half way through completion.
Ive got to fo another 6 (at least) weapons for the players
I can have upto 256 weapons per player but only 4 bullets each

256 different baddies
unlimited levels,graphics etc

Its a fun little game and one day ill finish it..

This probrably isnt my most technical of proggies but i think
