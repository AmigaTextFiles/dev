				fd2monam 1.0
				~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This program is used for converting fd files to MonAm's libfile.
  Usage:
    - make directory e.g. tmp/, than you copy exec_lib.fd, dos_lib.fd,
      intuition_lib.fd and graphics_lib.fd to this directory.
    - run fd2monam, which must be in the same directory with fd files, or
      change your current directory to your new directory and run fd2monam
      with full path.
  Now, libfile is in directory with fd files.

    That's all. I use this proggy with MonAm 3.02ß, so i don't know if it will
  run with other versions. Try and send me result please. Thanx.
    Apology:
  fd2monam was written year ago and i was begginer in C, so maybe there is still
  someone who will find this proggy usefull... maybe not, than use it as an
  example how to not write programs. (i'm lazy to write fd2monam again
  and better :)

  The fd2monam is freeware. You can spread it anywhere.
