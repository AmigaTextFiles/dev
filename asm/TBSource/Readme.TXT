Hello!

This is my testament (for now). I've decided to quit computers on a hobby
scale (I still work with them), so I've decided to spread all the source
code I've managed to write along the years. They are still (C) copyrighted,
but you might get some hints from them. You may also wish to ask me for
permission to continue my work or for some other perverse use of my
programs. Since some of the programs are shareware, feel free to still send
your donations to me to the address below. And goodbye, have a nice life!

Some of the programs are not finished. Read the sources/docs to find out
more.
