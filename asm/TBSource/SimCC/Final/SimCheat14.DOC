WHAT DOES IT DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With this program you can change the amount of money your city has. You
can add it, or then you can take some of it away. Technically all this
program actually does, is it changes a few bytes of data in your
CityMap.DATA file. There are two ways to use this program, through DOS or
through intuition. When using the intuition interface you have a few nice
things that you don't have if using DOS (i.e. a command line).

WHAT DO YOU NEED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you use the Intuition-interface, you will need the Req.library in your 
LIBS: directory, which is copyright Colin Fox (of Pyramid Designs).

COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program has been tested on a few different types of machines. If you
do have problems, let me know straight away so I can fix the bug. Anyway,
this program has been tested on the 68000 and 68020 processors (A1000,
A500, A2000, A2500/20) and a little bit on the 68030, so it should work
on the A2500/30 and A3000 as well. I have tested it also on KickStart
1.3 and KickStart 2.0 (37.59). I have tried to make this program 2.0
compatible. I have tested it with various special 2.0 functions and fixed
all the bugs I have been able to find.

HOW TO USE IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To use the program, simply run it from the CLI or click on its icon in
the Workbench. This way, it will open a window on your Workbench screen
(or a public screen with the Shanghai-mode on). In the window you will
see a string gadget (the box with the number in it). The amount you see
in the box is the amount you will have in your game after you have made
the change. If, for some reason (like running a script for all your
cities), you would like to use the CLI-interface, run the program with
the filename of the city after it.

 O.K. If you didn't get that here's the whole thing step by step...

	Running from the WORKBENCH
	--------------------------

 Click on the program's icon. This will run the program, goto 'The
INTUITION-interface', step 2.

OR

 Click once on the city map's icon while holding down the SHIFT-key
and then twice on the SimCheat icon (hold down the SHIFT-key all the
time, from the point of clicking _ONCE_ on the map's icon to the point
where you click _TWICE_ on the SimCheat icon.)


	The INTUITION-interface
	-----------------------

1. Run the program
	1> SimCheat

2. Give the amount of money you would like to have (in the game of
   course :-)

3. Choose CHEAT! from the menus.

4. Give the filename of the city

5. Click OK. And when it asks 'Do you want to cheat this city' click
   OK again.

Here is some more about the windows and menus...

		THE MENUS
		---------

There is only one menu in the program. The menu 'Project' has four
items: CHEAT!, Help, About, Quit.

	CHEAT!	Amiga-C	- This will ask first for the filename of
			  your city and then change it. You can
			  choose CANCEL! after selecting a file
			  if you feel like it.

	Help	Amiga-H	- This will give you some help. If
			  running under KickStart 2.0, you can
			  also use the Help-key.

	About	Amiga-A	- This will give you the copyright notice 
			  etc.

	Quit	Amiga-Q	- This will let you leave the program.
			  You can also leave the program by click-
			  ing on the window's close gadget or by
			  pressing the Escape-key.

	The DOS-interface
	-----------------

1. Run the program with the filename
	1> SimCheat Mydisk:MyDir/MyCity

OR if you have spaces in your directory names or filenames.

	1> SimCheat "Mydisk:MyDir/Some Where"

You can also get some help by running the program from the CLI and add-
ing a question mark after it.
	1> SimCheat ?

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DOS- AND INTUITION-INTERFACES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main difference is that when you use the program through the DOS-
interface you don't get all of the error-checks and of course you don't
get the windows. One other major thing (using intuition) is that you get
to choose how much money your city gets. Through DOS you'll always get
$16, 777 215.

ERROR MESSAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program checks for just about every possible error, just in case.
I hate programs that crash my whole system if they couldn't open a 
library etc. I also hate programs that don't give the user any kind of
message if there has been a file error (say, 'No disk in drive XXX:'),
and then it gives you something like 'Disk error.', so I have included
the most important disk errors. The only problem is if run from the
Workbench. If there is an error, like the program couldn't open lib-
rary, the texts will go to a device called NIL: (i.e. you won't see
the error text). If you are having trouble and not getting any error
texts, to tell you what is going on, run the program from the CLI.
 SimCheat also checks to see if the file you have given it is actually
a SimCity city-file. If the file isn't, it will tell you about it and
ask if you would like to change the file anyway (for possible future
versions of cities that mess up my great file checker).

VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~
Here is a list of changes etc. between different versions, starting
with the newest version.

Version	 Size	Date	Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.04	 7456	01/5/91	Optimized code. Size from version 1.03 (7732)
			to version 1.04 (7556) dropped quite a bit! 
			(Don't forget that I ADDED stuff to the pro-
			gram also...) Added ability to handle quotes.
			This means you can have spaces in your file-
			names. Fixed some CShell bugs still in code.
			Added version number into CLI help text.
			Fixed menus by 1 pixel :)
			BUGS: Unknown.
		
1.03	 7732	30/4/91	Fixed bug that stopped program from working
			with CShell. Added some error texts and added
			NIL: so the texts go there if run from WB.
			Changed icon a little bit.

1.02	 7720	27/4/91	Fixed bug that crashed program when run from
		28/4/91	the WB and the map was in a directory (!)
		29/4/91	and not in the root. Fixed font bug. Added
			Zoom gadget for 2.0. Fixed bug that caused
			Workbench to think it has lots and lots of
			visitor windows (_LVOUnlockPubScreen =
			_LVOLockPubScreen). Added text after the
			change has been made (so you don't start
			wondering why isn't anything happening,
			when its actually been done already...)
			Checked the docs.

1.01	6984	26/4/91	Added some Workbench stuff. Now added an
		27/4/91	icon to the program. Fixed little bug that
			stopped CHEAT! (from menus) from working the 
			first time it was selected. Updated docs.

1.00	6320	19/4/91	Added a dollar sign into the window. Fixed bug
			that stopped program from working through the
			DOS-interface. Tested program also with 68000.
			Changed string gadget border from image to 
			real border. Checked the documents. Added
			check for files when using the DOS-interface.
			Changed name from SimCCheat to SimCheat.
			Added font stuff, so when 60-column mode set
			in prefs, the texts come out OK.

0.00a-	 6144	18/4/91	Wrote the program. Included DOS- and Intuition
0.99a			interface, possibility to change amount of 
			money for city, tested with 68020, KS 1.3/2.0.

FUTURE VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(No, no i'm not going to write an AREXX interface...)
Future versions will only have optimized code and possible bug fixes. At
this moment I have nothing to add to this program :(. But if YOU have
something you would like to see, leave me some mail, call me or contact me
by some other means.

WARNING ABOUT SIMCITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. When using PublicScreens with SimCity be careful when exiting. If your
PublicScreen is the default screen and it has the SHANGHAI-flag set,
SimCity (when exiting) will think that it is the Workbench and will not
re-open the real Workbench screen.
2. It seems SimCity will not start when there is a program that uses the
audio.device, like SetBeep (It plays an IFF-sample when the screen is
flashed). Remove these before trying to start SimCity.

THANKS ETC.
~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks go to Kai Sainio for reporting the bug with CShell.
