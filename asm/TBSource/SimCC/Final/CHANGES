CHANGES
~~~~~~~

Version		Date	Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1.07	15200	03/10/91 Increased size. Updated version number to
			 1.07. Uploaded to MITS.
1.06	11632	01/05/91 Problem with program name not fixed. Rework-
			 ed whole help-system (you'll most likely see
			 it in my other programs also). File size 
			 grew a lot though, so if you don't play PoC,
			 save version 1.04. New optimization needed,
			 _not_ done in this version.

1.05	 ----	--/05/91 Added stuff for Ports of Call. Thinking about
			 renaming again. NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION.

1.04	 7456	01/05/91 Optimized code. Size from version 1.03 (7732)
			 to version 1.04 (7556) dropped quite a bit! 
			 (Don't forget that I ADDED stuff to the pro-
			 gram also...) Added ability to handle quotes.
			 This means you can have spaces in your file-
			 names. Fixed some CSHELL bugs still in code.
			 Added version number into CLI help text.
			 Fixed menus by 1 pixel :)
			 BUGS: Unknown.
		
1.03	 7732	30/04/91 Fixed bug that stopped program from working
			 with CSHELL. Added some error texts and added
			 NIL: so the texts go there if run from WB.
			 Changed icon a little bit.

1.02	 7720	27/04/91 Fixed bug that crashed program when run from
		28/04/91 the WB and the map was in a directory (!)
		29/04/91 and not in the root. Fixed font bug. Added
			 Zoom gadget for 2.0. Fixed bug that caused
			 Workbench to think it has lots and lots of
			 visitor windows (_LVOUNLOCKPUBSCREEN =
			 _LVOLOCKPUBSCREEN). Added text after the
			 change has been made (so you don't start
			 wondering why isn't anything happening,
			 when its actually been done already...)
			 Checked the docs.

1.01	6984	26/04/91 Added some Workbench stuff. Now added an
		27/04/91 icon to the program. Fixed little bug that
			 stopped CHEAT! (from menus) from working the 
			 first time it was selected. Updated docs.

1.00	6320	19/04/91 Added a dollar sign into the window. Fixed bug
			 that stopped program from working through the
			 DOS-interface. Tested program also with 68000.
			 Changed string gadget border from image to 
			 real border. Checked the documents. Added
			 check for files when using the DOS-interface.
			 Changed name from SimCCheat to SimCheat.
			 Added font stuff, so when 60-column mode set
			 in prefs, the texts come out OK.

0.00a-	 6144	18/04/91 Wrote the program. Included DOS- and Intuition
0.99a			 interface, possibility to change amount of 
			 money for city, tested with 68020, KS 1.3/2.0.
