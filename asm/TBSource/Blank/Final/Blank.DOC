Updated: 23/07/91    - for version 0.01c

This program is based heavily on Jukka Marin's program "Keskeytysesi-
merkki v1.5". All the blanking code is from that program. The only
reason why I used that code was to speed up writing this program.
The Blank program is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind,
and the author is not responsible for any damage this software may do.

***********************************************************************
		THIS PROGRAM IS MOSTLY A HACK. BE WARNED!
***********************************************************************

WHAT DOES IT DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a normal blanker upto a certain poin (i.e. it turns off the
screen if there is no user activity or the is no special activity from
the computer). Blank changes a few library vector offsets, so whenever
a screen or window opens or some text is being written on the screen
the blanker "lights" up the screen again.

COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program tests for Kickstart 2.0 and if it is the current kickstart, the
program will also patch the new Open(Screen/Window)TagList vectors. It will
also patch the dos library vector for the Write function.

HOW TO USE IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Start the program from the CLI.

	1> Blank NN

Where NN is the time to wait before blanking.

To get some info/help, you can use

	1> Blank ?

ERROR MESSAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At this moment the program is a quick hack, i.e. no error messages.

PROBLEMS
~~~~~~~~
If you've got the graphics.library Text patched and you've got some kind of
a clock on the screen it the screen will not blank. You'll have the same
problem if you have a drawer/device open in the WB. It seems to print
something in it around every 3 secs.

VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~
Here is a list of changes etc. between different versions, starting
with the newest version.

Version	 Size	Date	 Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------
0.01c	 2004	23/07/91 Changed Write function to change only under
			 Kickstart 2.0 or higher.

0.01b	 2004	04/06/91 Added OpenNewScreenTagList and OpenNewWindow-
			 TagList. Added some texts (Break, version...)

0.01a	 1024	03/06/91 Wrote program. Not properly tested. Docs not
			 checked.

FUTURE VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Future versions, if any, will have optimized code, possible bug fixes.
Command line options will most likely pop up aswell, a possibility to
choose which vectors to patch (i.e. when to stop blanking).

MY HARDWARE
~~~~~~~~~~~
If the program doesn't work, compare your hardware with mine and see
what's different. (The list is universal for all my programs at pre-
release stage, so don't get any funny ideas...)

Amiga B2000
Amiga A2620
Amiga A2090a
Amiga A2286
Amiga A2058 (2 Megs)
Supra Modem 2400zi
Paradise Basic EGA
CBM MPS1250
Philips 8833

BUGS
~~~~
No known bugs at this time. The old dos.library bug fixed for version
0.01c. Under Kickstart 2.0, the dos.library has been changed into a normal
library.

COPYRIGHTS
~~~~~~~~~~
This program originally written for a friend. The real blanking part
was written by Jukka Marin (it stole it from him, why invent the
wheel 50 time over?). That I suppose means that he has most of the
copyrights.                  ^^^^^^^
