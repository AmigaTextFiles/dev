This program is freely distributable. This means that you can copy it and 
give it to all your friends, upload it to a BBS or include it in a PD-
library (FISH etc.). The only restrictions are that all of the files are
included in their original form without additions, deletions, or modifi-
cations of any kind and that it IS NOT SOLD. THIS INCLUDES GERMAN PD 
SELLERS. If you want to use this program for commercial purposes you
need written permission. The Tx program is provided "AS IS" without
warranty of any kind, and the author is not responsible for any damage
this software may do.

WHAT DOES IT DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program prints any ASCII file, except slower. It will print the file
character by character, but will have a little delay in between them.
This program was written because I was totally bored and tired. Meaning I
didn't have enough brain CPU time running to do something more important.

COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program will has been tested only under and will only work with
Kickstart 2.0 or higher. Tested under 68020 (A2500/20).

HOW TO USE IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Start the program from the CLI.

	1> Tx FileName

... where FileName is the name of the file you wish to print

Or for some info on the program 

	1> Tx ? | -? | h | -h

WRITING THE FILES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The files that Tx prints can be normal ASCII files, but for this purpose Tx
is not at all useful, since it is slower that the normal Type-command. The
thing with Tx is, that it can have special commands hidden in the file.
Here is a short list of commands Tx understands:

	!	Clear CLI/Shell
	0 - 3	Speed. 0 = no delay, 1 = Fast, 2 = Medium, 3 = Slow
	b	Bold on
	c	Cursor off
	C	Cursor on
	d	Delay. Makes one delay of 'Speed'
	i	Italic on.
	p	Plain. Turns off italic/underline-bold/etc.
	r	Reverse.
	u	Underline.

To start giving the commands use an escape character (27 dec, $1B hex).
After this you may enter as many effect commands as you wish. To end giving
the commands enter another escape character. Examples:

Normal:	[ESC]i[ESC] This is in italic. [ESC]p[ESC]
Hex:	1B691B54 68697320 69732069 6E206974 616C6963 1B701B

Would print "This is in italic" in italic. Check the TT file for more
examples.

NOTE: The commands are case sensitive!

ERROR MESSAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program will give some help and some error messages.
