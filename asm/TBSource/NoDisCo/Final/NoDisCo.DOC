1. WHAT DOES IT DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NoDisCo stands for No Disconnect. It will send a SPACE and a BACKSPACE to
the requested device. This will, in most cases, stop you from being thrown
out of a BBS system (keyboard timeout).

2. WHAT DO YOU NEED?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll need an Amiga computer (see compatibility list), with Kickstart
2.04 (version 37 or higher). Basically you'll also want a HAYES compatible
modem or some other piece of equipment connected to the device you specify.

3. COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NoDisCo will work on any Commodore Amiga, running on Kickstart
2.04 or higher. This includes the following: A500(+), A600, A1000, A1200,
A2000, A2500/20, A2500/30, A3000 (16 MHz or 25 Mhz model), A4000/40. The 
program SHOULD work on any upgrades (based on the Amiga Development 
Guidelines, see Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual (Release 2): Includes 
and Autodocs, introduction). NoDisCo works with all internal modems (I 
have a Supra 2400zi) and extra serial boards that support the normal 
device commands (I also have the A2232 serial board :).

4. HOW TO RUN IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run the program from a CLI/SHELL/etc. but you can't hang an icon on
it and start it from the Workbench. I decided to drop the Workbench startup
code to make the program a little bit smaller.

To run the program, enter the following into your CLI/SHELL/etc.

	1> NoDisCo D=DISABLE/S,TIME/N/K,DEV=DEVICE/K,UNIT/N/K,SPEED/N/K

	DISABLE allows you to disable NoDisCo on startup. Use D as an
	abbrieviation.

	TIME specifies how often the space-backspace sequence is to be
	sent.

	DEVICE specifies the device.

	UNIT specifies the device unit.

	SPEED specifies the speed to use on the device.

5. USING NODISCO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program sends the space-backspace sequence to the device at the speed
set at desired intervals. It can be disabled by send a CONTROL-D to the
program (by pressing CTRL-D, or with the Break command). CONTROL-E will
enable NoDisCo again.

6. HINTS & TIPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Combining scripts and function keys on some terminal programs will allow
you to enable/disable NoDisCo as needed.

7. PROBLEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~
If you wish to run NoDisCo with a terminal program at the same time (the
main idea), you must have a terminal program that opens the device in
shared mode. If it doesn't, you'll have to quit the terminal program and
then run NoDisCo.

8. ERROR MESSAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The NoDisCo program will display necessary error messages. I HATE
PROGRAMS THAT DON'T TELL WHAT-THE-HELL IS GOING ON! That clear? If
NoDisCo doesn't give any output, something is seriously wrong or
I was lazy :).

9. VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Version Size	Date	 Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.00	1880	10/01/93 Simple, but works.

0.00a-	????	10/01/93 Wrote the program basics and main routines.
0.99a

10. FUTURE VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Future version will have the bug fixes for the bugs I haven't found and you
have :).

11. BUGS
~~~~~~~~
NoDisCo has been run with enforcer. Nothing found.

12. SHAREWARE FEE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NoDisCo is ShareWare. I am not asking for a huge amount of money so I hope 
I will get some response. The fee is only $1 to $2 (USD), or whatever that 
happens to make at the moment you're reading this, in german marks (DM). 
If you're from Finland a sum of 5 FIM to 500 FIM is great.

13. BETATESTERS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NoDisCo has been betatested by me and and Joakim Laine. Thanks to both :)

14. 'REGISTERED' USERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anyone who does will get their name here if they wish so.

Joakim Laine		-His idea, he needed it, I wrote it.

15. BUG REPORTS ETC...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Please send donations, bug reports, and list of features you would like to
have included in future versions to
