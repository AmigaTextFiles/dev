CHANGES
~~~~~~~
Version Size	Date	 Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.19    22600	26/05/93 Added a version number to the prefs file. I 
			 also added some empty space so newer versions
			 will load older prefs files until a radical 
			 change happens in it.
			 Added some stuff to the docs.

1.18    22596	22/05/93 Added scripts to archive. Added XON/XOFF, but
			 never tested it. Fixed the bug with setting
			 parameters. Changed a lot of code that had to
			 do with opening/closing devices, creating/
			 deleting Requests/MsgPorts.

1.17    21864	25/03/93 Added possibility to open a port with a 
			 specific name. It is specified when ShellTerm
			 is run and not in the prefs file! This is to
			 save the trouble of making separate prefs 
			 files for every application.

1.16    21736	24/03/93 Fixed a major bug in the routine that opens 
			 the device. ShellTerm should now work on 
			 multiple serial boards and maybe some other 
			 exotic devices.

1.15    21828	10/02/93 The dialer won't be in Edit mode if quit. 
			 Thus you won't accidentally erase an entry 
			 if you first quit the dialer (while in edit 
			 mode) and then come back to dial.

1.14   ~22000	06/02/93 Fixed a bug in the parser. Had to press
			 <ENTER> twice if using CSH (I accidentally
			 cleared the last byte of the CLI-args).

1.13    21808	02/01/93 Added 'Execute' option.

1.12    21668	01/01/93 Release 3. All bugs should be fixed. Should
			 work on all machines, not sure about dnet.
			 Changed the parser to stand up to Commodore's
			 guidelines.

1.11   ~22000	13/11/92 Private registered copy.

1.10   ~22000	20/10/92 Added public ports. Bug fixes.

1.09    21632	06/09/92 Release 2.
			 Docs checked.

1.08   ~22000	04/09/92 Added: Cursor remap.
			 Minor optimization.

1.07   ~21000	30/08/92 Tried to get this version out as a release.
			 Docs updated a bit more and added 'Hints & 
			 Tips'.
			 Added: Upload/Download programs and dirs,
			 capture file.

1.06   ~18000	28/08/92 Bugs fixed. The dialer should work, toggling 
			 between (data/stop)bits are shown correctly 
			 even if the operation fails, added a greater
			 delay while dialing a list/single entry
			 (at least my phone line couldn't keep up)
			 Added: 'Send Break', preferences file, 'Swap
			 BS &  DEL', Phonebook entry editor, assigning
			 of CTRL-P to a key.
			 Docs updated.

1.05	16116	14/08/92 Bugs fixed: Send CTRL-P works now.

1.04	16116	11/08/92 Bugs fixed: Dialer now knows about NO CARRIER
			 and dials after removing an entry.
			 Added: Clear screen and Reset font.
			 Release version. Forgot to check the docs :(

1.03   ~16000	08/08/92 Bugs fixed: Dialer should recognize the BUSY
			 and CONNECT texts from the modem now.
			 Minor optimization.
			 The next version should be a release :)

1.02   ~17000	06/08/92 Bugs fixed: Input is now flushed on starting
			 to prevent ugly things from happening when
			 going into the menus and there has been
			 options on the CMDline.
			 Added: Preferences (local echo, speed CR/LF
			 translating, data & stop bits)
			 Minor optimization.

1.01   ~10000	05/08/92 A beta tester version, now with phonebook.

1.00	????	04/08/92 A simple version without many bugs and quite
			 slow.
