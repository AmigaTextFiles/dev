@{u}WHAT DOES IT DO?@{uu}

This is a simple terminal program that @{"runs in a CLI/Shell" link "CLIStart"} window. Its
primary use is with dumb terminals hooked up to an AUX-handler. This is
the reason @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} doesn't open a window or screen. It uses standard
input and output. I use it as a substitute for JrComm (Copyright John
P. Radigan) when I'm using my dumb terminal (it's next to my bed... that
explains most of the stupid mistakes in these docs :) and want to call
a BBS without having to get out of bed and walk over to my Amiga.

@next Compatibility

@{u}WHAT DO YOU NEED?@{uu}

You'll need an Amiga computer (see @{"compatibility" link "Compatibility"} list), with Kickstart
2.04 (version 37 or higher). Basically you'll also want a HAYES compatible
modem or some other piece of equipment connected to the device you specify.
@endnode

@node Compatibility "What ShellTerm runs on"
@prev Needed
@next Install

@{u}COMPATIBILITY@{uu}

@{b}ShellTerm@{ub} will work on any Commodore Amiga, running on Kickstart
2.04 or higher. This includes the following: A500(+), A600, A1000, A1200,
A2000, A2500/20, A2500/30, A3000 (16 MHz or 25 Mhz model), A4000/40,
A4000/30. The program SHOULD work on any upgrades (based on the Amiga 
Development Guidelines, see Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual (Release 2): 
Includes and Autodocs, introduction). @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} works with all internal 
modems (I have a Supra 2400zi) and extra serial boards that support the 
normal device commands (I also have the A2232 serial board, but I missed 
a @{"bug" link "Bugs"} with it on @{"versions" link "Versions"} under 1.16 :).

@node CLIStart "How to start ShellTerm"
@prev Install
@next Usage

@{u}HOW TO RUN IT@{uu}

You can run the program from a CLI/SHELL/etc. but you can't hang an icon on
it and start it from the Workbench. I decided to drop the Workbench startup
code to make the program a little bit smaller.

To run the program, enter the following into your CLI/SHELL/etc.

	1> ShellTerm FROM [FILENAME] PORT [NAME]

	FROM specifies the @{"preferences" link "Prefs"} file to load and use.

	PORT specifies a name for the user port to open. See @{"Hints & tips 8" link "Hints"}.

You cannot, however, redirect input to the program, i.e. ShellTerm <NIL:
won't work. RUNning is also out of the question and will give the same
error text as redirecting.

Or then use the script in the scripts directory. It will take the following
options:

FROM [FILENAME]		- Same as @{b}ShellTerm@{ub}'s
SCREEN [SCREEN NAME]	- A name for the screen to open
			  (DEFAULT: ShellTerm Screen)
DEPTH [SCREEN DEPTH]	- The depth of the screen to open
			  (DEFAULT: 1)
WINDOW [WINDOW NAME]	- A name for the Shell to open
			  (DEFAULT: ShellTerm Window)
PORT [NAME]		- Same as @{b}ShellTerm@{ub}'s

The ST script needs and uses a program called PSX, by Steve Tibbett, to
open the public screen. You can change this to your favorite public screen
manager if it allows you to specify the screen specifications from the
command line.

@node Usage "Using ShellTerm"

@next Main_Menu

@{u}USING SHELLTERM@{uu}

Once the program has been started, anything typed into the CLI/Shell will be
sent to the selected device. If the device does not echo the characters, you
will not see anything. Normally there is a modem at the end of the device
and you will see whatever was typed. Try typing "AT <RETURN>". If it works,
you'll receive an OK text from the modem. If however there was terminal
hooked up, the characters should have appeared on its screen. If this didn't
work, please check the device's parameters from the @{"preferences" link "Prefs"} menu.
Say the characters are messed up, try checking the @{"serial speed" link "Serial"}.
 Pressing CTRL-P will show you the menus. The CTRL-P sequence is not sent
over to the device. You will be displayed with the options available. Press
the key enclosed in parenthesis to select an item. A short description of all
items follows.

@next Hints

@{u}THE PHONEBOOK@{uu}

@{b}ShellTerm@{ub} has a phonebook and autodialer. The phonebook file is currently
the same file as the @{"preferences" link "Prefs"} file (changed for @{"version" link "Versions"} 1.06)
'S:ShellTerm.PREFS'. As of @{"version" link "Versions"} (well, at least IN @{"version" link "Versions"}) 1.06 the
phonebook entries are entered with the program itself. Go to the autodialer
and turn the edit mode on. Then select the entry you wish to edit/give the
number to. When you're finished just turn of the edit mode and dial away.
If you wish to save the phonebook, you'll have to go to the @{"preferences" link "Prefs"}
menu and select 'Save prefs'.

@node Hints "Hints & tips"
@prev Phonebook
@next Other

@{u}HINTS & TIPS@{uu}

1. A scrollback buffer is available simply by using the Console Buffer
program by William J. Fritz (CB is @{"Copyright" link "Copyright"} (c) 1990 by William J. Fritz).

2. If you use my RingDetect program see its docs to see how to quit the
program from a script and how to restart it again after quitting @{b}ShellTerm@{ub}.
 On a multi-user Amiga (like mine), each user can have their own 
@{"prefs-file" link "Prefs"} by simply making an alias in their '.login' file or the global
'.login' file. You can use something like this:

alias	st	$home/.strc

Where 'st' will be the alias that starts @{b}ShellTerm@{ub}, '$home' a variable to
the users home directory and '.strc' the name of the @{"prefs-file" link "Prefs"}.

3. To emulate 'Quiet' mode, simply enter the menus.

4. To do downloads / uploads use one of the RZ and SZ commands available.
   Different protocols are widely available. RZ and SZ are for ZModem
   transfers.

5. To use a UNIX, through modem or otherwise, use the ANSI termcap:

set term = ansi
setenv TERM ansi

or

tset ansi

This way the Shell will display things correctly (including IRC!). It works
at least on BSD systems.

6. To make sure the modem doesn't hang up if you quit @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} for some
purpose, set the modem to not hang up when DTR is dropped.

7. A program called WatchPort is included with the @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} archive.
Thanks go to Klaus Seistrup for this program. It will allow a script to
wait for @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} to quit before continuing. A short quote from him:

---Cut Here---
"Now, my plans for the port of @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} is to use it as an identifier to
decide when to return to TrapDoor again. I imagine something like this
might do it:

    FKey "7:SPAWN \"Execute S:ShellTerm.launch\""

and the script S:ShellTerm.launch:

    NewShell CON:blah/blah/blah FROM S:ShellTerm.bat
    WatchPort ShellTerm_MyPort1

And S:ShellTerm.bat contains just one line:

    ShellTerm PORT=ShellTerm_MyPort1

"
---Cut Here---

He uses this combination with trapdoor. It is of course possible to use it
with other programs that require waiting. See HINTS & TIPS 8.

8. To open @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} on its own screen, open a public screen with your 
favorite public screen manager and use a script like the one included in
this archive in the directory ShellTerm/Scripts.

@{u}OTHER INTERESTING STUFF@{uu}

@{b}ShellTerm@{ub} was written in assembler with the one and only Cygnus Editor. It
was compiled with A68k and Blink. The size of the source code is ~63000
bytes, equalling ~3200 lines of code. It is lightly commented. The version
number is bumped up every time I feel like it, which is usually when I get
bored of adding things, have found a @{"bug" link "Bugs"} or feel like releasing the whole
thing.
@endnode

@node Problems "Possible problems that You might encounter"
@prev Other
@next Errors

@{u}PROBLEMS@{uu}

The program reads and writes characters to and from the selected @{"serial device" link "Serial"}. 
If however you have a BBS software, or any other program that
uses the same device, most characters will go to the other program. You
may not notice this if you go straight to the @{"dialer" link "Dialer"} and start dialing. 
I have often started to wonder what @{"bug" link "Bugs"} i've managed to get into the
@{"dialer" link "Dialer"} when it won't recognize a busy... After some debugging I
realized that half of the characters were going to another task!
 There will most likely be a problem with high speed modems. I doubt very
much that @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} will keep up with USRobotics (R) HST modems. I don't
even want to think of the new V.FAST that's coming!

@{u}VERSIONS@{uu}

Version Size	Date	 Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.25    23256	31/07/93 Fixed a bug I added with CTS/RTS handshaking.

1.24   ~23264	17/07/93 Made a little safer to use.

1.23    23264	05/07/93 Added CTS/RTS handshaking, fixed XON/XOFF.

1.22   ~23000	04/07/93 Works with dnet.device. [Proved wrong later]

1.20    22600	23/06/93 Changed the docs to AmigaGuide format. Fixed 
			 a text string from the program.

1.19    22600	26/05/93 Added a version number to the @{"prefs-file" link "Prefs"}. I 
			 also added some empty space so newer versions
			 will load older @{"prefs-files" link "Prefs"} until a radical 
			 change happens in it.
			 Added some stuff to the docs.

1.18    22596	22/05/93 Added scripts to archive. Added XON/XOFF, but
			 never tested it. Fixed the @{"bug" link "Bugs"} with setting
			 parameters. Changed a lot of code that had to
			 do with opening/closing devices, creating/
			 deleting Requests/MsgPorts.

1.17    21864	25/03/93 Added possibility to open a port with a 
			 specific name. It is specified when @{b}ShellTerm@{ub}
			 is run and not in the @{"prefs-file" link "Prefs"}! This is to
			 save the trouble of making separate 
			 @{"prefs-files" link "Prefs"} for every application.

1.16    21736	24/03/93 Fixed a major @{"bug" link "Bugs"} in the routine that opens 
			 the device. @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} should now work on 
			 multiple serial boards and maybe some other 
			 exotic devices.

1.15    21828	10/02/93 The @{"dialer" link "Dialer"} won't be in Edit mode if quit. 
			 Thus you won't accidentally erase an entry 
			 if you first quit the @{"dialer" link "Dialer"} (while in edit 
			 mode) and then come back to dial.

1.14   ~22000	06/02/93 Fixed a @{"bug" link "Bugs"} in the parser. Had to press

@{u}FUTURE VERSIONS@{uu}

Future version will have the @{"bug fixes" link "Bugs"} for the bugs I haven't found and you
have :). And if some really needs to use this with the dnet.device (as I've
heard), mail me some info on it etc. I'll look into it myself if I find the
time. I have also been pressed towards adding a VT100 emulation... This I'm
afraid is not going to happen, at least yet... :(. A log for the @{"dialer" link "Dialer"} is
also one idea I have.

@{u}SHAREWARE FEE@{uu}

As of @{"version" link "Versions"} 1.04, @{b}ShellTerm@{ub} is @{u}ShareWare@{uu}. I am not asking for a huge
amount of money so I hope I will get some response. The fee is only $5 to
$10 (USD), or whatever that happens to make at the moment you're reading
this, in german marks (DM). If you're from Finland a sum of 20 FIM to 50
FIM is great (Yeah, so what if I changed the $10 to $12 ? You Finnish guys
don't have to pay so much for postage :). Any amount in Coca-Cola (TM) will
also do.
