1. WHAT DOES IT DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ClockServer waits for some action on the file 'T:CS_DateTime' and then
replaces it with the current time and date. Its main use is with ParNet and
a machine that does not have a battery backed-up clock. On the machine that
has a hardware clock you must run this server program and when you wish to
transfer the date/time to the other machine you execute the 'GetDate' script.
The script will ask the server to make another script file (RAM:T/CS_DateTime) 
that has the system time in it and then execute this.

2. WHAT DO YOU NEED?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll need an Amiga computer (see compatibility list), with Kickstart
2.04 (version 37 or higher). You'll also need the ramdisk mounted and it
must contain the 'T' directory.

3. COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ClockServer will work on any Commodore Amiga, running on Kickstart
2.04 or higher. This includes the following: A500(+), A600, A1000, A2000,
A2500/20, A2500/30, A3000 (16 MHz or 25 Mhz model). The program SHOULD
work on any upgrades (based on the Amiga Development Guidelines, see
Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual (Release 2): Includes and Autodocs,
introduction) and future A4000-series.

4. HOW TO USE IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just type 'Run ClockServer'.

6. BUGS
~~~~~~~
ClockServer has been run with enforcer. In other words, I haven't found
any bugs, so far.

7. SHAREWARE FEE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of version 1.00, ClockServer is FleeWare. I am not asking for a huge
amount of money so I hope I will get some response. The fee is only $5 to
$10 (USD), or whatever that happens to make at the moment you're reading
this, in german marks (DM). If you're from Finland a sum of 20 FIM to 50
FIM is great (Yeah, so what if I changed the $10 to $12 ? You Finnish guys
don't have to pay so much for postage :) [NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS VERSION]
