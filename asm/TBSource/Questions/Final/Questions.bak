WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program is designed to help students learn. It will ask questions
from the student, verify it with the correct answer(s) and tell the
student whether or not he/she was correct. It will also keep score of
the students progress and there is a possibility to save the scores onto
disk (Not available yet).
 The program is divided into the parts or modes. The first, student
mode, asks the questions, and the second, teacher mode, allows the
teacher, or students, to make the questions that are to be asked.

WHAT DO YOU NEED?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the current versions:

                        An Amiga computer running on
                        Kickstart 2.0 or higher O.S.
                        Minimum memory required 512 KB

And if you intend to write your own questions, you'll need a lot of
imagination! PLEASE NOTE: Copying questions from school books etc. is
usually illegal! Please check copyright notices from book etc.

HOW TO USE QUESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting the program
--------------------
From the Command Line Interface (CLI) or Shell use:

CLIPrompt> Questions <RETURN>

(The Workbench interface is not implemented yet.)

Main screen options
-------------------
This sections describes all the functions available from the main
screen. Some of the functions are available at certain times (like the
save functions are available only in the teacher mode).

Main-menu:

 - Start

This starts the asking of questions. If the student hasn't given there
name yet, the program will ask for it first. If there is no question set
loaded, again the program will ask the user for it first and load it.


 - Enter name

When this is selected, the screen is cleared and a box appears in the
middle of the screen. The user is asked to type in their name for
further references (saving it to disk). It will not allow a blank name.
You must input something.


 - Load

This allows the user to load a question set. A requester (a box with
filenames in it) appears onscreen waiting for input. The question files
usually have the ending '.QUE'. By default, no other files will be
shown, making it easier to find the question files. Using the
requester is not explained here, it should be taught along with other
basics of using the Amiga computer.


 - Save (teacher mode only)

After making changes to questions or after writing them, you will most
likely want to save them for later use. This option saves the questions
with the current filename (i.e. the file name given via 'Save as'
earlier, or via 'Load').


 - Save as (teacher mode only)

This is basically the same as 'Save' except it prompts for the filename
first. The same type of requester that is used with load pops up asking
for the file name. The program does not add the extension '.QUE' which
indicates that this file is a question file. It is not nessesary, but
prefered since the load requester normally shows only files that have
the extension.


 - Help

The help function built into the program is simply a reference to help
the user check what a function does or how it works. Using the help
utility is simple. If in need of help on help, press the help key. Could
it be simpler? Below is a list of functions available under help:

- Gadgets (buttons) from left to right

Prev                    - Go to PREVious page
Quit                    - Quit help and go back to main program
Next                    - Go to NEXT page

The close gadget at the top left of the window acts also as quit.

- Menus

        Menu    Item            Short cut/key combination
        ----    ----            -------------------------
        Main-menu
                Previous        Amiga-P
                Next            Amiga-N
                Help            Amiga-H (HELP-key)
                Quit            Amiga-Q

- Keys

TO GO TO PREVIOUS PAGE:
P, arrow left, arrow down, - (minus)

TO QUIT BACK TO MAIN PROGRAM:
Q, ESCape

TO GO TO NEXT PAGE:
N, arrow right, arrow up, + (plus)


 - About

This simply brings up a requester with a copyright notice, version
number and tells the author. Future versions may have information on the
state of available memory, but this is uncertain.


 - Quit

While in the student mode, this function quits the program. It will ask
if you are sure or not and if so quits. If however, you are in the teacher
mode, it will return you back to student mode, thus it acts the same as
selecting 'Student' from the 'Mode'-menu.


Edit-Menu: (Teacher mode only)


 - Add

This will add a question to the begining of all questions (NOTE: This WILL
change! In future versions the question will be inserted after the
current question). It prepares an empty question and answer and goes to it.

 - Undo

Selecting this causes changes made to the description and current
question, after any other action (like Previous, Next, First, etc.), to
be erased, returning the questions and description to its previous
states.

Edit all-menu: (Teacher mode only)

 - Clear

The name of this function may change. It actually should be something
like RESET. Selecting this causes all questions and answers and
the description to be cleared.


Move-menu: (Teacher mode only)

 - First

This searches the first question, goes to it and displays it onscreen.

 - Last

This does same as 'First' except it goes to the last question.

 - Previous

Goes to the previous question.

 - Next

Goes to the next question.


Mode-menu:

 - Student

This changes the mode to student mode. If already in student mode, this
has no effect.

 - Teacher

This changes the mode to teacher mode. If already in teacher mode, this
has no effect.


Preferences:

 - Set prefs

This opens up a window, in which you can change certain things that
affect the way the program behaves. You can change whether or not you
would like speech, what the speech file is (will be changed to allow use
of different devices), what to say, and screen colors.

                          programmed into the program
Save                    - saves the preferences with the current name,
                          again given by 'load' or 'save as'.

- Menus

        Menu    Item            Short cut       Explanation
        ----    ----            ---------       -----------

        Edit
                Colors          Amiga-C         Edit colors

Preferences-menu:

 - Load

This allows the user to load saved preferences. A requester (a box with
filenames in it) appears onscreen waiting for input. The default
directory for the preferences file is ENVARC:. All other system
preferences are stored here, so so are the Questions programs. The
default name for the file is 'Questions.prefs'. Again like with the
question files, other files are not shown. In this case only files which
have the extension '.prefs' are shown. Using the requester is not
explained here, it should be taught along with other basics of using the
Amiga computer.
                                                              
 - Save

After making changes to the preferences, you will most likely want
to save them for later use. This option saves the questions with the
current filename (i.e. the file name given via 'Save as' earlier, or
via 'Load').

 - Save as

This is basically the same as 'Save' except it prompts for the filename
first. The same type of requester that is used with load pops up asking
for the file name. The program does not add the extension '.prefs' which
indicates that this file is a preferences file. It is not nessesary, but
prefered since the load requester normally shows only files that have
the extension. NOTE: Since the program loads its preferences on startup,
in order the program to use your preferences, the name of the file must
be (including path) 'ENVARC:Questions.prefs', i.e. the default.

 - Get defaults

This resets all options to the preferences that are programmed into the
program. The colors are changed to standard Kickstart/Workbench colors
(version 37.175(KS)/37.59(WB)) and the speech gadgets to preferable
configurations.

 - Quit

Quits back to the main program.


Edit-menu:

 - Colors

This function brings up a so called 'color requester'. In it you can see
fours boxes, three sliders and a few other gadgets. To choose the color
to edit, click on one of the four colored boxes. After that simply use
the sliders to change the color components of that color. The first
slider changes the color component red, the second green and the last
blue.

THE TWO MODES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As said before there are two modes in the program. They are the student
mode and the teacher mode. The student mode is the mode normally used.
The teacher mode is infact an editor.

STUDENT MODE
------------
In this mode the questions are asked. The screen is divided into three
parts, information, question and answer. The top box is the description
box. It is divided into two parts, the text side, the bigger part and
the indicator box, which tells the student various things to note. In
this box you can see 'PUNC.', 'CASE' and 'ORDER'. These tell whether or
not to make sure of PUNCtuation, case and order if there are multiple
answers.
 The next part informs of score, number of questions and whether or not
there is a timer and if is the time left to answer the question.
 After this comes a two line box in which the question appears. Below
the question is a ten line box, in which the answer is displayed and
maybe in the future a multiple select box, from which to choose the
correct answer(s). Below this is the answer box, in which the student is
to answer.


TEACHER MODE
------------
In this mode your are able to make your own question sets. The screen is
almost the same as in the student mode. The only differences are the
extra gadgets and that the answer gadget from the bottom of the screen
is missing. The gadgets are, starting from the left and top in the first
box, First, below that, Last, Prev and Next. In the next box
