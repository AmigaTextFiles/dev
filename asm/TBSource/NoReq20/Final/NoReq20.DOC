WHAT DOES IT DO?

NoReq20 changes a few library vector offsets, so all programs think
that the user pressed Cancel!, No!, etc. This is handy if you are 
running a BBS or don't what requesters to pop up for some other reason.
Other similar programs are Cancel! by Bryce Nesbitt and NoReq by some-
one (couldn't find docs, sorry).
