@{u}WHAT DOES IT DO?@{uu}

This program is a small utility to convert older VoiceShell datafiles to
a newer format. This program also has the capability of converting VCLI
datafiles into @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} format.

@{b}NOTE!@{ub} This program only converts the datafile, not the prefs!

@endnode

@node Compatibility "What is VSConv compatible with?"
@prev Basics
@next CLIStart

@{u}COMPATIBILITY@{uu}

@{b}VSConv@{ub} will currently convert datafiles for @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} 1.07 upto
1.11 into the format @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} 1.12 understands. @{b}VSConv@{ub} also
converts VCLI 7.0 files.

@endnode

@node CLIStart "Starting VSConv from a CLI/Shell"
@prev Compatibility
@next Examples

@{u}STARTING FROM CLI/SHELL@{uu}

You can start the program only from a CLI/SHELL/etc.

To run the program, enter the following into your CLI/SHELL/etc.

	1> VSConv FROM/A,TO/A

	Where:  FROM is the source file, i.e. the file to convert.

		TO is the filename of the converted file.

	1> VSConv FROM S:VoiceShell.OLD TO RAM:VoiceShell.DAT


	1> VSConv FROM S:VCLI.commands TO S:VoiceShell.DAT

@node Problems "Possible problems that You might encounter"

@next Errors

@{u}PROBLEMS@{uu}

@{b}VSConv@{ub} looks at the file size to identify @{b}VoiceShell@{ub}
datafiles and if it doesn't match it tried to find a known header for VCLI
datafiles. If you specify a file that has the same length that a @{b}VoiceShell@{ub}
datafile has, but isn't one, @{b}VSConv@{ub} will still try to convert it!

@node Errors "Error messages displayed by VSConv"
@prev Problems
@next Bugs

@{u}ERROR MESSAGES@{uu}

The @{b}VSConv@{ub} program will display necessary error messages. If a window
can't be opened, the user will be informed. I HATE PROGRAMS THAT DON'T TELL
WHAT-THE-HELL IS GOING ON! That clear? If @{b}VSConv@{ub} doesn't give any 
output something has gone terribly wrong.

@{u}BUGS@{uu}

No known bugs at the moment. @{b}VSConv@{ub} might have some since this is
a rather quick hack. Be warned!
