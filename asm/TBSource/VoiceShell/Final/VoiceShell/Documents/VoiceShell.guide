@{u}WHAT DOES IT DO?@{uu}

This program is a 'replacement' for VCLI. It doesn't have the fancy
graphics etc. but it @{i}seems@{ui} to eat less CPU time and should be faster
overall. It also has some extra options.
 So what is VCLI I hear you ask. VCLI is a program by Richard Horne 
that uses his voice.library for recognizing speech. With VCLI 
and @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} you can start programs by saying the program's name. You
can @{teach link "Learning"} @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} 60 (VCLI allows 48) different words. You also
have the possibility to load a new set of words, thus giving limitless
possibilities. The more words you @{teach link "Learning"}, the less accurate 
the result will be. Thus having more than one @{"data file" link "Prefs"} might be 
a good idea.

@next Compatibility

@{u}WHAT DO YOU NEED?@{uu}

You'll need an Amiga computer (see @{compatibility link "Compatibility"} list), with Kickstart
2.04 (intuition.library and gadtools.library version 37 or higher). You'll
also need voice.library version 8.2 or higher and a sampler (see
@{compatibility link "Compatibility"} list).
 An accellerated Amiga (MC68020 or higher) is recommended for continuous
usage.
@endnode

@node Compatibility "What VoiceShell run on"
@prev Needed
@next CLIStart

@{u}COMPATIBILITY@{uu}

@{b}VoiceShell@{ub} will work on any Commodore-Amiga, running on Kickstart
2.04 or higher. This includes the following: A500(+), A600, A1000, A1200,
A2000, A2500/20, A2500/30, A3000/16, A3000/25, A4000/40, A4000/30. The 
program SHOULD work on any upgrades (based on the Amiga Development 
Guidelines, see Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual (Kickstart 1.3 
version): Libraries and Devices, introduction). 

@{b}VoiceShell@{ub} works with the following samplers:

PerfectSound
AudioMaster
GVP DSS 8
Generic samplers (inc. most homemade samplers)

@{b}NOTE!@{Ub} Most samplers will work with the generic sampler @{"setting" link "Menus"}.

@endnode

@node CLIStart "Starting VoiceShell from a CLI/Shell"
@prev Compatibility
@next WBStart

@{u}STARTING FROM CLI/SHELL@{uu}

You can start the program from both CLI/SHELL/etc. and @{Workbench link "WBStart"}.

To run the program, enter the following into your CLI/SHELL/etc.

	1> VoiceShell FROM/K,I=ICONIFY/S,PS=PUBSCREEN/K,PRI=CX_PRIORITY/N/K,
		      PK=CX_POPKEY/K,PU=CX_POPUP/K:

	Where:  ICONIFY iconifies program when run. The window won't
		be activated. Use 'I' as an abbreviation.

		FROM allows you to specify the @{prefs link "Prefs"} file (@{b}not@{ub} the data
		file).

		PUBSCREEN allows you to specify the name of the public
		screen you would like @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} to open its window
		on. If the screen name isn't given, @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} will use
		the default public screen. Use 'PS' as an abbreviation.

		CX_PRIORITY allows you to set the priority of the commodity
		hotkey. A number from -128 to 127 is allowed. Use 'PRI' as 
		an abbreviation.

		CX_POPKEY allows you to specify the keystroke that brings
		up the @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} window. @{b}NOTE:@{ub} The
		hotkey doesn't work if @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} is disabled!
		The default hotkey is <control alt v>.

		CX_POPUP specifies whether the window is to be opened when
		the program is run.

Along with the GUI, you can also use the Break command or CTRL-C to quit
the program. CTRL-D will turn @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} off (disable), and CTRL-E will
turn it back on (enable). You may also use @{"ARexx" link "ARexx"} commands to control 
the program.

You can also add this line into your S:User-StartUp to run the program when
the machine is booted.

RUN >NIL: VoiceShell

You may want to add the ICONIFY option ...

RUN >NIL: VoiceShell ICONIFY

 ... to iconify the window, when the program starts.
@endnode

@node WBStart

@next Main_Window

@{u}STARTING FROM WORKBENCH@{uu}

From the Workbench, start the program like any other, by double-clicking on
its icon. If, however, you would like to specify the @{preferences link "Prefs"} file or
iconification, use the tool types. This is done by clicking once on the icon
and selecting 'Information...' from the 'Icons' menu in the Workbench. Then
change the tool types accordingly (please refer to user manual, if needed).
Please take care with upper- and lowercase letters! The inputs ARE case-
sensitive.  If the public screen name isn't given, @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} will use
the default public screen.
 If you would like the program to run on every boot, move @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} into 
the 'WBStartUp' drawer. If you do this, don't forget to add the tool type 
'DONOTWAIT' (this applies to almost every program...). Below is a list of 
available tool types and there usage:

TOOL TYPE	VALUE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
FROM		<filename>
ICONIFY		YES
PUBSCREEN	<public screen name>
CX_PRIORITY	<Number>
CX_POPKEY	<Keystroke to use as hotkey>
CX_POPUP	<'NO' if you don't want the window to open when started>
DONOTWAIT	<NONE> (needed if program is in the 'WBStartUp' drawer)

Examples:

	FROM=ENV:VoiceShell.PREFS2
	PUBSCREEN=My_Public_Screen_1
	ICONIFY=NO
	CX_POPUP=NO
	CX_POPKEY=ctrl alt v

or

	FROM=Work:VoiceShell/VS.PREFS
	PUBSCREEN=Workbench

@{u}MAIN WINDOW@{uu}

The main window has several @{gadgets link "Gadgets"}, From the checkbox
(On/Off), you can specify whether or not to listen to speech. When
@{b}VoiceShell@{ub} is off it will eat hardly any CPU time.
 The string gadget 'Data file' holds the name of the @{"data file" link "Prefs"} which has
the commands to be run and the speech samples.
 The 'Vol Up' and 'Vol Dwn' are only active when a PerfectSound or DSS 8
sampler is used. With these two gadgets you can set the input gain of the
sampler. Please refer to your samplers manual for more information. NOTE!
The PerfectSound sampler will roll over from its maximum value to zero and
from zero to its maximum value. The GVP DSS8 doesn't have this 'feature'.
If the GVP DSS8 is being used, you can see the current gain setting next
to the 'Vol Dwn' gadget.
 The other button gadgets either 'Save' the @{preferences link "Prefs"} (window place, 
gadget settings etc.) and the @{"data file" link "Prefs"} or 'Quit' the program. These two 
may also be selected from the @{menus link "Menus"}. The last one, 'Load' will load ONLY 
the @{"data file" link "Prefs"}. NOTE! The 'Load' menuitem will load the @{prefs link "Prefs"} AND @{"data file" link "Prefs"} !
 The window has a Kickstart 2.04 Zoom gadget. When you click on this the
window will go into its iconified state. Clicking on it again will open it
up.

@{u}LEARNING WORDS@{uu}

Select Edit/Learn from the @{menus link "Menus"} to start learning new words. First 
type in the description for the word to be taught and press return. This
will bring up the sampling window. Press 'Sample' to start learning this
word and say the word. If the requester suggests you should accept, the
input volume was fine and you may press the 'Accept' button. You are asked
to do this three times. After the word has been taught, you are prompted to 
enter the command to be run when this word is recognized. Repeat the procedure
for all the commands you wish to teach.
Pressing return in the first column will ALWAYS open the sampling window. 
Be careful not to accidently press return in the first column if you are 
editing the commands to be run and not the samples themselves. Pressing 
TAB in the first column will also start the sampler.

 When the sampler window is open you will see two or four gadgets depending
on your sampler setup. A short description follows:

	Sample		- Start sampling. The program will wait for input
			  before starting.

	Accept		- Accept the previous sample and get the next one.


	Volume Up	- Turn the input gain up. PerfectSound and GVP DSS 8
			  only.

	Volume Down	- Turn the input gain down. PerfectSound and GVP 
			  DSS 8 only.

Closing the window with the window's close gadget will abort sampling, but
destroy any previous sample.
 You are asked to give 3 (three) good samples. These will be later used
to recognize the word. See 'Hints & Tips' for some tips on teaching words.
After three samples have been given the window will be closed and you can
now enter the command to be run when this word is recognized. The command
run will use the same input/output as @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} unless it is redirected 
(><NIL: for example). If the command starts with a tilde ("~") @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} 
assumes this command to be an internal one. The following internal commands 
are currently available:

	~K		- Allows you to simulate keypresses. See the @{"ARexx" link "ARexx"}
			  command 'KEY' for a more detailed explanation.

 The Get-gadget at the bottom of the window will open a file requester,
which allows you to specify the command to run. To use this gadget,
activate the desired string gadget and click on the Get-gadget.

 As mentioned earlier, you can teach @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} 60 words. In the
window however, there are only twenty gadgets (10 for descriptions and 10
for the commands and arguments), use the menus to select which set of 
words to Edit/Learn.

@{u}PREFERENCES & DATA FILE@{uu}

When you select 'Save', either from the @{menus link "Menus"} or by clicking on the gadget,
@{b}VoiceShell@{ub} will save all settings into a file called VoiceShell.PREFS, or 
the file specified with the FROM option on startup. It will be saved onto 
the assigned device ENVARC: where other system preferences are stored. It
however, is not an IFF file. This is to save space, in both code size and 
disk space. The data file will also be saved to the file specified in the 
'Data file' string gadget.
 The window place will also be saved. If the Window was zoomed when 'Save'
was chosen, the program will not however, zoom the window when the
preferences are loaded or the program is started. On startup you must 
specify the @{ICONIFY link "CLIStart"} option.

@node ARexx "ARexx commands"
@prev Prefs
@next Users

@{u}AREXX COMMANDS@{uu}

@{b}VoiceShell@{ub} can be controlled via ARexx. @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} has an 
ARexx port with the name 'VOICESHELL'. By sending ARexx messages to
this port you have almost full control over @{b}VoiceShell@{ub}.

@{u}Examples:@{uu}

To control @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} via arexx you may use the shell command RX.
It is possible to control the program from an ARexx script or straight from
the command line.

SYS:REXXC/RX "ADDRESS VOICESHELL COMMAND"

To load a prefs file named 'S:VoiceShell.PREFS2':

SYS:REXXC/RX "ADDRESS VOICESHELL 'LOAD S:VoiceShell.PREFS2'"

@{b}NOTE@{ub} the double and single quotes. @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} treats anything
after the keyword 'LOAD ' (including a space) as a filename.

@{b}NOTE WELL!@{ub} Sending ARexx commands to @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} from ITSELF 
will cause a LOCK UP in @{b}VoiceShell@{ub}. This will not affect other
programs, but you won't be able to quit @{b}VoiceShell@{ub}. If you wish to
send ARexx commands to @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} from itself, @{b}YOU MUST USE THE
'RUN' COMMAND!@{ub}

The ARexx command 'KEY' allows you to fake key presses as if you actually
typed something. This allows you to cancel requesters, use menu/gadget short 
cuts, etc. The 'KEY' command is simple to use with single keypresses, but 
works quite oddly if you wish to wedge whole text strings to the machine. 
Follow these few simple rules when using the 'KEY' command:

1. Don't forget the SPACE after the keyword 'KEY'!

2. To input text strings enter the string @{i}backwards@{ui}.

3. Use the greater than/smaller than (">", "<") characters around
   qualifiers. Available qualifiers are, for example alt, shift, capslock, 
   ctrl, lamiga, ramiga, etc. See your user's manual on commodities 
   qualifiers for more information.

4. All keystrokes are converted to lower case. If your OS version knows how
   to, then all keystrokes are handled properly, even international
   characters.

For example:

RX "ADDRESS VOICESHELL 'KEY <LAMIGA B>'"	- Cancel/Abort requesters
RX "ADDRESS VOICESHELL 'KEY <LAMIGA V>'"	- OK/Retry requesters

RX "ADDRESS VOICESHELL 'KEY gnirts txet gnol'"	- "long text string"


For more detailed information on using the ARexx language, please refer to
your user manuals.

Please see the @{"menu" link Menus} and @{"gadget" link Gadgets} for more detailed explanations 
on the following functions.

@{b}VoiceShell@{ub} supports the following commands:

@{u}MULTIPLE USERS@{uu}

Because everybody has their own way of pronouncing words and simply because
people have different voices, @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} probably won't understand
words said by person A, when person B has @{taught link "Learning"} the words. In order to get
around this problem, all the users must teach @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} to understand 
their own voice and to save their personal @{preference link "Prefs"} files.
With a simple startup script for each user, multiple users can use 
@{b}VoiceShell@{ub} on a single machine.

@endnode

@node Hints "Hints & Tips"
@prev Users
@next Examples

@{u}HINTS & TIPS@{uu}

1. When @{learning link "Learning"} words, take the first sample a few times before 
accepting it. This way you can see what the waveform is supposed to look 
like and you'll get a cleaner sample. This increases accuracy when 
recognizing.

2. To load a new prefrence file by speech, teach @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} the
word and use the following as the CLI command:

RUN SYS:REXXC/RX "ADDRESS VOICESHELL 'LOAD FILENAME'"

VoiceShell will then send itself an ARexx message telling itself to load
the file 'FILENAME'.

@{b}NOTE!@{ub} You must use the 'RUN' command when sending ARexx message from 
@{b}VoiceShell@{ub} to itself. See the section on @{"ARexx commands" link "ARexx"} 
for more information.

@{u}SHAREWARE FEE@{uu}

As of version 1.01 @{b}VoiceShell@{ub} is @{u}ShareWare@{uu}. I am not asking for a huge
amount of money, so I hope I will get some response. The fee is only $5 to
$10 (USD), or whatever that happens to make at the moment you're reading
this, in german marks (DM). If you're from Finland a sum of 20 FIM to 50
FIM is great (Yeah, so what if I changed the $10 to $12 ? You Finnish guys
don't have to pay so much for postage :)
