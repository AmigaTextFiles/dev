Thank you for obtaining VoiceShell. A lot of work has been put into writing
this program, so I hope to hear from you if you find the program useful. I
also never stop wishing that someday someone will pay the shareware fee...

To install VoiceShell you may use the 'Install' script, but it requires
that you have the Commodore Installer program somewhere in your path. If
you do not have this program, simply copy the files wherever you think is
suitable.

When you run the program for the first time it will complain about not
finding the preferences file and data file. Do not worry about these
messages, VoiceShell can't find these files, because they haven't been
created yet.

Please read the shareware notice, copyright notice and disclaimers in the
VoiceShell.guide file. You will need AmigaGuide/MultiView or some other
program capable of displaying AmigaGuide formatted hypertext to read it
properly.
