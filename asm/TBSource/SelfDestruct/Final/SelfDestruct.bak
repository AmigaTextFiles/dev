This program is freely distributable. This means that you can copy it and 
give it to all your friends, upload it to a BBS or include it in a PD-
library (FISH etc.). The only restrictions are that all of the files are
included in their original form without additions, deletions, or modifi-
cations of any kind and that it IS NOT SOLD. THIS INCLUDES GERMAN PD 
DEALERS. If you want to use this program for commercial purposes, you
need written permission. The SelfDestruct program is provided "AS IS"
without warranty of any kind, and the author is not responsible for
any damage this software may do.

WHAT DOES IT DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program simply loads a program called 'KillLKick'.

WHAT DO YOU NEED?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll need an Amiga computer (see compatibility list), with Kickstart
2.0 (intuition.library version 37 or higher). You'll need also a Sony
HiFi stereo system for listening to the great Amiga sounds, but it's
not necessary running this program... (PS. Don't forget the Coke or
competing drink).

COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SD (SelfDestruct) will work on any Commodore Amiga, running on Kickstart
2.0 or higher. This includes the following: A500(+), A600, A1000, A2000,
A2500/20, A2500/30, A3000 (16 MHz or 25 Mhz model). The program SHOULD
work on any upgrades (based on the Amiga Development Guidelines, see
Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual (Kickstart 1.3 version): Libraries
and Devices, introduction) and future A4000-series.

HOW TO USE IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If this the first time you are using a Commodore Amiga computer, even
though unlikely, go carefully through all the power switches on all
devices connected to and around (including) the Amiga, and check that
they are set to 'OFF'. Secondly check all cabling between the local
power distribution network (read: the plug) and your computer. Third
check cable(s) between your monitor/TV-set (what?) and computer. If
everything SEEMS to be OK, start turning everything on, starting from
external devices! NOTE ON A2000/A2500! If after all this, your power
light will not function, open up machine and change polarity of wires.
Oh, BTW to run the program, enter the following into your CLI/SHELL/etc.

	1> SelfDestruct [Number] [String] 

	Where:  [Number] equals a 16-bit number (1-4096, decimal) that
		indicates the desired amount of clicks to execute SD
		mechanism.

		[String] is the text string to be displayed. Maximum amount
		of characters is limited to 31 characters, to save memory.

	use

	1> SelfDestruct ?
	1> SelfDestruct -?

	or

	1> SelfDestruct -h

	to see:

Self Destruct v1.03 (5.6.92). (C)opyright Tomi Blinnikka.

USAGE: SelfDestruct [Number] [String]
Where:
        [Number] is a number from 1 to 4096
        [String] is the text to be displayed

Defaults are: NN = 3, XXX = SD

You can also click once (unless [Number] equals 1) and press 'Q' to quit
or use the Break command (CTRL-C).

ERROR MESSAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SelfDestruct program will display necessary error messages. If a window
can't be opened, the user will be informed. If a PublicScreen cannot be
locked, the user will informed etc. I HATE PROGRAMS THAT DON'T TELL
WHAT-THE-HELL IS GOING ON! That clear? If SD doesn't give any output,
output has been redirected to NIL: etc.
