1. WHAT DOES IT DO?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Logger is a Yet-Another-Pseudo-Security-System (YAPSS), but this it is also
a touch more useful, since it allows users to use your Amiga through any
device. This means you can have as many users using your Amiga as you wish
(only the hardware limits the amount of simultanous users). It also has the
capability of answering the phone, so logons through modems are also
possible.

2. WHAT DO YOU NEED?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll need an Amiga computer (see compatibility list), with Kickstart
2.04 (version 37 or higher).

3. COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Logger will work on any Commodore Amiga, running on Kickstart
2.04 or higher. This includes the following: A500(+), A600, A1000, A2000,
A2500/20, A2500/30, A3000 (16 MHz or 25 Mhz model). The program SHOULD
work on any upgrades (based on the Amiga Development Guidelines, see
Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual (Release 2): Includes and Autodocs,
introduction) and future A4000-series. Logger works with all internal
modems (I have a Supra 2400zi) and extra serial boards that support 
the normal device commands.

4. HOW TO RUN IT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run the program from a CLI/SHELL/etc. but you can't hang an icon on
it and start it from the Workbench.

To run the program, run Logger from your CLI/SHELL/etc. with the desired 
commands and options. Please note that since I haven't written a proper
parser, you MUST give the options in order.

USAGE: Logger [-1 | -2 | -3] [-l | -d] [-s Number] [Unit] [Device]
                                                                    
       Where: [-1] log login failures
              [-2] log correct logins
              [-3] log all logins
              [-l] is for local mode
              [-d] for dumb mode (no hayes commands sent)
              [-s Number] speed to use
              [Unit] is the unit number
              [Device] is the device name
                                                                    
       Default: [Device] is serial.device
                [Unit] is 0


	or use

	1> Logger ? | -? | h | -h

	for the above command line options and copyrights.

4.1 Local mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Local mode allows you to login from a CLI/Shell window. This command line
option excludes all others. It will automatically turn on dumb mode, so no
Hayes commands are sent.

4.2 Dumb mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When this is set, no Hayes commands are sent to the device. It also stops
the program from waiting for RINGS and CONNECTS.

4.3 Speed to use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This describes the speed to use on the device. The device will be opened
with this as the default speed.

4.4 Log login failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Writes all failed logins to GETTY:Logger.log. The 'GETTY:' will most likely
be changed to 'LOGGER:'.

4.5 Log correct logins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Logs all correct logins to GETTY:Logger.log. The 'GETTY:' will most likely
be changed to 'LOGGER:'.

4.6 Log all logins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Logs all incorrect and correct logins to GETTY:Logger.log. The 'GETTY:'
will most likely be changed to 'LOGGER:'.

4.7 Unit number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies the unit number of the device. Doesn't apply when local mode is
used.

4.8 Device name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Specifies device to be used.


5. USING LOGGER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To actually use logger you will also need the following programs: PassWd,
Finger (optional), W (optional), Uptime (optional) and Lock (optional).

5.1 PassWd
~~~~~~~~~~
PassWd is the program that makes and upholds the password file.

Examples:

1. Logger -3 -s2400 0 modem0.device   

2. RUN >NIL: Logger -1 -d -s38400 0 serial.device

3. Logger -l


6. HINTS & TIPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
7. PROBLEMS
~~~~~~~~~~~
Logger won't hangup if the DTR is dropped, or if the users suddenly hangs
up...

8. ERROR MESSAGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Logger program will display necessary error messages. I HATE
PROGRAMS THAT DON'T TELL WHAT-THE-HELL IS GOING ON! That clear? If
Logger doesn't give any output, something is seriously wrong or
I was lazy :).

9. VERSIONS

10. FUTURE VERSIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Future version will have real docs and some additions. Bug fixes are also
welcome.

11. BUGS
~~~~~~~~
Logger has been run with enforcer and mungwall. It will be run with devmon
as soon as I can find it again :). In other words, I haven't found any
bugs, so this part in the docs is totally useless! :)

12. SHAREWARE FEE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of version 1.05, Logger is ShareWare. I am not asking for a huge
amount of money so I hope I will get some response. The fee is only $5 to
$10 (USD), or whatever that happens to make at the moment you're reading
this, in german marks (DM). If you're from Finland a sum of 20 FIM to 50
FIM is great (Yeah, so what if I changed the $10 to $12 ? You Finnish guys
don't have to pay so much for postage :)

13. BETATESTERS 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Thank you all who betatested Logger. Thanks go to...)
 If you wish to become a betatester contact me at one of the
addresses below. If a betatester wishes to be anonymous or the the opposite,
wishes their full name to be listed, please let me know!

14. 'REGISTERED' USERS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No one has paid the shareware fee, but anyone who does will get their
name here.

15. BUG REPORTS ETC...

Please send donations, bug reports, and list of features you would like to
have included in future versions to
