2. WHAT DO YOU NEED?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You'll need an Amiga computer (see compatibility list), with Kickstart
2.04 (version 37 or higher). You'll also need the password file
'GETTY:PassWd.LOGGER' made by the 'PassWd' command

3. COMPATIBILITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finger will work on any Commodore Amiga, running on Kickstart
2.04 or higher. This includes the following: A500(+), A600, A1000, A2000,
A2500/20, A2500/30, A3000 (16 MHz or 25 Mhz model). The program SHOULD
work on any upgrades (based on the Amiga Development Guidelines, see
Amiga ROM Kernel Reference Manual (Release 2): Includes and Autodocs,
introduction) and future A4000-series.

6. BUGS
~~~~~~~
Finger has been run with enforcer and mungwall. It will be run with devmon
as soon as I can find it again :). In other words, I haven't found any
bugs, so this part in the docs is totally useless! :)

7. SHAREWARE FEE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As of version 1.03, Finger is ShareWare. I am not asking for a huge
amount of money so I hope I will get some response. The fee is only $5 to
$10 (USD), or whatever that happens to make at the moment you're reading
this, in german marks (DM). If you're from Finland a sum of 20 FIM to 50
FIM is great (Yeah, so what if I changed the $10 to $12 ? You Finnish guys
don't have to pay so much for postage :)

8. BETATESTERS
