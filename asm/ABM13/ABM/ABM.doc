  Assembler Binary Maker 1.3
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  1. Copyright and spreading
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This  program is FreeWare, so it may be spread freely providing that the
  documentation is included in the package. Making changes is not allowed.

  2. What does it do?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  There are many programs which convert binary files into assembler source
  code.   However,   all  these  programs  can  only  convert  files  into
  hexadecimal  format  ie.  'DC.B  $20'. I have never found a program that
  could  convert a binary file into assembler source binary file ie. 'DC.B
  %00100000'. That is why I created this converter.

  3. Starting the program
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This  program can be started only from the Shell or CLI. Then it asks to
  enter some parameters:

  Give source file name   : (here you should type the source file name)
  Give target file name   : (here you should type the target file name)
  Give data size: (B/W/L) : (and here you should choose the size into
                             which the data will be converted.
                             B -> DC.B, W -> DC.W, L -> DC.L)
  Give number of columns  : (here the number of columns per line is
                             requested. DC.B %00100000 -> 1 kolumna,
                             DC.B %00100000,%00100000 -> 2 kolumny)

  4. Converting process
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Immediately after start, the program allocates a work buffer of about 42
  KB.  No  additional  memory  is  allocated  during  converting,  and the
  converted  file is read part by part, which makes it possible to convert
  files  of  any  size. This means that you can convert a file the size of
  300  KB with only 50 KB of free memory. The only limit is the free space
  on  the  disk  on  which  the  target file is written. Converting may be
  aborted by pressing Ctrl+C.

  ATTENTION: I am not responsible for faulty work of this program.

  5. Program history
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  1.2 (26 May 1996)
      The first quite well working version.

  1.3 (24 August 1998)
      Program can convert files of any size and it also correctly converts
      these  ones  which length is not divisible by a chosen data size (it
      changes the size of last lines).

  That is all. Have a nice converting.
