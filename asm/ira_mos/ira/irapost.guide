@node WhatsNew "What is new for V1.05 ?"

	V1.05
	o Found a nasty little bugger. EXG A6,Xn has been overseen as
	  a change to A6. This one is removed.

	o The sourcefile has always been deleted. That's fixed.


	V1.04

	o If you don't specify a destination file, the sourcefile will 
	  be overwritten by the output. That spares some typing if you
	  are sure that IRAPOST works correctly. IRAPOST should work
	  correctly with IRA output.

	o IRAPOST is now a bit more tolerant to 'alien' asm sourcecodes.
	  That does not mean that IRAPOST always works correctly.
	  Try it out and say if you want some Xtras.

@node Description "What is IRAPOST for ?"


	IRAPOST symbolizes library calls. That means, library calls like
	<jmp/jsr -ddd(a6)> are replaced by <jmp/jsr _LVOname(a6)>.
	That makes it easier to read alien source codes.

@node Running "How to run IRAPOST"


To run IRAPOST successfully you need the following:

   o You need Commodores (or others) .FD files in some directory.
     Watch out that their names are like name_lib.fd (e.g. dos_lib.fd).
     Otherwise IRAPOST can't find the appropriate .FD file.

   o You have to assign FD: to that directory, so IRAPOST knows where to find
     the .FD files needed.

   o You have to rename all libbase loadings (like move.l lab_abcd,A6) to the
     specific libbase name (like move.l DOSBASE,A6). Best way is to find out
     where SYSBASE is loaded to (if it is loaded somewhere) and rename that.
     Then invoke IRAPOST (irapost exec file1 file2). After that search for all
     _LVOOpenLibrary/_LVOOldOpenLibrary calls and see where the libbases are
     stored. Now rename the apropriate labels.
     If you are unsure about the names of the bases, look at the .FD files.
     There is ##base entry where you find the name. E.g. it's called
     graphics.library but GFXBASE (look at graphics_lib.fd).


Now it should be no problem to run IRAPOST on all occurring libraries.
Like >irapost dos test.asm test.asm2


If you specify 'exec' as libname IRAPOST searches for SYSBASE (official base
name) and ABSEXECBASE (address $4 - very often used).
