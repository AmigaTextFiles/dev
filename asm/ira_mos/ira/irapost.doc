         Postprocessor for assembly files produced by IRA.

      (C) 1993 Tim Ruehsen. Original coded by Morten Eriksen.

       IRAPOST and this docfile are part of the IRA package.





WHAT IS IRAPOST FOR ?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
IRAPOST symbolizes library calls. That means, library calls like
<jmp/jsr -ddd(a6)> are replaced by <jmp/jsr _LVOname(a6)>.
That makes it easier to read alien source codes.



HOW TO RUN IRAPOST
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
To run IRAPOST successfully you need the following:

   o You need Commodores (or others)  .FD files in some directory.

   o You have to assign FD: to that directory, so IRAPOST knows where to find
     the .FD files needed.

   o You have to rename all libbase loadings (like move.l lab_abcd,A6) to the
     specific libbase name (like move.l DOSBASE,A6). Best way is to find out
     where SYSBASE is loaded to (if it is loaded somewhere) and rename that.
     Then invoke IRAPOST (irapost exec file1 file2). After that search for all
     _LVOOpenLibrary/_LVOOldOpenLibrary calls and see where the libbases are
     stored. Now rename the apropriate labels.
     If you are unsure about the names of the bases, look at the .FD files.
     There is ##base entry where you find the name. E.g. it's called
     graphics.library but GFXBASE (look at graphics.fd).


Now it should be no problem to run IRAPOST on all occurring libraries.
Like >irapost dos test.asm test.asm2


If you specify 'exec' as libname IRAPOST searches for SYSBASE and ABSEXECBASE.



       Have a good time,
