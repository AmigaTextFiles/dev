Documentation for Stack

       This is a replacement for the BCPL stack program, written in assembler. 
The only difference that the user should see is a smaller executable file, and a
slightly improved error message when bad parameters are used.  The minimum stack
limit is identical (1600 bytes), and there is a check that the stack size
requested is not too large.  I assembled using Metacomco version 10.178, and
linked with BLINK version 6.5.
