Documentation for ASMFilter.bas

       When using the Metacomco disassembler (DISASM) to convert a program into
a file suitable for re-assembling, it is normally necessary to do quite a lot of
work on the resulting text file.  I have written ASMFilter.bas to do a lot of
the dirty work automatically.  Simply supply the names of the input and output
files when requested, and let the program do the rest.  Rather than explain each
step of operation of the program, it is far easier to try it out, and examine
the resulting file that it creates.  When ASMFilter.bas has completed its job,
the screen will flash, and a beeping noise will be heard.  Press any key to exit
at this point.  This program will execute many times faster if compiled using
the AC-BASIC compiler.
