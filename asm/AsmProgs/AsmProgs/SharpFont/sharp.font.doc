Documentation for sharp.font

       This is an 8 pixel non-proportional font similar to the clean.font
released on Amigazine Jan87.  It is suitable for use with the blitzfonts released
on Fish 60, provided you change the name 'topaz.font' inside blitzfonts to
'sharp.font'.  This you can do with NewZap, or some other file modify program.
You should keep a copy of the standard blitzfonts, and execute it from your
startup-sequence also, so that programs that use topaz.font also benefit from
the speed-up gained from using blitzfonts.
