Documentation for AddKickMem

       This program is useable if you have Kickstart in ROM on your Amiga 1000.  
It ignores any command line parameters, it cannot be used to add other than the
memory between F80000 and FBFFFF unless you reassemble with different start and
end addresses.

       I originally wrote this program as an exercise in converting a program
from BCPL into assembler.  It is designed for speed and size, and does
absolutely no checking.  If you run it on a machine with no memory between
F80000 and FBFFFF, it will crash.  If you run it more than once since the last
warm boot, it will crash.
