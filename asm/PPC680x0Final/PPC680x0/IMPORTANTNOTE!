Important note for the promo:

THIS IS THE FINAL PUBLIC PROMO RELEASE FOR THE NEXT MONTHS!!!

Carry emulation and 64-bits implementations are set to disabled, so the
button will not work!

The FPU is removed and multiplications are set to the 'dead' state.

The program has been tested on Soft-Kicked Amigas running KS 3.0 on 2.04
systems and 3.1 A4000T060/PPC, but if you have any problems, please notify
us. Thanks!

This is an extraction from the full commercial version 1.04.

I hope I have removed all the FPU features correctly!!!
