    This is for all you who program the Amiga in 68000 assembly (Both of
you... :-).  It works just like Amiga.lib except it's only 11K instead of
over 88K.  What's missing??  All those mangy C language stubs you don't
need anyway.

    All 482 V1.2 library negative offsets are represented as is the only
absolute address in the entire Amiga, _AbsExecBase.  The file was created
from the V1.2 fd.files (gamma1) and has been 100% crossed checked with the
latest Amiga.lib.  You probably already guessed that it passed the test.

    Blink V6.5 has a bug that will manifest itself with this file.  To
avoid it use this syntax:

    blink {file}.o small.lib NODEBUG to {file}

    And not the otherwise proper:

    blink {file}.o lib small.lib NODEBUG to {file}

    Alink works either way.  The bug has been reported to John Toebes.   I
think Blink can't deal with a library file that does not have a code
segment...

  Amiga.lib is also included on this disc (without an icon - use the CLI)
and it has the standard C functions CreateStdIO, CreateExtIO, CreatePort,
DeletePort, DeleteStdIO, DeleteExtIO, CreateTask, and DeleteTask. If you
need these routines, link with amiga.lib instead of small.lib. If using
Manx asm, don't use either lib. Use Manx's c and cl32 libs.
