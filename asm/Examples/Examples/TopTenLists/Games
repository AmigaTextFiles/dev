 «««««««««« TOP TEN WORST SELLING GAMES FOR THE ATARI ST »»»»»»»»»»

10) "Kiddy Kad" Low cost, one-dimensional CAD program, ported from the VIC
     20 minus several of the features not supported by the ST.

 9) "Blitter Buster" Displayed a 400 x 200, 60 color picture within 24 hours
     and required a special monitor that connected to the ST via the Amiga's
     video port.

 8) "Championship Tiddley-Winks" Not enough action, and the fast moving
     circles taxed the ST's animation capabilities.

 7) "Magic Suck" A software simulator which purportedly allowed the user to
     run Mac applications on the ST. Instead, it caused the disk drives to
     spin backward while the monitor displayed the lyrics to the Norwegian
     National Anthem.

 6) "Romancing the GEM" Copy-protected software really >deleted< the ST's
     operating system.

 5) "Bar Trek" Futuristic, drinking game left a bad taste and quickly
     fizzled on its 5 year mission to go where no ST software had ever gone
     before: into the profitability margian.

 4) "Tramiellipede" This slimy arcade game which featured a repulsive,
    snake-like creature never lived up to its advertised hype despite
    numerous ports to various companies.

 3) "DeBase" Antagonized users with a cheap, demeaning interface.

 2) "Locust 1-2-3" Program sales suffered due to numerous bugs in the
     initial release.

 1) "Fright ST-imulator" Hideously ugly graphics inspired users to recoil in
     revolt.
