Ten Wierdest Computer Viruses.

1) OS/2 (Need we say more?)
Lack of availability severely slowed down applications intended to run on IBM
PS/2 machines. Periodic increasing memory requirements noted as well.

2) The Helsinki Bug.
Caused excessive hair loss of the computer user. Software fixes are
typically advertised on cable TV each Sunday evening.

3) The Bush Bug.
An irritating strain which basically ties up systems resources and writes
the message 'I am a kinder, gentler virus.' to the screen.

4) The Quayle Bug.
Basically a 'do-nothing' bug, this little monster spends most of its time
finding the dark recesses of disks ( where no one will find it. )
Sometimes used by the BushBug ( see above ) to prevent its own extinction.

5) The Bugs Bunny.
Periodically displays an IFF picture of Roger Rabbit french-kissing Daisy Duck.

6) The Stealth Bug.
Rumored to have been very expensive to create, the Stealth Bug is
particularly hard to trace down. However, it has not been proven to do
anything, yet.

7) The High School Hacker Bug.
Repeatedly dials local BBS's, tying up the systems with pompous
pronouncements on the superiority of certain 8-bit microprocessors.

8) MacBUG.
Costs you plenty, due to a tendency to initiate legal action at your expense.
Not related to the more widely seen McBUG, but just as greasy and cheesey.

9) Vapor Bug.
Not available at this time, but purportedly will do what all the other bugs
do, plus more.

10) The Geraldo Bug.
A rather pompus bug which provokes trouble wherever it goes. Known to
exploit system resources and prey on the user's emotions. Uses cheap, tawdry
parlor-room tricks when possible, sometimes resulting in violent,
on-screen crashes.
