 (Inspired by AmigaWorld magazine)

10) Never rename more than 1 of your floppy disks "Wanda".

 9) Do not spit on the screen until you see the "Insert WorkBench" picture.

 8) Never attempt to insert the mouse into the disk drive if there is one
    there already.

 7) When hooking up a monitor, have the glassy part face toward the user.

 6) If you meet someone whose last name is Fish, ask him for some free
    software.

 5) Never pour milk on the serial port.

 4) The mouse works best when operated by your more limber appendages.

 3) Whenever screen glare causes your eyes irritation, turn the Amiga on and
    off several times. Although this will not solve the problem, it won't
    aggravate the situation either.

 2) Avoid placing the keyboard in the path of heavy, on-coming traffic. If
    you must, secure it firmly to the pavement via a sledge hammer.

 1) Do not insert anything into the disk drive except disks, no matter how
    tempting it may be to do otherwise.
