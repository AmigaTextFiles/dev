 First compile SmallStart.asm (or StartUp.asm), YAHTZEE.asm, and CHIP.asm.
I use the CAPE assembler from Inovatronics. It is an excellent assembler/
editor package and is compatible with ALink and BLink. I then use BLink to
create the executable. YAHTZEE.asm contains a CAPE directive, SMALLOBJ,
which indicates "use PC relative addressing instead of absolute". If your
assembler doesn't support this, delete the directive and add the SECTION
statement where the data section of this module begins. Because the Manx
C compiler and assembler do not implement PC relative the way everyone else
does (typical Manx), you may not be able to assemble the switch in Evaluate.
Consult the examples I made in "ManxPCBug".

 If using BLink or ALink,

 BLink SmallStart.o Yahtzee.o Chip.o amiga.lib NODEBUG to YAHTZEE
