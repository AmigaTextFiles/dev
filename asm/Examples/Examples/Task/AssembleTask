    This is an assembly version of a C code example from Commodore
demonstrating creating a subtask. The original C code is on Fish #79.
The CreateTask function is in amiga.lib. Link with this instead of small.lib
as follows:

1>  Blink StartUp.o Task.o Functions.o NODEBUG LIB amiga.lib To Task

  Functions.o is in the libraries drawer.

  Unfortunately, the Manx assembler violates conventions (severely) and will
not accept amiga.lib. Manx has its own libraries that duplicate the amiga.lib
functions, naturally in an incompatible manner. This example is set up to
utilize amiga.lib. If you have Lattice, (an all around superior C compiler
to Manx), you'll be able to use the assembler with that package and link
with amiga.lib.
