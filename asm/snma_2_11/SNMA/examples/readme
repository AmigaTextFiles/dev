    This directory has the simple example how to use snma with arexx and
    global symbol table.

    This example uses the following files from the snma/examples directory:

      test.asm
      test.glb
      test.i

    ShellAsm.rexx, seegb.rexx and addgb.rexx which are in snma/rexx
    directory of snma.lha package must be copied in REXX: directory.

	    1) start snma if not already running ("->run snma arexx") in
	       arexx mode (RexxMaster must also be running).

	    2) first try to assemble without ADDGB. You will get two
	       errors.
	       ->rx ShellAsm test.asm

	    3) Add test.i to the global table.
	       ->rx addgb test.glb

	    4) repeat step 2. If step 3 succeed, test.asm should assemble just
	       fine and you have created test.o object module.

	    5) type: ->rx "seegb"
	       You will now see that test.i is in global table.

	    Read the "alias.txt". If you have defined the aliases it makes
	    the commands in the above steps a little shorter.

	    1) same
	    2) ->asm a
	    3) ->addgb test
	    4) same
	    5) ->seegb

	    When normally working with some project you can create one file
	    which has set of neccessary include commands (include files you
	    don't modify), for example. You have to call only once "addgb"
	    command to move all symbols and macros from the snma's global
	    table.  Enjoy...
