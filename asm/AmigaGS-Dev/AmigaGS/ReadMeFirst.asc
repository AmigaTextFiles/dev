Hello.
That archive contain a preview of AmigaGS.
What AmigaGS is ?
It's an environment made with :
       - Amiga OS libraries ( Like libraries in LIBS: drawer )
       - MACROs.
The objective of AmigaGS is to simplify games programming.
for the moment,there are only few libraries available but,
I'm working HARD to make that environment more complete.
Look at the file asm sources to see how AmigaGS work.
There are also the documentations files given for direct libraries calls.
