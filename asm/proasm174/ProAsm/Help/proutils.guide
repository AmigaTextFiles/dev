    These utilities may be useful while developing software.  They all
must be run from the shell, except otherwise noted.  All of them are
driven by keyword options in any order indicating the action to be
performed.  Quite all utilities display also a command line usage
notice when they are run with no parameters or a question mark (@{b}?@{ub}) as
parameter.  For example:
         1> profiler ?

@Node "About This Manual"

About This Manual
=================


    Welcome to the AmigaGuide version of the ProAsm utilities manual.


    This manual is a part of the ProAsm manual, which was originally written
in TeX and texinfo. You are currently looking at the AmigaGuide version of
the ProAsm utilities part. I used various tools to convert the primal TeX
source into AmigaGuide. They did quite a good job, but the result was over
700KBytes of length! As a consequence I had to shorten the whole guide file
by hand. Now it is very possible that when browsing through this manual you
will find sentences like:

          @{i}This node (page) intentionally left blank.@{ui}
or
          @{i}This node (page) was intentionally shortened.@{ui}

Please forgive me for that. I had also to skip various tables that can
be found in the original printed manual.

    Caused by the convertion of the TeX source of the manual into this
AmigaGuide file and the need of some small reorganisation of it, some of
the links go nowhere. Sorry for that, but I had not the time to check all
links. I did check a lot of them, but unfortunately there are still some of
these dead links in the guide file. If you should find any, please feel
free to inform me (@{"Daniel Weber" link "Author"}).

    If you find some strange (unusal) parts in this AmigaGuide file, please
keep in mind, that this guide initially was written as a book. You can
order a copy of the printed manual, if you wish. Please read the
registration document (register.doc or @{"Registration" link "pro.guide/Registration"}) for
further information.

@Node "Profiler"

Profiler
--------

 - small run-time statistic utility: Profiler [@{i}options@{ui} ] @{i}program@{ui} [@{i}program arguments@{ui} ]
     The @{b}Profiler@{ub} utility displays the run-time statistics for a given
     @{i}program@{ui} with its optionally given @{i}program arguments@{ui}.  It records
     the amount of time spent in each routine that is called while the
     @{i}program@{ui} runs.  When your @{i}program@{ui} ends, @{b}Profiler@{ub} displays the
     resulting run-time statistic.

     In a line of the statistic output you find (in this order):
        @{b}*@{ub} the name of the particular routine,

        @{b}*@{ub} the hunk number where the routine is located,

        @{b}*@{ub} an offset value that describes the begin of the routine
          relative to the hunk start,

        @{b}*@{ub} the number of hits @{b}Profiler@{ub} counted while the @{i}program@{ui} was
          running,

        @{b}*@{ub} the average percentage of time that was spent in this routine,
          compared with the whole @{i}program@{ui},

        @{b}*@{ub} and the location of the routine in your source code.

     To use @{b}Profiler@{ub} with your program, you have to assemble your
     program with the debug option and symbol information turned on
     (e.g. @{b}DEBUG LINE,ALL,CODE,ADDSYM@{ub}, see @{"Debugging Information" Link "pro.guide/Debugging Information"}, for
     more details).

     @{b}Profiler@{ub} supports the following command line options:
    @{b}-n @{i}num@{ui}@{ub}
          Tells @{b}Profiler@{ub} to display only routines in the run-time
          statistic with more than @{i}num@{ui} hits.  (Where @{i}num@{ui} is a decimal
          number.)

    @{b}-s@{ub}
          This option forces @{b}Profiler@{ub} to display a symbol listing.

    @{b}-t @{i}num@{ui}@{ub}
          Using this option you can specify the time interval, in
          milliseconds, between the statistic checks @{b}Profiler@{ub} does on
          your program.  If no time interval is given, @{b}Profiler@{ub}
          defaults to 2000.  (Where @{i}num@{ui} is a decimal number higher or
          equal to 100.)

    @{b}-z@{ub}
          To keep the statistic information as compact as possible,
          @{b}Profiler@{ub} does not list routines with zero hits.  However,
          this option forces @{b}Profiler@{ub} to display these routines also.

     Note that a sequence of options can be written separately (e.g. @{b}-s
     -z -t 1000@{ub}) or together (e.g. @{b}-szt 1000@{ub}).

@Node "ProHunk"

ProHunk
-------

 - 680x0/688xx Hunk Analyzer: ProHunk @{i}object file@{ui}  [@{i}options@{ui} ]
     @{b}ProHunk@{ub} is an Amiga object file analyzer that issues the binary
     hunk structure of a load or linkable @{i}object file@{ui}.  All hunks up to
     the operating system version 3.1 (v40) are supported.  See `The
     AmigaDOS Manual', 3rd Edition, Bantam Computer Books, for more
     information about AmigaDOS hunk formats.

     Next to the hunk information, @{b}ProHunk@{ub} can also display optionally
     the contents of code hunks in disassembled form and data hunks as
     hexdump.  The disassembler supports all Motorola processors up to
     the MC68040, the MC68881 and MC68882 floating-point coprocessors,
     and the MC68851 PMMU coprocessor.

     The given @{i}object file@{ui} is the name and complete path of the file
     that is to be analyzed.  The @{i}options@{ui} are optional and should be
     one or more of the following:
    @{b}-d@{ub}
          Output the contents of all data hunks as hexdump.

    @{b}-c@{ub}
          Output the contents of all code hunks in disassembled form.

    @{b}-i@{ub}
          Show contents of all debug hunks (hunk_debug) as hexdump.

    @{b}-i0@{ub}
          Show contents of all known debug hunks (hunk_debug) in a
          line/offset format.

    @{b}-q@{ub}
          Quiet, send no output to StdOut.

    @{b}-v@{ub}
          Verbose, display all entries in symbol (hunk_symbol) and
          hunk_ext hunks.

     Note that a sequence of options can be written separately (e.g. @{b}-i
     -c@{ub}) or together (e.g. @{b}-ic@{ub}).

     Example:
              1> ProHunk ProHunk

@Node "MMUInfo"

MMUInfo
-------

 - Display information on the MMU: MMUInfo [@{i}-option@{ui}  @{i}address@{ui} ]
     @{b}MMUInfo@{ub} displays various information about the current MMU
     settings and registers, or on a supplied address.

     @{b}MMUInfo@{ub} supports memory management unit of the MC68030, MC68040,
     and the MC68851 processors.  For more information about the memory
     management unit (MMU) refer to the manuals for the specific
     microprocessors.

     If @{b}MMUInfo@{ub} is run without any parameters, it reports the current
     settings of the MMU and its registers contents.

     If an option and an @{i}address@{ui} is given, @{b}MMUInfo@{ub} displays the
     translation and the page attributes of this @{i}address@{ui} according to
     the given option.  @{i}Address@{ui} is the hexadecimal address of the
     memory location the information is requested for.

     The following two options are supported by @{b}MMUInfo@{ub}:
    @{b}-d@{ub}
          Use the @{b}-d@{ub} option to perform a data space access on the given
          @{i}address@{ui}.

    @{b}-i@{ub}
          Use the @{b}-i@{ub} option to perform an instruction space access on
          the given @{i}address@{ui}.

     For example:
              1> MMUInfo -d $fc0000

     The following error messages can be reported by @{b}MMUInfo@{ub}:
    @{b}CPU must be 68020/30/40!@{ub}
          @{b}MMUInfo@{ub} expects a MC68020 or higher processor to run.
          Supported are the memory management unit of the MC68030,
          MC68040, and the MC68851 processors.

    @{b}no PMMU found!@{ub}
          No memory management unit found.

@Node "FD2LVO"

FD2LVO
------

 - Convert fd-files to _LVO equate files: FD2LVO [@{i}input path@{ui} ] @{i}output file@{ui}  [@{i}options@{ui} ]
     The @{b}FD2LVO@{ub} utility generates equate listings with library vector
     offsets using fd files.

     The utility can be started from the CLI/Shell in three different
     ways:
    @{b}FD2LVO @{i}input file@{ui} @{i}output file@{ui}@{ub}
          The fd-file @{i}input file@{ui} is parsed and converted to library
          vector offsets and written to the equate listings (@{i}output
          file@{ui}).

    @{b}FD2LVO @{i}input path@{ui} @{i}output file@{ui} -a@{ub}
          All valid fd-files in the given directory (@{i}input path@{ui}) are
          parsed and converted to library vector offsets and then
          written to the equate listings (@{i}output file@{ui}).

    @{b}FD2LVO @{i}output file@{ui} -a@{ub}
          If no @{i}input path@{ui} is given @{b}FD2LVO@{ub} scans the @{b}FD:@{ub} assign.  All
          valid fd-files are parsed and converted to library vector
          offsets and then written to the equate listings (@{i}output file@{ui}).

     The following error message can occur while processing the
     fd-files:
    @{b}No output generated.@{ub}
          No output is generated if an error occurred while @{b}FD2LVO@{ub}
          processes a fd-file.

    @{b}Couldn't open file '%s' (DOS error: %ld).@{ub}
          @{b}FD2LVO@{ub} cannot open the specified file.  Check the spelling of
          @{i}input file@{ui} and @{i}output file@{ui}.  The @{i}DOS error code@{ui} may give you
          additional information why the assembler could not open the
          file (see @{"AmigaDOS Error Codes" Link "pro.guide/AmigaDOS Error Codes"}).

    @{b}Output file crippled.@{ub}
          An error occurred while writing data to the @{i}output file@{ui}.  The
          output file may be crippled.

@Node "CLICalc"

CLICalc
-------

 - Simple CLI calculator: CLICalc @{i}expression@{ui}
     CLICalc allows you to evaluate a given @{i}expression@{ui} in an easy way.
     The returned result will be displayed as signed hexadecimal,
     unsigned hexadecimal, decimal, binary number, as ascii chars, and
     as octal number.

     The following operators are supported, sorted after their priority
     (see also @{"Operators" Link "pro.guides/Operators"}):

     @{b}CLICalc@{ub} supports the following forms for numbers (see also
     @{"Integer Constants" Link "pro.guides/Integer Constants"} for more details about integer constants and
     their formats):
    @{b} $@{i}d@{ui}@{ub}
    @{b}0x@{i}d@{ui}@{ub}
          Hexadecimal number.

    @{b}@{i}d@{ui}@{ub}
    @{b}@{i}#d@{ui}@{ub}
          Decimal number.

    @{b} %@{i}ddd@{ui}@{ub}
          Binary number.

    @{b} @@{i}d@{ui}@{ub}
    @{b} 0@{i}d@{ui}@{ub}
          Octal number.

    @{b} '@{i}c@{ui}'@{ub}
    @{b} "@{i}c@{ui}"@{ub}
          ASCII string.

     @{b}CLICalc@{ub} works in the decimal mode, meaning that you do not have to
     write the pound sign (@{b}#@{ub}) in front of each decimal number in the
     expression.

     For example:
              1> CLICalc 14*2-(33/$a)&%011010
              =$1A  =$1A  =#26  =%00000000.00000000.00000000.00011010
              ='....' =@32
              1>

     If an error had occurred while evaluating the given @{i}expression@{ui}, an
     error message is reported.  Below you find a complete list of
     possible error messages:
    @{b}calcbuffer overflow@{ub}
          This error should not occur.

    @{b}divide by zero@{ub}
          During the evaluation of the expression @{b}CLICalc@{ub} encountered a
          division by zero.  Check the expression for any division by
          zero.

    @{b}illegal value@{ub}
          The expression evaluator could not find a valid value (a
          constant or an expression).

    @{b}invalid number@{ub}
          An invalid digit was encountered in a number.  For example,
          using a @{b}2@{ub} or @{b}3@{ub} in a binary number:
                       move.l  #%1010201,d0

    @{b}missing close brackets@{ub}
          An unmatched open bracket (@{b}(@{ub}) was found in an expression.

    @{b}missing quote@{ub}
          An unmatched quote (single or double quote) was found in a
          string.  Make sure the string is correctly enclosed in quotes.
          You may not mix single and double quotes.

    @{b}not enough memory@{ub}
          There is not enough memory available for @{b}CLICalc@{ub} to complete
          its task.

    @{b}no value given@{ub}
          No term given, or the expression evaluator could not find a
          valid term.  A constant or expression might be invalid.

    @{b}overflow@{ub}
          This error is reported if an overflow occurs while evaluating
          an expression.  In other words, the result of the evaluated
          expression is larger than $ffffffff, +$7fffffff, or
          -$80000000.

    @{b}too many close brackets@{ub}
          Too many close brackets (@{b})@{ub}) are found.  Either more open
          brackets have to be inserted or the superfluous close
          brackets have to be removed to get properly balanced brackets.

StripD
------

 - Strips debugging information from a load file: StripD @{i}source@{ui} @{i}destination@{ui}
     @{b}StripD@{ub} is a small utility that removes all symbol and debug
     information from the object file given as @{i}source@{ui}.  The stripped
     file will then be written to @{i}destination@{ui}.

     The following error messages can be reported by @{b}StripD@{ub} while
     processing a file:
    @{b}couldn't open file '@{i}filename@{ui}' (DOS error: @{i}DOS error code@{ui}).@{ub}
          @{b}StripD@{ub} cannot open the specified file.  Check the spelling of
          @{i}filename@{ui} and that the supplied pathname is correct.  The @{i}DOS
          error code@{ui} may give you additional information why the
          assembler could not open the file (see @{"AmigaDOS Error Codes" Link "pro.guides/AmigaDOS Error Codes"}).

@Node "FCmp"

FCmp
----

 - File compare utility: FCMP @{i}firstfile@{ui}  @{i}secondfile@{ui}
     @{b}FCmp@{ub} is a small file compare utility that compares two given files
     and reports the first found difference.

     When a difference is found @{b}FCmp@{ub} displays an appropriate message
     that informs you at what offset the files differ.  The offset,
     relative to the start of the files, is given as a hexadecimal and
     a decimal number.

     The following messages can be reported by @{b}FCmp@{ub}:
    @{b}first difference at offset $@{i}x@{ui} (@{i}d@{ui})@{ub}
          This message is reported when a difference is found.  It
          informs you at what offset the first difference is found.
          The offset, relative to the start of the files, is given as a
          hexadecimal (@{i}x@{ui}) and as a decimal number (@{i}d@{ui}).

    @{b}length of file differs@{ub}
          When the file lengths differ @{b}FCmp@{ub} generates this message.  No
          further comparisons will be made.  Since the file lengths
          differ the files are definitely not equal.

    @{b}error reading file!@{ub}
          An error occurred while writing the source file.  Check if
          another program makes write accesses to the file.

    @{b}invalid parameter line@{ub}
          The parameter line has not the requested format.  @{b}FCmp@{ub}

Bin2DC
------

 - : Bin2DC @{i}file@{ui}  @{i}output source@{ui}  [@{i}options@{ui} ]
     @{b}Bin2DC@{ub} generates an assembler source code out of a given @{i}file@{ui}
     using the @{b}DC@{ub} directive (see @{"Initialized Data" Link "pro.guides/Initialized Data"}).  The assembler
     source is then written to @{i}output source@{ui}.

     One of the following @{i}options@{ui} can be used to format the source code:
    @{b}-b@{ub}
          Use @{b}DC.B@{ub} in the source code.

    @{b}-w@{ub}
          Use @{b}DC.W@{ub} in the source code.

    @{b}-l@{ub}
          Use @{b}DC.L@{ub} in the source code.

     @{b}DC.L@{ub} is used as default (if no @{i}option@{ui} was specified).

@Node "BDiff"

BDiff
-----

 - small binary file compare program: BDiff @{i}oldfile@{ui}  @{i}newfile@{ui}  [@{i}options@{ui} ]
     The @{b}BDiff@{ub} program determines the differences in contents between
     two files and describes these changes in a special output file
     (bdiff file).  The output file will only be generated if any
     changes were found.

     The produced bdiff file can be used later to reconstruct the
     @{i}newfile@{ui} out of the @{i}oldfile@{ui} or vice versa, except if the @{b}-s@{ub} option
     was used while these files were compared.

     @{b}BDiff@{ub} supports the following options:
    @{b}-n @{i}nnn@{ui}@{ub}
          This option sets the minimum number of bytes to @{i}nnn@{ui} that must
          be identical to be considered  a match.  By default this
          value is set to 8 bytes.

    @{b}-o @{i}filename@{ui}@{ub}
          Sends the output to the specified file (@{i}filename@{ui}).  The
          output is either a bdiff file, that contains the description
          of all differences, or the file generated out of an input and
          a bdiff file.

    @{b}-s@{ub}
          This option can be used to reduce the quantity of information
          stored in the resulting difference file.  Only the update
          information from the @{i}oldfile@{ui} to the @{i}newfile@{ui} will be stored.
          Hence only the @{i}newfile@{ui} can be reconstructed.

    @{b}-t1@{ub}
    @{b}-t2@{ub}
          @{b}BDiff@{ub} normally determines by itself which file must be
          generated out of an input file and a bdiff file.  However, if
          @{b}BDiff@{ub} aborts an operation with a @{b}file checksums are equal -
          use -t1 or -t2 option.@{ub} error message, you have to use one of
          these options to tell @{b}BDiff@{ub} what file you want to have
          generated.  @{b}-t1@{ub} forces the @{i}oldfile@{ui} to be produced and @{b}-t2@{ub} the
          @{i}newfile@{ui}.

    @{b}-u@{ub}
          This option tells @{b}BDiff@{ub} to reconstruct a file according to
          the given input file and bdiff file.  @{b}BDiff@{ub} determines by
          itself if either the former @{i}oldfile@{ui} or the former @{i}newfile@{ui} is
          to be rebuilt (see also the description of the @{b}-t1@{ub} and @{b}-t2@{ub}
          options).  Using this option, @{b}BDiff@{ub} expects the input file
          given as first argument (@{i}oldfile@{ui}) and the bdiff file as
          second argument (@{i}newfile@{ui}).  The @{b}-o@{ub} option must also be used
          to specify the resulting output file.

    @{b}-x@{ub}
          Since the generated bdiff file, that contains the
          descriptions of all differences, is no ASCII text file, you
          cannot read it using a text viewer or similar utilities.  The
          @{b}-x@{ub} option analyzes and disassembles a given bdiff file, and
          writes the output to the StdIO in an almost human readable
          format.  It looks similar to the following example:
          The first number, the hexadecimal number within the brackets,
          describes the internal code number and can be ignored.
          Offset#1 is the current offset in the first file, and
          consequently, offset#2 describes the offset in the second
          file.  The second number in the offset field is the number of
          bytes from the end of the last difference to the beginning of
          the current difference.  The length fields contain the number
          of bytes that do not match.  See at the third line of the
          example above.  There, length#1 is four and length#2 is 50
          bytes.  For example you want to generate the second file out
          of this information, this tells you that the four byte
          sequence at offset#1 has to be replaced by the 50 bytes
          starting at offset#2.

    @{b}-y @{i}nnn@{ui}@{ub}
          This sets the I/O buffer size to the value specified by @{i}nnn@{ui}.
          The default buffer size is 4096 bytes and its maximum is
          limited by the amount of available memory.

     The following error messages can be reported by @{b}BDiff@{ub}:
    @{b}couldn't open file '@{i}filename@{ui}' (@{i}DOS error code@{ui})@{ub}
          @{b}BDiff@{ub} cannot open the specified file.  Check the spelling of
          @{i}filename@{ui} and that the supplied pathname is correct.  The @{i}DOS
          error code@{ui} may give you more detailed information why the
          assembler could not open the file (see @{"AmigaDOS Error Codes" Link "pro.guides/AmigaDOS Error Codes"}).

    @{b}error occurred during processing files@{ub}
          An AmigaDOS error occurred while the files were compared.

    @{b}error occurred during writing file@{ub}
          An AmigaDOS error occurred while the output file was written.

    @{b}file checksums are equal - use -t1 or -t2 option@{ub}
          If the checksums of the former @{i}oldfile@{ui} and @{i}newfile@{ui} were
          equal, @{b}BDiff@{ub} is not capable to decide whether the @{i}oldfile@{ui} or
          the @{i}newfile@{ui} should be rebuilt.  Use the @{b}-t1@{ub} or @{b}-t2@{ub} option to
          tell @{b}BDiff@{ub} which file has to be reconstructed.

    @{b}invalid output file checksum - file may be corrupt@{ub}
          After a file is rebuilt (see @{b}-u@{ub} option), @{b}BDiff@{ub} checks its
          checksum.  An invalid checksum indicates that the produced
          file may be corrupt.  This error can occur when a wrong input
          file is given that, unfortunately, has the same checksum as
          one of the former compared input files (@{i}oldfile@{ui} or @{i}newfile@{ui}).

    @{b}invalid parameter line@{ub}
          The parameter line has not the requested format, or one or
          more unknown parameters have been encountered.  Start @{b}BDiff@{ub}
          with the question mark (@{b}?@{ub}) as only argument to get a small
          usage information displayed.

    @{b}invalid source file checksum@{ub}
          When a file has to be rebuilt, @{b}BDiff@{ub} checks the checksum of
          the input file (source file) to assure that the input file
          can be used with the given bdiff file.  Check if the correct
          source file was given.

    @{b}not a valid BDiff file@{ub}

-------

 - small binary un-bdiff: UnBDiff @{i}input file@{ui}  @{i}bdiff file@{ui}  -o@{i}output file@{ui}
     The @{b}UnBDiff@{ub} program can be used to reconstruct a file according to
     the given @{i}input file@{ui} and @{i}bdiff file@{ui}.  @{b}UnBDiff@{ub} determines by itself
     if either the former oldfile or the former newfile is to be
     rebuilt.

     @{b}UnBDiff@{ub} expects the @{i}input file@{ui} given as first argument and the
     @{i}bdiff file@{ui} file as second argument.  The @{b}-o@{ub} option must also be
     used to specify the resulting @{i}output file@{ui}.

     This utility performs the same job as @{b}BDiff @{i}input file@{ui} @{i}bdiff file@{ui}
     -u -o@{i}output file@{ui}@{ub} does (see its description above).  @{b}UnBDiff@{ub} is
     simpler to use with its fixed command line usage, and can
     therefore be useful for software and update distributions.

     The following error messages can be reported by @{b}UnBDiff@{ub}:
    @{b}couldn't open file '@{i}filename@{ui}' (@{i}DOS error code@{ui})@{ub}
          @{b}UnBDiff@{ub} cannot open the specified file.  Check the spelling
