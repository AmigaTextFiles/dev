@Node "About This Manual"

About This Manual
=================


    Welcome to the AmigaGuide version of the ASX manual.


    This manual is a part of the ProAsm manual, which was originally written
in TeX and texinfo. You are currently looking at the AmigaGuide version of
the ASX part. I used various tools to convert the primal TeX source into
AmigaGuide. They did quite a good job, but the result was over 700KBytes of
length! As a consequence I had to shorten the whole guide file by hand. Now
it is very possible that when browsing through this manual you will find
sentences like:

          @{i}This node (page) intentionally left blank.@{ui}
or
          @{i}This node (page) was intentionally shortened.@{ui}

Please forgive me for that. I had also to skip various tables that can
be found in the original printed manual.

    Caused by the convertion of the TeX source of the manual into this
AmigaGuide file and the need of some small reorganisation of it, some of
the links go nowhere. Sorry for that, but I had not the time to check all
links. I did check a lot of them, but unfortunately there are still some of
these dead links in the guide file. If you should find any, please feel
free to inform me (@{"Daniel Weber" link "Author"}).

    If you find some strange (unusal) parts in this AmigaGuide file, please
keep in mind, that this guide initially was written as a book. You can
order a copy of the printed manual, if you wish. Please read the
registration document (register.doc or @{"Registration" link "pro.guide/Registration"}) for
further information.

@Node "Introduction"

ASX - The ProAsm User Interface
===============================

    ASX  is  a user interface for the ProAsm assembler that is
implemented as a commodity.   Through the use of the
commodities.library it can be installed on any hotkey and controlled
fully with the Commodities Exchange program.

    ASX  loads  the ProAsm assembler which than can be accessed using
the ARexx interface,  the  asx.library,  or the AppIcon possibility.
The asx.library and the AppIcon can optionally be enabled or disabled.

    The  ARexx  commands  provide  a method of controlling ASX from an
external program.   These  ARexx  commands  can  be  used to create an
integrated programming/development  environment  with  any  application
that offers an ARexx  interface.  For example, a program can be written
by a programmer on its  favourite ARexx equipped texteditor, then an
ARexx command can be sent to ASX to assemble the source code.  Any
error messages and warnings of the assembly  are  stored  by  ASX.
Using commands such as NEXTERROR and PREVERROR  the  texteditor is
capable to position the cursor in the line of the  first  error.  After
correcting that error a single keystroke can jump to  the  next  error,
or  another  keystroke can jump back to the previous error.

    Another  method  of controlling ASX is the use of the optional
asx.library.  The  various functions that this library offers can be
used to design own user interfaces with ease.

    The AppIcon possibility is another visual user interface that
allows one or more source file icons to be assembled by just dropping
them over the ASX AppIcon.

    Frequently  used include files can be loaded residently and managed
by ASX.  Such  residently  loaded include files reduce assembly time
since they do not need to be loaded each time the assembler is called.

    Preferred  include file paths can be added to a database that is
managed by ASX.   During  assembly the assembler uses then this
database to know where to look for the include files.

    ASX  also  provides  a  feature  called  the source manager, which
offers a possibility  to  manage the current project per hotkey.
Through the use of an  ARexx  script file the user can easily define
the action that has to be fulfilled  when  an  entry  in the source
manager window has been selected.  Almost all shooting matches of the
source manager can be set by the user to his wishes and needs to allow
a wide range of flexibility.

    For  an  easy  use  of  ASX,  it  comes along with an on-line help
feature.  Commodore's AmigaGuide is used to display the help text to
the user.

@Node "System Requirements"

System Requirements
===================

    ASX requires Kickstart and Workbench 2.0 or higher.

@EndNode


@Remark ************************************************************************
@Node "Starting from Workbench" "pro.guide/Starting from Workbench"

Starting from Workbench
-----------------------

    The easiest way to run ASX is from the Workbench.  A double-click
on its icon loads the program.  The @{b}ENV:asx.prefs@{ub} configuration file
will be loaded and processed immediately, if not otherwise desired (see
the @{b}LOCALPREFS@{ub} tooltype below).  The configuration file is an ASCII text
that can be edited using a texteditor if needed.

    If ASX is already running and you invoke it again, it will open the
user interface window of the already running version.

    When ASX is started from the WorkBench, the following tooltypes are
recognized:
@{b}CX_PRIORITY=@{i}n@{ui}@{ub}
     Set priority of the commodity to @{i}n@{ui}.  By default, ASX uses a
     priority of 0.

@{b}CX_POPKEY=@{i}hotkey@{ui}@{ub}
     This tooltype allows you to specify the hotkey for ASX to @{i}hotkey@{ui}.
     @{i}Hotkey@{ui} must be a valid key sequence for a hotkey.  If you enter an
     incorrect description, a message will be displayed or a requester
     is opened to inform you.  (The hotkey format is described in the
     `AmigaDOS 2.0 manual').  By default, @{b}lcommand help@{ub} is used as
     hotkey.

     If you have defined a hotkey, ASX can be called up at any time by
     pressing that key sequence.

@{b}CX_POPUP=@{i}YES|NO@{ui}@{ub}
     This options allows you to select whether the user interface window
     of ASX is opened at startup or not.  @{i}YES@{ui} must be used to open the
     user interface window.  By default, ASX does not open the window.

@{b}APPICON@{ub}
     If this tooltype is selected, ASX displays an AppIcon on the
     workbench screen.  See @{"The AppIcon" Link "The AppIcon"}.

@{b}ICONX=@{i}x@{ui}@{ub}
@{b}ICONY=@{i}y@{ui}@{ub}
     These tooltypes allow you to specify the position of the AppIcon
     on the WorkBench screen relative to the top left edge.  The @{i}x@{ui} and
     @{i}y@{ui} coordinates are integer values that describe the top left
     position.

     Normally, the AppIcon will be positioned automatically in an
     appropriate position on the screen, but you may sometimes want to
     override this with your own preferred coordinates.

@{b}NOLIBRARY@{ub}
     If this tooltype is selected, ASX will not add the @{b}asx.library@{ub} to
     the system.  (See @{"The asx.library" Link "The asx.library"}).  By default, the library is
     installed.

@{b}ASMPATH=@{i}assembler@{ui}@{ub}
     Using this tooltype you can specify the location and the name of
     ProAsm.  @{i}assembler@{ui} describes the path and filename of the ProAsm
     assembler.  By default ASX searches the assembler as @{b}pro@{ub} in the
     following locations: @{b}asm:@{ub} and the current directory.

@{b}SWAP@{ub}
     This tooltype tells ASX to load ProAsm each time when used.  By
     default, the assembler is once loaded residently.  Loading the
     assembler residently can be useful on disk based systems.  This
     tooltype is also recommended on systems with little memory.

@{b}ERRFILE=@{i}filename@{ui}@{ub}
     This tooltype defines the name of the error file to @{i}filename@{ui} that
     is automatically used for all assembly task started by ASX (via
     ARexx and asx.library).

@{b}HEADERFILE=@{i}filename@{ui}@{ub}
     This tooltype defines the header @{i}filename@{ui} that is automatically
     used for all assembly task started by ASX (via ARexx and
     asx.library).

@{b}CONFIGFILE=@{i}filename@{ui}@{ub}
     This tooltype defines the configuration @{i}filename@{ui} that is
     automatically used for all assembly task started by ASX (via ARexx
     and asx.library).

@{b}NOREQ@{ub}
     If this tooltype is selected, ASX will not open any message
     requesters.  This can be useful if you do not want to be
     interrupted by these requesters.  But note that also all error
     message reported by ASX will be suppressed silently.

@{b}NORASTER@{ub}
     To get a stronger 3D-look, ASX fills the background of all its
     windows with a pattern.  If you do not want to have this pattern
     as background, you can unselect this tooltype and it will be
     written automatically to the settings file when you save settings.
     By default, a rastered background is displayed.

@{b}LOCALPREFS=@{i}filename@{ui}@{ub}
     This tooltype tells ASX to use the file @{i}filename@{ui} as configuration
     file, instead of the default configuration file named
     @{b}ENV:asx.prefs@{ub}.

@{b}NOMASTER@{ub}
     This tooltype can be used to forbid the source manager.  By
     default, the source manager is enabled.

@{b}AREXXSCRIPT=@{i}filename@{ui}@{ub}
     This tooltype allows you to specify the ARexx script that is
     executed when an entry in the source manager is selected.
     @{i}Filename@{ui} is the complete name and path of the ARexx script.
     By default, @{b}rexx:pro/sourcemanager.rexx@{ub} is used.

@{b}SMHOTKEY=@{i}hotkey@{ui}@{ub}
     This tooltype allows you to specify the hotkey for the source
     manager to @{i}hotkey@{ui}.  @{i}Hotkey@{ui} must be a valid key sequence for a
     hotkey.  If you enter an incorrect description, a message will be
     displayed or a requester is opened to inform you.  (The hotkey
     format is described in the `AmigaDOS 2.0 manual').  By default,
     @{b}lcommand shift help@{ub} is used as hotkey.

     If you have defined a hotkey, the source manager can be called up
     at any time by pressing that key sequence.

@{b}SMPUBSCREEN=@{i}screenname@{ui}@{ub}
     This tooltype can be used to specify the public screen the source
     manager should be opened on.  @{i}Screenname@{ui} is the name of the
     desired public screen.  By default, the source manager opens its
     window on the front public screen.

@{b}NOFALLBACK@{ub}
     This tooltype forbids the source manager window to open its window
     on the default public screen if the explicitly specified public
     screen is not available.  By default, the source manager does
     "fall back".

@Node "Starting from the Shell" "pro.guide/Starting from the Shell"

Starting from the Shell
-----------------------

    ASX can be started from the shell by typing its name and the
parameters you need.  Enter @{b}ASX ?@{ub} for a shell usage template.

    The @{b}ENV:asx.prefs@{ub} configuration file will be loaded and processed
immediately, if not otherwise desired (see the @{b}LOCALPREFS@{ub} argument
below).  The configuration file is an ASCII text that can be edited
using a texteditor if needed.

    If ASX is already running and you invoke it again, it will open the
user interface window of the already running version.

    There is no need to use the AmigaDOS @{b}Run@{ub} command to start ASX as it
will automatically self-detach from the shell or CLI that it was
started from.

    The command line options override the default settings of ASX.  In
the following you find a list of all command line parameters supported
by ASX.  See also see @{"Starting from Workbench" Link "Starting from Workbench"}.
@{b}CX_PRIORITY @{i}n@{ui}@{ub}
     Set priority of the commodity to @{i}n@{ui}.  By default, ASX uses a
     priority of 0.

@{b}CX_POPKEY @{i}hotkey@{ui}@{ub}
     This argument allows you to specify the hotkey for ASX to @{i}hotkey@{ui}.
     @{i}Hotkey@{ui} must be a valid key sequence for a hotkey.  If you enter an
     incorrect description, a message will be displayed or a requester
     is opened to inform you.  (The hotkey format is described in the
     `AmigaDOS 2.0 manual').  By default, @{b}lcommand help@{ub} is used as
     hotkey.

     If you have defined a hotkey, ASX can be called up at any time by
     pressing that key sequence.

@{b}CX_POPUP @{i}YES|NO@{ui}@{ub}
     This argument allows you to select if whether the user interface
     window of ASX is opened or not.  @{i}YES@{ui} must be used to open the user
     interface window.  By default, ASX does not open the window.

@{b}APPICON@{ub}
     If this argument is given, ASX displays an AppIcon on the
     workbench screen.  See @{"The AppIcon" Link "The AppIcon"}.

@{b}ICONX @{i}x@{ui}@{ub}
@{b}ICONY @{i}y@{ui}@{ub}
     These arguments allow you to specify the position of the AppIcon
     on the WorkBench screen relative to the top left edge.  The @{i}x@{ui} and
     @{i}y@{ui} coordinates are integer values that describe the top left
     position.

     Normally, the AppIcon will be positioned automatically in an
     appropriate position on the screen, but you may sometimes want to
     override this with your own preferred coordinates.

@{b}NOLIBRARY@{ub}
     If this tooltype is selected, ASX will not add the @{b}asx.library@{ub} to
     the system.  (See @{"The asx.library" Link "The asx.library"}).  By default, the library is
     installed.

@{b}ASMPATH @{i}assembler@{ui}@{ub}
     this argument allows you to specify the location and the name of
     ProAsm.  @{i}assembler@{ui} describes the path and filename of the ProAsm

@Node "The User Interface" "pro.guide/The User Interface"

The User Interface
------------------

    This section describes the user interface of ASX.  As user
interface, ASX presents six different windows and an AppIcon.
Everything in these windows should be fairly self-explanatory.  If ASX
is started from the Workbench or the command line, no window will be
opened except the @{b}CX_POPUP=YES@{ub} tooltype or command line option was
selected.  The window can also be opened by using the hotkey, the
@{b}Exchange@{ub} program that comes along with the Workbench 2.0 or higher, or
by starting ASX again.

    A window opened by ASX can present itself in two different forms.
A large window occupying nearly one third of a normal 640x400 Workbench
screen, and a `zoomed' window, where only the close gadget, the zoom
gadget, the depth gadget, and the window title are visible.  If you
click the zoom gadget, ASX's window will toggle between the large and
the `zoomed' window.

    When using ASX, you may get in contact with one or more of the
following basic types of gadgets:
@{b}action@{ub}
     Action-gadgets appear as raised buttons.  Normally the buttons are
     labeled with a small text that is written inside the gadget.
     Selecting such a button causes an immediate action.  For example,
     the @{b}Quit@{ub} gadget in the main window causes ASX to quit.

@{b}list@{ub}
@{b}listview@{ub}
     Generally list-gadgets appear as a set of control gadgets.  A
     small scrollbar, arrow gadgets, and a string area.  ASX may have
     additional control gadgets attached to its list-gadgets.  These
     gadgets are a string-gadget, an add-gadget (in one case),
     del-gadget, a select-gadget, top-, up-, down-, bottom-, and a
     sort-gadget.  Use the scroll bar and the arrow gadgets to position
     the scrolling area to a specific entry.  To add new entries to the
     list, select the add- or select-gadget (if available) or type the
     new entry name into the string-gadget (below the scroll area) and
     press RETURN.  Entries can be removed from the list by selecting
     the entry to be cleared in the scroll area (to copy its name into
     the string-gadget), and selecting the del-gadget.

     The top-, up-, down-, and a bottom-gadget can be used to move the
     entry to the desired position in the list.  Top and bottom move
     the item directly to either the top end or the bottom end of the
     list. Up and down move the selected item one position upwards or
     downwards in the list.  The sort-gadget sorts all entries in the
     list alphabetically.  Some gadgets can be disabled if they cannot
     be used (e.g. on empty lists).

@{b}string@{ub}
     String-gadgets appear as raised ridge around a text area.  Any
     string can be entered by clicking (activating) within the text area
     and typing your string.  When you have finished typing, press the
     RETURN key to confirm or the TAB key to confirm and jump to the
     next string-gadget.

@{b}check@{ub}
     Check-gadgets appear as small rectangular raised buttons, with
     labeled with a text on the left or the right side of the gadget.
     When the gadget is selected, a small checkmark appears, or

The Main Window
...............

    This is the main window that shows up when ASX's user interface is
opened.  From here you can access the additional windows or handle the
ASX concerning settings.

The Gadgets
...........

@{b}Assembler@{ub}
     By clicking on this gadget, you will switch to the assembler
     settings window.  See @{"The Assembler Window" Link "The_Assembler_Window"}.

@{b}IncDir@{ub}
     Go to the IncDir window.  There you can specify the directories
     where the assembler has to search for include files.  See
     @{"The IncDir Window" Link "The_IncDir_Window"}.

@{b}Residents@{ub}
     By the selection of this gadget you will switch to the residents
     settings window.  See @{"The Residents Window" Link "The_Residents_Window"}.

@{b}Sources@{ub}
     Selecting this gadget switches to the source manager preference
     window.  See @{"The Source Manager Preferences Window" Link "The_Source_Manager_Preferences_Window"}.

@{b}running assembly jobs@{ub}
     This listview-gadget shows all running jobs.  A job is represented
     by its ARexx port name and its ID.  See @{"The ARexx Interface" Link "The ARexx Interface"}, for
     the description of the @{b}DefineID@{ub}, the @{b}FindID@{ub}, and the @{b}GetPort@{ub}
     commands.

@{b}asx.library@{ub}
     This gadget can be used to control the use of the asx.library.  If
     it is checked (selected) the asx.library is installed.  See
     @{"The asx.library" Link "The asx.library"}.

@{b}AppIcon@{ub}
     If this check-gadget is selected an AppIcon is put on the
     Workbench screen.  See @{"The AppIcon" Link "The AppIcon"}.

@{b}Hot Key@{ub}
     This allows you to select what key sequence is used to open the
     ASX main window when it is hidden, by entering the key description
     into the string gadget.  Any standard commodities key description
     can be given.  If you enter an incorrect description, a message
     will be displayed or a requester is opened to inform you.  (The
     hotkey format is described in the `AmigaDOS 2.0 manual').  By
     default, @{b}lcommand help@{ub} is used as hotkey.

     If you have defined a hotkey, ASX can be called up at any time by
     pressing that key sequence.

@{b}Save@{ub}
     Stores the current settings to @{b}ENVARC:asx.prefs@{ub} and @{b}ENV:asx.prefs@{ub}.

@{b}Hide@{ub}
     This function closes the ASX user interface, but leaves ASX
     installed in the background.  This allows you to have ASX
     constantly available, while using the minimum amount of memory
     possible.

     You can also hide ASX by clicking on the close gadget of the
     window.

@{b}Quit@{ub}
     This function tells ASX to exit.  Usually, ASX can quit
     immediately.  However, sometimes when you try to quit, another
     program has not ended the ARexx job or closed the asx.library.  A
     requester will inform you by displaying the number of jobs that
     are still unfinished yet and ASX refuses to quit.

The Menus
.........

    Frequently used menu items in ASX have keyboard equivalents so that
you can use them without having to move from the keyboard to the mouse
if you don't want to.  The keyboard equivalents are not case sensitive.

    Menu items that have a sequence of dots following the item name
open a requester as part of their execution.  Items with a question
mark (@{b}?@{ub}) indicate that they use a checkmark to show that their
associated mode is active.

@{b}Project@{ub}
      


    @{b}Open...@{ub}
            The @{b}Open...@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-O@{ub}) command allows you to
          load an existing configuration file using a file requester.



    @{b}Save@{ub}
            The @{b}Save@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-S@{ub}) command stores the current
          settings to @{b}ENVARC:asx.prefs@{ub} and @{b}ENV:asx.prefs@{ub}.



    @{b}Save as...@{ub}
            The @{b}Save as...@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-A@{ub}) command is very
          similar to the @{b}Save@{ub} command. It allows you to store
          the current settings to a user specified file.  A file
          requester is opened that allows you to specify
          the name of the file the configuration is written to.  The
          file requester will always appear with this command,
          whereas  the  @{b}Save@{ub}  command  will  assume the predefined
          names.



    @{b}About...@{ub}
            The @{b}About@{ub} selection will display the copyright and
          version notice for ASX, and some information about the used
          assembler.



    @{b}Help...@{ub}
            This @{b}Help@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-?@{ub}) command pops up a brief
          description of the main window.  ASX uses the
          AmigaGuide for a context-sensitive on-line manual.



    @{b}Hide@{ub}
            The @{b}Hide@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-H@{ub}) menu item closes the ASX user
          interface,   but leaves ASX installed in the background. This
          allows you to have ASX constantly available, while using the
          minimum amount of memory possible.



    @{b}Quit@{ub}
            The @{b}Quit@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-Q@{ub}) menu item tells ASX to exit.
          Usually, ASX can quit immediately.  However,
          sometimes when you try to quit, another program has
          not ended the ARexx job or closed the asx.library.  A
          requester will inform you by displaying the number of jobs
          that are still unfinished yet and ASX refuses to quit.

@{b}Window@{ub}
      


    @{b}SnapShot Window@{ub}
            This command tells ASX to remember the current window
          position.  The window will appear in the new position the
          next time it is opened.

    @{b}UnSnapShot Window@{ub}
            This command is the opposite of @{b}SnapShot Window@{ub}.  It
          flushes the previously stored window position.

    @{b}Rastered Background?@{ub}
            To get a stronger 3D-look, ASX fills the background of
          all windows with a pattern.  If you do not want to have this
          pattern as background, you can unselect this menu item and it
          will be written automatically to the settings file
          when you save settings.  By default, this menu item is
          selected.



@{b}Settings@{ub}
      


    @{b}Assembler@{ub}
            The @{b}Assembler@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-E@{ub}) menu item lets you switch
          over to the assembler settings window.  See
          @{"The Assembler Window" Link "The_Assembler_Window"}.



    @{b}Incdir@{ub}
            This @{b}IncDir@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-I@{ub}) command changes to the
          IncDir window.  See @{"The IncDir Window" Link "The_IncDir_Window"}.



    @{b}Residents@{ub}
            This @{b}Residents@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-R@{ub}) command switches to the
          residents settings window.  See @{"The Residents Window" Link "The_Residents_Window"}.



    @{b}Sources@{ub}
            This  @{b}Sources@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-M@{ub}) menu item switches to the
          source manager preference window.  See
          @{"The Source Manager Preferences Window" Link "The_Source_Manager_Preferences_Window"}.

The Assembler Window
....................

    Here you can specify some global assembler settings, that are
automatically used when ASX is used to assemble a source code.

    All string gadgets in this window are connected to a @{b}Select@{ub} gadget.
This gadget opens a file requester allowing the desired file to be
chosen.  The selected file name will instantly be written to the string
gadget.

The Gadgets
...........

@{b}ProAsm path@{ub}
     Here you can specify the path of the ProAsm assembler.  By default
     ASX searches the assembler as @{b}pro@{ub} in the following locations: @{b}asm:@{ub}
     and the current directory.  Note that if you select a new
     assembler, you have to use @{b}Reload@{ub} to force ASX to load it.  @{b}Reload@{ub}
     does not have to be used if the @{b}Swap Assembler@{ub} gadget is set.

@{b}Reload@{ub}
     This gadget forces ASX to reload a new selected assembler.  This
     command must be performed if a new assembler is selected and the
     @{b}Swap Assembler@{ub} is not set.

@{b}Swap Assembler@{ub}
     If this check-gadget is selected the assembler is loaded each time
     when used.  By default, the assembler is once loaded residently.
     Loading the assembler residently can be useful on disk based
     systems.  This tooltype is also recommended on system with little
     memory.

@{b}Header file@{ub}
     Using this string gadget you can define the header file that is
     automatically used for all assembly tasks started by ASX (via
     ARexx and asx.library).

@{b}Error file@{ub}
     Using this string gadget you can define the error file that is
     automatically used for all assembly tasks started by ASX (via
     ARexx and asx.library).

@{b}Config file@{ub}
     Using this string gadget you can define the configuration file
     that is automatically used for all assembly tasks started by ASX
     (via ARexx and asx.library).

The Residents Window
....................

    Through this interface, you have the possibility to load include
files residently.  The assembler, run by ASX, can later access these
files without the need of loading them again.  Residently loaded
include files speed up your assembly time but reduce the memory.

The Gadgets
...........

@{b}The listview gadget@{ub}
     This gadget shows you the list of all files that are currently
     kept in memory by ASX.  Use the scroll bar and the arrow gadgets
     to position the scrolling area to a specific entry.  By selecting

The Source Manager Preferences Window
.....................................

    The source manager preferences window offers various settings to
configure the source manager (see @{"The Source Manager Window" Link "The Source Manager Window"}).

The Gadgets
...........

@{b}The Sources ListView-Gadget@{ub}
     This listview-gadget shows you a list of all entries that are
     currently stored by ASX.  All these entries will also be shown by
     the source manager.  Use the scroll bar and the arrow gadgets to
     position the scrolling area to a specific entry.  By selecting an
     entry in the scroll area of the listview gadget its name is copied
     to the string-gadget directly below.

     See @{"The User Interface" Link "The User Interface"}, for more information about a
     listview-gadget and how to handle it.  New to this listview-gadget
     is, that it has a @{b}Sort@{ub} gadget attached to it.  This gadget can be
     used to sort all entries in alphabetical order.

     An entry is a simple string that is later used by the ARexx script
     (see below).

@{b}The Public Screen Names ListView-Gadget@{ub}
     This listview-gadgets shows all currently opened public screens
     plus @{b}<front PubScreen>@{ub} as first entry.  Below the listview-gadget
     is a string-gadget that contains the name of the selected public
     screen.  Use the scroll bar and the arrow gadgets to position the
     scrolling area to a specific entry.  By selecting an entry in the
     scroll area of the listview gadget its name is copied to the
     string-gadget directly below.

     The source manager can be limited to be opened on only one public
     screen by selecting the desired screen.  If @{b}<front PubScreen>@{ub} is
     selected, the source manager will popup on the front public screen.
     Which, in the most cases, will be the screen of the program you
     currently work with.

@{b}fall back@{ub}
     When this check-gadget is selected, the source manager window does
     "fall back" to open its window on the default public screen if the
     explicitly specified public screen is not available.  Otherwise
     the source manager does silently abort.

@{b}ARexx Script@{ub}
     These gadgets allow you to specify the ARexx script that is
     executed when an entry in the source manager is selected (see
     @{"The Source Manager Window" Link "The Source Manager Window"}).  This can be done by either entering
     the name and the complete path into the string gadget, or by
     selecting the @{b}Select@{ub} gadget.  The @{b}Select@{ub} gadget opens a file
     requester with whom the desired script can be selected more easily.

     When an entry is selected using the source manager (see
     @{"The Source Manager Window" Link "The Source Manager Window"}), its string and the name of the public
     screen the window is opened on are passed to the ARexx script as
     arguments.  The public screen name can be used to determine the
     program the source manager is used from.  You can use the @{b}PARSE@{ub}
     command of ARexx to put the arguments into ARexx variables.
     Consider the following example:
          /* ARexx programs must start with a comment */
              OPTIONS RESULTS
              PARSE ARG source,pubscreen   /* get the arguments */
     In the above example the @{b}source@{ub} variable contains the selected
     string and @{b}pubscreen@{ub} the public screen name.  Look at the sample
     script file @{b}SourceManager.rexx@{ub} for an example how the source
     manger can be used.

     By default, @{b}rexx:pro/sourcemanager.rexx@{ub} is used as script.

@{b}enabled@{ub}
     Using this check-gadget you can control the allowance of the
     source manager.  If selected the source manager is enabled and its
     window will be opened when its hotkey is pressed.  By default, the
     source manager is enabled.

@{b}Hot Key@{ub}
     This allows you to select what key sequence is used to open the
     source manager window, by entering the key description into the
     string gadget.  Any standard commodities key description can be
     given.  If you enter an incorrect description, a message will be
     displayed or a requester is opened to inform you.  (The hotkey
     format is described in the `AmigaDOS 2.0 manual').  By default,
     @{b}lcommand shift help@{ub} is used as hotkey.

     If you have defined a hotkey, the source manager can be called up
     at any time by pressing that key sequence.

@{b}Done@{ub}
     This action gadget toggles back to the main window.

The Menus
.........

    The source manager preferences window has the following five menu
items:
@{b}Add source@{ub}
     The @{b}Add source@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-A@{ub}) command allows you to add a file name to
     the list of source codes using a file requester.

@{b}Delete source@{ub}
     The @{b}Delete@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-D@{ub})command deletes the selected entry.  An entry
     can be selected by entering its name into the string gadget, or by
     selecting the desired entry in the scroll area of the `Sources'
     listview-gadget.

@{b}Flush source@{ub}
     This command deletes all entries in the `Sources' list.

@{b}Help@{ub}
     The @{b}Help@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-?@{ub}) command pops up a brief description of the
     source manager preferences window.  ASX uses the AmigaGuide for a
     context-sensitive on-line manual.

@{b}Done@{ub}
     The @{b}Done@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-X@{ub}) command toggles back to the main window.

@Node "The Source Manager Window" "pro.guide/The Source Manager Window"

The Source Manager Window
.........................

    The source manager provides a small project manager for a
programming/development environment.  Using the source manager you can
handle your current projects in a very easy way.  The interface between
the manager and the application program builds an ARexx script.  An
ARexx script has the advantage that it allows also more than one
application to be managed, even applications without an ARexx interface.

    The source manager window is probably the simplest window.  It pops
up on the specified or on the front most public screen when you pressed
the source manager hotkey defined in the source manager preferences
window (see @{"The Source Manager Window" Link "The Source Manager Window"}).  Note that the window of the
source manager can only be opened on public screens (see
@{"The Source Manager Preferences Window" Link "The_Source_Manager_Preferences_Window"}).  The window presents itself
only with a listview-gadget, a window close-gadget, and a menu.

The Gadgets
...........

@{b}The ListView-Gadget@{ub}
     The listview-gadget contains the same entries as defined in the
     source manager preferences (see @{"The Source Manager Window" Link "The Source Manager Window"}).  When
     an entry is selected, by either a doubleclick or the RETURN key,
     the specified ARexx script is executed with the selected entry and
     the name of the public screen as arguments.  For more details
     about this ARexx script and the argument passing, see
     @{"The Source Manager Window" Link "The Source Manager Window"}.

@{b}The Window Close-Gadget@{ub}
     Select this gadget to cancel.  It also closes the source manager
     window.

The Keyboard
............

    The source manager window is also keyboard controllable:
@{b}up and down arrow keys@{ub}
     You may use this keys to select an entry.  They have the same
     function as the small up and down arrow-gadgets attached to the
     listview-gadget.

@{b}RETURN@{ub}
@{b}ENTER@{ub}
     One of these keys can be used to execute the ARexx script with the
     selected entry and the public screen name the window is opened on
     as arguments.  In their function, they are identical to a
     double-click on the selected entry.

@{b}ESC@{ub}
     Press the @{b}ESC@{ub} key to cancel.  It also closes the source manager
     window.

@{b}Hotkey@{ub}
     Pressing the hotkey while the source manager window is open, the
     window is forced to the front, and it will be activated.

The Menu
........

    The source manager window has a very short menu.  The only menu
item is @{b}CANCEL@{ub}.

    The @{b}CANCEL@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-C@{ub}) command closes the source manager window and
cancels the operation.


@EndNode

@Node "The AppIcon" "pro.guide/The AppIcon"

The AppIcon
...........

    If the @{b}AppIcon@{ub} gadget in the main window is selected, an AppIcon is
displayed on the Workbench screen.  If ASX was started from Workbench,
the AppIcon has the same icon as ASX.  Otherwise the built in icon is
used.

    The operations that can be performed with the AppIcon are very easy:
@{b}Show Interface@{ub}
     A double-click on the icon forces ASX to open the main window when
     it is hidden.  It has the same effect as pressing the ASX's hotkey.

@{b}Assemble Files@{ub}
     Just select one or more file icons (no drawers) on the Workbench,
     drag them to the ASX AppIcon and drop them.  ASX will then
     assemble one file after the other.  Note that no report window is
     opened to observe the assembly progress.  Use the @{b}ERRFILE@{ub} directive
     (see @{"The Error File" Link "The Error File"}, for its description) to let the assembler
     generate error files that can be looked at later.

programs.  ASX has an ARexx interface built into it that allows external
programs to control ASX.  The commands offered by ASX can  be  used to
create an integrated programming/development  environment  with  any
ARexx equipped application.

    If you want to send commands from an ARexx equipped program to ASX,
ARexx has to be informed.  This is done using the @{b}ADDRESS@{ub} command:
             ADDRESS 'asx_rexx'

    Be aware that case is important.  ARexx will not find the port if
the name is not spelled correctly.



An ARexx Example
................

    Here is a small example ARexx program that talks to ASX.  In the
following example all plain ARexx commands are written in upper case,
and the ASX ARexx commands in mixed case: For a description of the
plain ARexx commands refer to the `AmigaDOS manual'.

     /* ARexx programs must start with a comment */
     
     OPTIONS RESULTS
     PARSE ARG SourceFile,OutputFile     /* get arguments */
     ADDRESS 'asx_rexx'                  /* talk to ASX */
     
     BeginAssembly                       /* start an ASX Daemon Task */
     DaemonPort = RESULT
     
     IF DaemonPort~='' THEN DO
             ADDRESS (''||DaemonPort)    /* now talk to the daemon task */
             DefineID 'foo'              /* optionally define an ID */
             Assemble SourceFile -o OutputFile -w /* Assemble... */
     END
     
     EXIT(0)

    For more sophisticated examples see the ARexx scripts that come
along with ASX.

ARexx Commands
..............

    This section lists all ARexx commands of ASX in alphabetical order,
with their syntax, arguments, and result descriptions.

    The ARexx commands of ASX have the following general format.  The
name of the command comes first, followed by one or more arguments if
required.  Arguments in square brackets are optional.

    All ASX commands when called from ARexx respond by setting two
variables: the @{b}RC@{ub} (the error status code) variable and the @{b}RESULT@{ub}
variable.  @{b}RC@{ub} contains an integer value that indicates the severity of
an error:

  0     No error occurred.

  5     A warning only.

  10    Something went wrong.

  20    Complete or severe failure occurred.


    @{b}RESULT@{ub} contains the result of the command if a result is returned.
@{b}RESULT@{ub} can be a string or an integer value according to the called
command.  Before using a command that returns a result, it is important
to turn on results with the @{b}option results@{ub} command.  After this command
has been executed, any results returned by ASX or the daemon task will
be in the @{b}RESULT@{ub} variable.

    Following you find the description of all ARexx commands that have
to be send to the ASX ARexx interface (@{b}asx_rexx@{ub}).




ARexx Commands Overview
.......................

 - : AddIncDir @{i}path@{ui}
     This command adds the specified @{i}path@{ui} to the list of pathes stored
     in ASX.  A @{i}path@{ui} name containing one or more whitespaces must be
     enclosed in double or single quotes.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          True (1) if succeeded, false (0) otherwise.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}RemIncDir@{ub} and @{b}FlushIncDir@{ub}.

 - : AddResident @{i}file@{ui}
     This command loads the specified @{i}file@{ui} to ASX's resident list.  A
     @{i}file@{ui} name containing one or more whitespace must be enclosed in
     double or single quotes.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}RemResident@{ub} and @{b}FlushResident@{ub}.

 - : AddSource @{i}string@{ui}
     This command adds the name of the specified @{i}string@{ui} to the source
     name list of ASX's source manager.  A @{i}string@{ui} name containing one
     or more whitespace must be enclosed in double or single quotes.

     Note that @{i}string@{ui} can be a string of any format.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}RemSource@{ub}, @{b}FlushSource@{ub}.

 - : BegOfAssembly
     This command starts a new daemon process that awaits assembly jobs.
     @{b}BegOfAssembly@{ub} must be used before any source code can be assembled.

     The following example shows the use of the @{b}BegOfAssembly@{ub} command
     and the addressing of the new created task:
                  ADDRESS 'asx_rexx'
                  BegOfAssembly
                  daemon = RESULT
                  ...
                  ADDRESS (''||daemon)    /* ARexx weirdness */
                  ...
          	  EndOfAssembly
     Note the strange argument of the second @{b}ADDRESS@{ub} command.  To
     address the new created daemon task, the result of the
     @{b}BegOfAssembly@{ub} command must be used as argument of the @{b}ADDRESS@{ub}
     command.  Either as @{b}ADDRESS VALUE @{i}port@{ui}@{ub}, or due to a ARexx
     weirdness, the argument can have the following format: @{b}("||@{i}port@{ui})@{ub}.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          ARexx port name of the new created daemon task.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}EndOfAssembly@{ub}.

 - : DisableFallBack
     This command forbids the "fall back" mode for the source manager
     window.  If "fall back" is disabled, the source manager silently
     aborts if its window cannot be opened on the explicitly specified
     public screen.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}EnableFallBack@{ub}.

 - : DisableManager
     This command can be used to disable the source manager via ARexx.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}EnableManager@{ub}.

 - : EnableFallBack
     This command enables the "fall back" mode for the source manager
     window.  If "fall back" is enabled, the source manager window
     opens its window on the default public screen if the explicitly
     specified public screen is not available.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}DisableFallBack@{ub}

 - : EnableManager
     This is the opposite of the @{b}DisableManager@{ub} command and it can be
     used to enable the source manager via ARexx.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}DisableManager@{ub}.

 - : FindID @{i}idstring@{ui}
     This command searches the daemon process spawned by ASX which
     carries @{i}idstring@{ui} as its ID.  An ID can be specified for a daemon
     process using the @{b}DefineID@{ub} command.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}DefineID@{ub} and @{b}GetID@{ub}.

 - : FlushIncDir
     This command deletes all entries in the include directory list
     stored in ASX.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}AddIncDir@{ub} and @{b}RemIncDir@{ub}.

 - : FlushResident
     This command deletes all residently loaded include files in the
     ASX's resident list.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}AddResident@{ub} and @{b}RemResident@{ub}.

 - : FlushSource
     This command deletes all entries in the source name list of ASX's
     source manager.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}AddSource@{ub} and @{b}RemSource@{ub}.

 - : GetPort @{i}num@{ui}
     This command returns the name of port number @{i}num@{ui}.  This command
     seems to be a bit strange, since you do not know the port sequence.
     The @{b}GetPort@{ub} command is merely implemented to have a possibility to
     walk through the port list and to access all ports, even the
     unknown ones.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          Name of the port or an empty string, if the port could not be
          found.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : Hide
     The @{b}Hide@{ub} command closes the ASX user interface if opened, but
     leaves ASX installed in the background.  This allows you to have
     ASX constantly available, while using the minimum amount of memory
     possible.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : IsIncDir @{i}path@{ui}
     The @{b}IsIncDir@{ub} command searches the given @{i}path@{ui} in the include
     directory list stored in ASX.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          A true (1) value is returned if @{i}path@{ui} could be found in the
          list. Otherwise a false (0) is returned.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : IsResident @{i}file@{ui}
     This command searches for the given @{i}file@{ui} in the list of residently
     loaded include files.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          True (1) is returned when the search was successful.
          Otherwise false (0) is returned.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : IsSource @{i}string@{ui}
     The @{b}IsSource@{ub} command searches for the given @{i}string@{ui} in the source
     name list of ASX's source manager.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          True (1) is returned when the search was successful.
          Otherwise false (0) is returned.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : IsThereError
     The @{b}IsThereError@{ub} returns the port name of the next daemon process
     with a non-empty error list.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          Daemon's port name or an empty string if no daemon process
          could be found.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : IsTherePort
     This command returns the port name of the next demon process.
     This command can be used to traverse through the complete daemon
     port list.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          Daemon's port name or an empty string if no daemon process
          could be found.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : Quit
     This command tells ASX to exit.  Usually, ASX can quit immediately.
     However, sometimes when you try to quit, another program has not
     ended the ARexx job or closed the asx.library yet.  In such a case,
     ASX refuses to quit.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : RemIncDir @{i}path@{ui}
     This command removes the specified @{i}path@{ui} from the list of pathes
     stored in ASX.  A @{i}path@{ui} name containing one or more whitespace must
     be enclosed in double or single quotes.  If the given @{i}path@{ui} is not
     in the list, the operation will be ignored silently.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}AddIncDir@{ub} and @{b}FlushIncDir@{ub}.

 - : RemResident @{i}file@{ui}
     This command removes the specified @{i}file@{ui} from the resident list.  A
     @{i}file@{ui} name containing one or more whitespace must be enclosed in
     double or single quotes.  If the given @{i}file@{ui} is not in the list,
     the operation will be ignored silently.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}AddResident@{ub} and @{b}FlushResident@{ub}.

 - : RemSource @{i}string@{ui}
     This command removes the specified @{i}string@{ui} from the source name
     list of ASX's source manager.  A @{i}string@{ui} name containing one or
     more whitespace must be enclosed in double or single quotes.  If
     the given @{i}string@{ui} is not in the list, the operation will be ignored
     silently.

     Note that @{i}string@{ui} can be a string of any format.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}AddSource@{ub} and @{b}FlushSource@{ub}.

 - : SetARexxScript @{i}filename@{ui}
     This command specifies the ARexx script that is executed when an
     entry in the source manager is selected.  @{i}Filename@{ui} is the name of
     the ARexx script file.  The @{i}filename@{ui} must be enclosed in double or
     single quotes if it contains any whitespaces.

 - : SetPubScreen @{i}ScreenName@{ui}
     This command can be used to specify the name of the public screen
     on which the source manager should open its window.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}EnableFallBack@{ub}.

 - : Status @{i}number@{ui}
     This command allows you to find out the values of the 21 internal
     variables of ASX.

     Some of the variables whose values are returned hold a true (1) or
     false value (0).  Those that return true or false values have a
     question mark (@{b}?@{ub}) after them in the table below.  Other variables
     return numbers or strings.

     The given @{i}number@{ui} argument specifies the number of the internal
     variable you want information on.  Valid @{i}numbers@{ui} currently range
     from 0 to 21.  Following you find a list of all the internal
     variables and their numbers:
    @{b}0@{ub}
          This returns the version string of ASX.

    @{b}1@{ub}
          The number of jobs running.

          Contents of the desired internal variable.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.




ARexx Commands Overview For The Daemon Process
..............................................

    Following you find all ARexx commands that have to be send to the
daemon process that is spawned by the @{b}BegOfAssembly@{ub} command (see also
@{b}BegOfAssembly@{ub}).  Such a demon process must be started, before any
source code can be assembled.  Consider the following example that
starts such a daemon process:
             ADDRESS 'asx_rexx'
             BegOfAssembly
             daemon=port
             ...
             ADDRESS (''||daemon)    /* ARexx weirdness */
     	     ...
     	     EndOfAssembly

 - : Assemble @{i}arguments@{ui}
     This command executes the ProAsm assembler.  @{i}Arguments@{ui} can be any
     of the command line arguments supported by ProAsm.  For the
     @{i}argument@{ui} syntax the same syntax rules are valid as for the command
     line.

     A few texteditors have the possibility to return the start address
     of the source code in memory.  In this case you may use the
     @{b}-A@{ub}/@{b}ADDRESS@{ub} command line argument of ProAsm.  For example:
                  Assemble ADDRESS the_start_address
                  asmresult = RESULT
     Using another editor, that does not support this feature, you can
     cause the editor to save a temporary file that is assembled.  The
     temporary file can then be deleted after the assembly is done.
     For example:
                  Assemble the_temp_file
                  asmresult = RESULT
                  ADDRESS COMMAND "c:delete "||the_temp_file

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          The @{b}RESULT@{ub} variable contains the message string returned by
          the assembler.  The strings informs you about the number of
          errors (@{b}E@{ub}), warnings (@{b}W@{ub}), and optimizations encountered (@{b}O@{ub}).
          It informs you likewise about the number of bytes saved by
          optimizations (the second value succeeding the (@{b}O@{ub}) in the
          format string), the code size (@{b}C@{ub}), and the workspace used (@{b}S@{ub}).
          In general, it is the same message that is displayed in the
          shell after the assembler has finished its job.  The returned
          string is of the following format:
               E @{i}num@{ui} W @{i}num@{ui} C @{i}num@{ui} O @{i}num@{ui} @{i}num@{ui} S @{i}num@{ui}

          You can use the @{b}PARSE@{ub} command of ARexx to split the message
          in various parts and put the different values into ARexx
          variables:
                Assemble foo
                PARSE VAR RESULT . err . warn . opt obytes . size . spc
                /* Where:
                    err:    #of errors
                    warn:   #of warning messages
                    opt:    #of optimizations encountered
                    obytes: #of bytes saved by optimizations
                    size:   code size in bytes
                    spc:    used workspace (in bytes)
                */
          The values are stored in the different variables in the same
          order as described above.  Refer to the `AmigaDOS manual' for
          the description of the ARexx commands.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

 - : DefineID
     This command allows you to define an ID string to mark your
     assembly job.  Usually this is used to identify a
     programming/development environment.

     For example:
                  ADDRESS 'asx_rexx'
                  FindID 'TextEditor'
                  port = result
                  DO WHILE port~=''
                    ADDRESS (''||port)
                    EndOfAssembly         /* quit all open jobs */
                    ADDRESS 'asx_rexx'
                    FindID 'TextEditor'
                    port = result
                  END
          
                  BegOfAssembly           /* begin a new job    */
                  port = result
          
                  IF port~='' THEN DO
                    ADDRESS (''||port)    /* ARexx weirdness    */
                    DefineID 'TextEditor' /* set ID             */
                    ...
                  END
     The ARexx fragment above shows you a possible use of the @{b}DefineID@{ub}
     and @{b}FindID@{ub} commands.  The examples assume a
     programming/development environment that allows only one ARexx
     script, one job respectively, to be executed at the time.  The
     example can easily be extended to do the same for more than one
     source code.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}FindID@{ub} and @{b}GetID@{ub}.

 - : EndOfAssembly
     This command tells ASX that the current assembly job is finished.
     The daemon process is then quitted, and all the memory and
     resources used is returned to the system.

     The @{b}EndOfAssembly@{ub} command should be used if the job has finished
     and the error list managed by ASX is not used anymore.  In a
     programming/development  environment this may have to be managed
     differently.  You can define the same ID for all assembly jobs
     started by this environment (using the @{b}DefineID@{ub} command), and then
     instead of quitting each job separately, you can write a function
     that quits all jobs at once.  This has the advantage that the
     error lists stored by ASX are still available until all jobs are
     ended.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          None.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}BefOfAssembly@{ub}.

 - : FirstError
     This command returns the first error or warning message reported
     by ProAsm to ASX.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          Error or warning message.  If neither an error nor a warning
          message is reported, an empty string is returned.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}NextError@{ub} and @{b}PrevError@{ub}.

 - : GetID
     The @{b}GetID@{ub} command returns the ID string of the current assembly
     job.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          ID string.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}DefineID@{ub} and @{b}FindID@{ub}.

 - : NextError
     This command returns the next error or warning message in the
     error list reported by ProAsm.  @{b}NextError@{ub} begins with the first
     reported message, except the @{b}FirstError@{ub} command was executed
     before.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          Error or warning message.  An empty string is returned, if
          the end of the message list has been reached.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

     See also @{b}FirstError@{ub} and @{b}PrevError@{ub}.

 - : PrevError
     This command returns the previous error or warning message in the
     error list reported by ProAsm.

    @{b}RESULT@{ub}
          Error or warning message.  An empty string is returned, if
          the start of the message list has been reached.

    @{b}RC@{ub}
          Error status code.

@Node "The asx.library" "pro.guide/The asx.library"

The @{b}asx.library@{ub}
---------------

    With the @{b}asx.library@{ub} you have access on the basic capabilities of
ASX: assemble, manage the residently loaded files, include pathes, and
the sources from the source manager.

    This library is added to the system only when the asx.library
gadget in the main window of ASX is selected.  This can be done by
using the graphical user interface, or , at startup, by suppressing the
@{b}NOLIBRARY@{ub} command line argument, tooltype respectively (the library is
installed by default).

    Using the library function, you can build your own user interface
for ProAsm.  These library functions are quite similar to their ARexx
equivalent.

    In the following you find an alphabetical list of all @{b}asx.library@{ub}
functions:

 - : asx_Assemble()
                   result := asx_Assemble(ArgStr, SpecialList)

                    d0                     a0,        a1


     The @{b}asx_Assemble()@{ub} function executes the ProAsm assembler, with
     the @{i}ArgStr@{ui} and the @{i}SpecialList@{ui} as Arguments.

    Input:
         @{b}a0@{ub}
               @{i}ArgStr@{ui} - is a pointer to the command line arguments.
               Any command line arguments supported by ProAsm will be
               accepted.  For Example:
                            lea     ArgStr(pc),a0
                            ...
                    ArgStr: DC.B    "-W -F",0
                            EVEN

         @{b}a1@{ub}
               @{i}SpecialList@{ui} - refer to @{b}asx.i@{ub} for further information
               about this structure.  To work properly, only two fields
               must be set: the @{b}ax_Source@{ub} and @{b}ax_StdOut@{ub} field.

    Result:
         @{b}d0@{ub}
               This register contains a boolean value whether the
               function succeeded (true) or not (false).  The result of
               the assembly, if succeeded, is returned in the
               @{b}ax_Errors@{ub}, @{b}ax_Warnings@{ub}, @{b}...@{ub} fields of the
               @{i}SpecialList@{ui}.

     Take also a look at the @{b}Pro68.s@{ub} source code as an example for the
     use of this function.

 - : asx_AddIncDir()
                          result := asx_AddIncDir(path)

               @{i}path@{ui} -  pointer to a pathname that should be stored by
               ASX.  ASX makes a copy of the supplied pathname.

    Result:
         @{b}d0@{ub}
               A boolean value is returned: true if succeeded, false
               (0) otherwise.
