              Registration Information for the ProAsm package
              -----------------------------------------------



    This program, ProAsm, is distributed as Shareware. It may be freely
redistributed, but no charges other than reasonable copying and handling
fees may be collected (not over US $5 per floppy disk, or more than US $50
per CD). The program may be distributed only as originally release, in the
complete archived form.

    Please be aware that the registered version of ProAsm and its utilities
will not be available from Aminet.


    The standard registration covers:
         -  The ProAsm assembler and associated utilities and numerous
            routine files.

            The distribution contains NO include files from Commodore/ESCOM,
            as I have no license to include them.

         -  Free minor updates (probably via E-Mail or a mailing of
            one disk), and one free major update (complete package).
            Later major update releases can be ordered for about 30% of
            the registration fee.

         -  Additional future registered updates on request will cost
            5 SFr./5 DM/5 $US.

         -  Possibility to get a full S.I.M. registration for a reduced
            fee (10 $US). S.I.M. is a lowlevel debugger and monitor and
            its unregistered version can be found on Aminet in the
            dev/debug directory as 'sim172.lha'.



    The registered version comes with additional features:
         -  Removed the code and data size limitation. The non-registered
            version is limited to 8 kbytes (8192 bytes) output code.

         -  Complete instruction set: MC68000-MC68060, MC68881/68882,
            and MC68851.

         -  All macro directives enabled.

         -  Multipass optimization enabled.

         -  All floating-point directives enabled.

         -  All optimizations enabled.

         -  Registration notice removed.



    To register send the registration fee in one of the following manners:
         -  Cash, preferred (in BILLS only). The easiest and for you the
            cheapest way is to send money in an envelope. But this is not
            the best thing to send through mail.

         -  A check drawn on a SWISS BANK in Swiss Francs (SFr).

         -  POSTAL MONEY ORDER, drawn in SFr.

         -  EuroChecks are also accepted, but they must be in Swiss Francs
            and the benificary should be 'Daniel Weber'.

         -  An INTERNATIONAL MONEY ORDER, drawn in SFr with the address
            of a SWISS BANK on the front.

         -  Private cheques are accepted, but cashing them is very expensive.
            So make sure to additionally submit the extra charge when sending
            a private cheque: US$ 10.-, £ 6.-, DM 10.-,...

         -  Swiss residents can use my PostCheck account 80-219240-0.


    Any currencies are accepted, please use the US Dollar prices as reference.

    You do not need to send any extra money for return postage, that is
    part of the registration fee, except otherwise noted.

    If you send the registration form via email, and want to know if I have
    received your money, send another email about two weeks after the
    registration.
