                                   Note
                                   ----

All of these source codes cann be assembled using the evaluation version
of the ProAsm assembler. The only exception is 'gtfdemo', that needs
the full macro capability of ProAsm, but an already assembled version
is included.

While assembling the other source codes you may encounter the following
error message:

          REGISTERED VERSION ONLY: if you like ProAsm...

In the most cases this error message is issued when the attempt was made
to enable optimization. You can stop this messages by commenting the
concerned line by inserting a semicolon (";") at the beginning of the line.

Refer also to the 'routines_lib.guide' and the 'registration.doc' for
further details.



Some of the source codes may complain about missing include files.
Sorry for that, but the distribution contains NO include files from
Commodore/ESCOM, as I have no license to include them.
