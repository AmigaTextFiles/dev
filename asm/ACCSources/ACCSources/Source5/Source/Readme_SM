  Hi Mark just sending you this little program in reply to your query
about using two viewports on the same display using graphics lib routines.
This rather crappy demo uses three viewports.One at the top,one in the middle
 (with a rastport attached) and one at the bottom.The top and bottom viewports
both use the same bitmap structure but have seperate rasinfo structures.The
rasinfo ri_RyOffset variables are set up so that the top and bottom viewports
look like they are one single viewport.These are then scrolled together while
the middle viewport remains stationary scrolling this message using the graphics
 lib ScrollRaster call.The complete commented source is included on this disk
so that you can see how it was done.There is also a seperate Readme file on this disk
 that gives an explanation of setting up multiple viewports.The music is the theme
from 'The Neverending Story' and was created by Alastair Brimble using Brian Postma's
SoundMonitor. --- This message will now restart ---
