Function
========

 PPMuchMore is a text file viewer that allows the user to open multiple
windows and view a unique file in each. To add to the programs flexability
it can also decrunch files packed by PowerPacker ( written by Nico Francois
) and has the option to save the decrunched text to disc.

 When more than one window is open, click in the one you wish to browse.
The windows may be closed in any order.

*****************************************************************************

			 WARNING


 Closing multiple windows in quick succession may lead to a Guru
Meditation. I am not sure why this is, but I have experienced the same
result from other programs ( namely Argasm assembler ). If you can suggest
a solution to this problem please write to me at the above address

Usage
=====

 The program can be started from the WorkBench by 'Double-Clicking' on it's
icon. The program may also be launched from the CLI by typing:

	ppmuchmore
or	ppmuchmore <filename>

 If the second CLI option is used, the program attempts to load and display
the text file specified.

 The program starts by opening a blank window, you access the available
commands by pressing keys on the keyboard. Below is a description of all
implemented commands and the keys to press to invoke them.

 KEY			COMMAND SUMMARY
 ---			---------------
  L			Load a text file. This option uses the ARP 
			filerequester to obtain the name of the file to
			load. NOTE that while the requester is being 
			displayed, all PPMuchMore windows are disabled. If
			you select a crunched file it will automatically be
			decrunched.

  S			This option saves the text file visible in the
			currently active window. The file is always saved
			as a standard ASCII file. Again the ARP
			filerequester is used to obtain the name to save
			the file as and all PPMuchMore windows are disabled
			while this is displayed.

  M			More. This option opens another window. You can
			then load another file into this window. All
			commands are available from the new window.

  Q			Quit. Kills the currently active window. If this is
			the only PPMuchMore window open the program ends.

  T			Top. Displays the top page of the text file.

  B			Bottom. Displays the last page of the text file.

  F			Find. A window will open into which you must enter
			a string to search the file for. While this window
			is open all PPMuchMore windows are disabled.
			 If the string is found, the line containing it is
			displayed at the top of the PPMuchMore window.

  N			Next. Finds the next occurence of a string in the 
			text file and displays the line containing it at
			the top of the PPMuchMore window.

  P			Previous. Finds the previous occurence of a string
			in the text file and displays the line containing 
			it at the top of the PPMuchMore window.

  G			Goto. This opens a window into which you enter a 
			line number. While this window is open all
			PPMuchMore windows are disabled.
			 Providing a valid line number is given the line
			specified will be displayed at the top of the
			PPMuchMore window.

  D			Dump File. Prints the contents of the file on the
			printer using the PRT: device.

 SHIFT PLUS D		Dump Page. Prints the contents of the PPMuchMore
			window to the printer using the PRT: device.
			{{{ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED }}}


 CURSOR UP/DOWN		Scrolls the display through the text file one line
			at a time in the required direction.

   SHIFT PLUS		Moves the display through the text file one page at
 CURSOR UP/DOWN		a time in the required direction.

  HELP			Displays a window that details each available 
			command. Note that all PPMuchMore windows remain
			enabled with this window open, so you can view the
			instructions while browsing a file. PPMuchMore will
			not free itself if this window is left open. To
			close this window click where it says 'CLICK HERE'.

 This utility requires the arp.library and powerpacker.library. They should
be in the libs directory of any bootable disc that you are going to use it
from.
