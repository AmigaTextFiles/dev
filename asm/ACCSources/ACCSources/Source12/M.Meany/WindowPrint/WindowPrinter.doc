 This program and it's source are Public Domain.

 I accept no responsability for damage caused through use of this program.

 This program was written to allow graphical printer dumps to be obtained
from programs that open windows, but have no print option. At present the
graphics are scaled to full printer page width, the printer device handaling
the vertical scaling.

 You must ensure that the printer preferences are set up to accomodate your
printer, failure to do so can lead to Meditations or random patterns being
printed.

 Usage
 -----

 The program can be launched from the WorkBench by double clicking on its
icon or from the CLI by entering its full path name. Once running a window
opens roughly in the middle of the screen. Clicking in any other visible
window will cause that window to be printed.

 Credits
 -------

 I would like to thank Dave Edwards for his exec_support.i assembly file and
Steve Marshall for getting me interested in devices in the first place.
