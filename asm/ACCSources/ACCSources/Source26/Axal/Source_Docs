Source Doc's

 Not much this month becoz of  exams  and  assignment  etc.  but I've sent the
following:

 MAPPINGEXAMPLE.S

    This is just the source to  blit  a  map  onto  the  screen  with the data
taken from a map and block file  made  with  my  mapper.  Hope to have a small
working version finished within a couple  of days and will send the source for
it soon.

 MULTISPRITEDEMO.S

    Best to see the description within the source file for this one. It allows
you to make a screen out of  sprites.  See  the  source and you'll know what I
mean.

 PT11BVOL-PLAY.S

    I was writing a demo in which  everything  fades  in (screen, logo, music,
scroller, music etc.) and at the end  of  it everything fades out.  The person
watching the demo can select when to exit  the demo so I needed a music player
which could fade the music out at  any  point  in  the music.  Thus, I came up
with this one!  It will fade Noise/Protracker music out at any speed.  All you
supply is the fade speed.  See example sources.

 MUSICFADETEST1.S

    The first music fade test.   This  is  used  for  a  straight forward demo
without the need for interrupts (I  think  using interrupts with the player is
easier, but not everyone can understand how they work at first. I didn't!).

 MUSICFADETEST2.S

    The second music fade test.  This one is done with interrupts (the easiest
way me thinks!).  Very simple to follow.

 AXL-AMIGATOVAX.S

    Don't know if this will be of use to  anyone  but  me.  It will convert an
Amiga  ASCII  text  file  to   an   ASCII   text  file  which  PC's  (and  VAX
mini-computers) will understand.  I done  this so I could take source code and
Dave Edward's docs disk to college on  a  PC formatted disk and port them onto
my VAX account.  I would then  print  them  on  the BIG and mega-FAST printers
thus saving me time (and money!).

 Have also sent a couple of nice pieces of music by Trooper!

                                       Axal.
