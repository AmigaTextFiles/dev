				Quick Tip
				~~~~~~~~~
 A quick tip for Devpac 3 users. If you have set the ' Auto Indent ' option
from the ' Settings - Set settings ' menu option, your code is probably
littered with what appear to be blank lines, but infact contain one or more
TAB characters. These TAB characters are unwanted and just waste memory, so
why not remove them?

 Removing unwanted TABs ( or any other character ) from the end of a line is
quite simple. First select the Search-And-Replace requester by selecting
' Find & Replace ' from the ' Search ' menu. In the ' Find ' string gadget
enter the sequence Left-Amiga-TAB then Left-Amiga-CTRL-J. On pressing Return, the
the ' Change To ' gadget activates. Press CTRL-X then Return to clear this
gadget. Finally press ' A ' to replace all occurrences of the search string.

 If Devpac reports that substitutions were made, move the cursor to the top
of the file and repeat the operation. Continue doing this until the ' Not
Found ' message appears. All unwanted TABs will have been removed!

 Another great tip by ' Shhh, you know who! ' ;-)
