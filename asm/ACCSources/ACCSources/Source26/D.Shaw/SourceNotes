 Have you ever seen a program and  thought  to  yourself, I wonder how that is
done. Well that is what this program is  all about, the program is not of much
use to anybody, but I thought I would write it anyway.
 
 The program attempts to simulate the system command info, attempts being  the
operative word, well it works to a  point.  As  this was only an experiment to
test out the Dos Library function Info there are a few bugs in it.

 Okay to try it out, assemble it disk  as  RAM:TEST,  then click on the window
depth gadget if the cli is behind genam and type, 

 RAM:TEST 0              ; Checks df0:
 RAM:TEST 1              ; "    " df1:
 RAM:TEST 2              ; "    " df2:
 RAM:TEST 3              ; "    " df3:

 please note this program will  not  check  hard  disks,  also if no number is
specified then it will default to checking df0:, use and abuse at will.
