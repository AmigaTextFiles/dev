 Assembling The Game
 ===================

 John sent this game to me on a disc set up to assemble from a hard disc.
Not being the lucky owner of such a device, I converted the files to
assemble straight from disc. However, John has sent the screen data and
some samples all in one object file which means you will have to dig out a
copy of Blink ( Devpac disc 2 in the C directory ). Follow the following
steps:

	1/ Decrunch the source to disc ( Squable decrunches onto a disc
	   of it's own for simplicity ).

	2/ Assemble main.s to the source disc as a LINKABLE file, give it
	   a name such as game.o

	3/ Run blink with the following command line:

		blink from df1:game.o df1:squable/chipdata.o to df1:game

 The executable file, game, will be produced on disc 1. I know this is a
long drawn out method of assembling, but for large programs it can be the
only way as defining all the data as incbins in the source gobbles up heaps
of memory.

 Last minute addittion: There seems to be a raw data file missing from the
disc, sorry about this. It is the one that contains the character set data.
This means the writing at the start of the game is all screwed up, but I'm
sure you can live with that ( or add your own data ).
