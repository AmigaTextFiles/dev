	All source supplied by me on this ACC disk is full Public
	Domain.  This means you can use it as you please with no
	conditions whatsoever.  If you do actually use something of mine
	in a demo/production - please let me see it!  I would very
	much like to see my source being put to use.  The source
	included this month includes :-
	
	Sprites - two starfields and a 16 colour animation routine.
	Read sprite tutorial for a full explanation of using sprites.
	
	Coppers - Cycling (again!) and drawing copper bars with the
	blitter.   The blitter copper bars where my preliminary
	attempts at a plasma routine.  The plasma has progressed since
	these early efforts and I hope to include it on ACC soon.
	
	Timer - A simple stop watch type routine.
	
	
	All of my routines use a macro include file titled 'MyMacros.i'
	(how original)  This file should be included with these sources
	and should be copied into your include/misc/ directory.  
	Remember - Only copy the file onto a back-up of your DevPac II
	disk - Never the original.  I used to use another perosnal
	include file called 'hardware/bplconbits.i'  If ever you come
	accross code which asks for this file - delete it from the
	include list - I don't use it anymore.
	
	Warning ->  When opening libraries I usually specify Version 34
	(V1.3 Amiga)  If you only have a version 1.2 Amiga you will need
	to alter this number to either 33 (V1.2) or zero (any version)
	
	If you notice any comments in my source which don't seem to apply
	to anything relevant - Ignore them - they are probably there
	by mistake!
