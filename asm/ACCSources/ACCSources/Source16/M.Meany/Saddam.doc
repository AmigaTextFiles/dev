 What Is StopSaddam
 ------------------

 StopSaddam is a small program written to detect the presense of one of the
latest, realy nasty, file viri.

 DrawBacks
 ---------

 Yes! There are a few. These, as far as I am aware, are:

	1/ The system looses about 1k ( Oh no! ) of memory.
	2/ The Intuition library is left open ( Oh no again! only 99.7 of
	  the programs I use need this library ).
	3/ The virus is detected and stopped from loading, but it is not
	  removed ... you can't have everythinhg! I am working on removal,
	  but it may be beyond me.
	4/ Though the virus does not make it into memory, the disc icon
	  does not vanish when the disc is removed. I'm not sure this is
	  a bad thing as it reminds you the disc is infected!
	5/ I'm not sure how an infected disc will behave once SADDAM has
	  been identified!
	6/ If the virus is on the boot disc it will not be detected. I'm
	  ready to adapt the code into a boot block and this restriction
	  should then be removed!

 Advantages
 ----------

 The Saddam file virus ( disk-validator ) will not run rampage through your
discs!

 Usage
 -----

 Run from the CLI with no parameters. This works best if done as one of the
first commands of the discs startup-sequence.

 Why?
 ----

 Because I discovered what it's like to loose discs because of this virus!
