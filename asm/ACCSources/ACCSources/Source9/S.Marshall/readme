 
 Lets Fix Someones Code
 ----------------------
 
 This section was dreamed up by Mike Cross. If you are having problems with
a program and are really stuck, then send the code to either Mike, Steve or
myself. Hardware problems should be sent to Mike, systems problems should
go to Steve. I will take either and what I cannot sort out I will pass on 
to Mike or Steve. Here are our addresses :
