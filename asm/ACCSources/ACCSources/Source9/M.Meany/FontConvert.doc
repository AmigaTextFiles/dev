 FontConvert
 ===========

 This program converts source generated by FontMaster into Devpac format.

 Here is an explanation of the problem. FontMaster generates Seka source
files and there are some incompatabilities with Devpac. These are:

 1/ End of lines are marked by a 0 byte, Devpac requires $0a (line feed ).

 2/ dc.b statements are placed in coloum 0, Devpac uses coloum 0 for labels
    only.

 Here is the way I got around this.

 Read all characters from Seka source file to a buffer. Starting at the
beginning of the buffer, copy each char until a 0 byte is encountered.
When a 0 byte is encountered, write a $0a byte, followed by a $09 byte to
the copy, ignoring the 0 byte. This eliminates both incompatabilities.

 To pad the program out and make it more user friendly, I added a couple of
error message routines, usage text and a CLI message displayed when the
program is started.

 Outline of Program
 ------------------

	1/ Open ARP library
	2/ Save pointer to and length of CLI parameters
	3/ Zero terminate CLI parameters
	4/ Get CLI output handle
	5/ Display opening message
	6/ If user has asked for instructions or omitted a filename
	   then display usage instructions and quit.
	7/ Reserve memory for new filename and construct this from the 
	   supplied filename adding _DEV to the end.
	8/ Reserve memory for Seka buffer
	9/ Reserve memory to construct Devpac source in
	10/ Open Seka source file, read in all text and close the file.
	11/ Open the Devpac source file
	12/ Write a short message to this file
	13/ Initialise some loop variables
	14/ Test next byte from seka buffer
	15/ If it is not a 0 then copy it to the Devpac buffer
	16/ If it is a 0 then write a $0a and $09 byte to the Devpac buffer
	17/ If not yet at end of Seka buffer, go back to step 14
	18/ Copy Devpac buffer to Devpac file, then close the file
	19/ Close ARP library and finish

 Note that the program makes extensive use of ArpAllocMem. The reason for
this is that ARP releases this memory when we close the ARP library, saving
us from having to keep track of it ( similar to Intuitions Rememberkey, but
no need to remember the key ).

 At the end of the program I have tagged on a couple of routines that
display usage instructions as well as error messages.
