 Blaine has supplied three sprite sources this month, along with the source
for his game. The game source will appear next time round. The sprite
examples have been well commented and demonstrate smooth sprite movement.

 There may be a problem with one or more routine not freeing up memory
correctly. This may cause problems when trying to asemble code after
running one of these examples and you will have to reset the computer.
