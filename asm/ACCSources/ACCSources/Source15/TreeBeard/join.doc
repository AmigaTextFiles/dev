JOIN Replacement Doc    by TreeBeard '91
====================

I wrote this after spending about quarter of an hour just joining a few files
together into one big one, and deleting the originals using the Join and
delete commands.  I thought it would be a good idea to replace the Join
command with one which enabled the user to join them and delete them in one
go.

The syntax is:

Join <input files> to <output file> [del] [addlet <start><finish>]

There must be a space between the TO and the output files
All files are seperate by spaces
Character case does not matter except in addlet

Join ?
will print the syntax

DEL deletes all input files after joining them
ADDLET uses the first input file and adds letters to it,
       eg. ADDLET AD will add an A, then a B, then a C, then D.
       The two letters MUST be in the same case as each other (though
       they don't need to be in the same case as the actual files are)

If DEL is selected and an error occurs on, say, the third file, the
second and first will have been deleted and joined into the master
file, so you should keep the master file, sort out the error, and
then use continue the join by using the master file instead of using
the first two (deleted) files.

If an error occurs during joining, you will be given the option of
deleting the output file or keeping it.  

- It can be used just like the original Join command is
   eg. to join Circle, Square and Triangle into Shapes, keeping the
       originals, it would be

	join circle square triangle to Shapes

- It can do the above and delete the circle square and triangle files
  after it has joined them by adding DEL to the end

- If you save some files by lettering them, eg. blocka, blockb, blockc
  blockd, etc. you can join them by using ADDLET
   eg. to join Castlea, Castleb, Castlec, etc... up to Castlej into
       CastleBlocks

	join castle to CastleBlocks addlet aj

   Do not use addlet Aj, or an error will occur, but if it was CastleA
   CastleB, etc. the example would still work.

   DEL and ADDLET can be used together
