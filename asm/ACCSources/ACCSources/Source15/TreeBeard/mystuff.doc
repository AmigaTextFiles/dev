VERTICAL SCROLLER
=================

Just scrolls & loops a screen vertically.

REFLECTIONS
===========

Puts a bob on the screen, and after LMB is pressed reflects it vertically.
Press RMB after this to quit.

MOVEBOB
=======

Moves a bob left and right across the top of the screen.

ROTBALLS (1 & 2)
================

First, when the program uses angles, there was no need for the accuracy
of 360 different angles, and so it uses 72 (360/5) angles, so divide all 
angles in degrees by 5.

The programs put an structure of balls on the screen and rotate it.  There
are two ways of rotating it uses: turning round the centre point (ie. left
and right) and round an imaginary horizontal line through the middle of the
screen (ie. up and down).

The first type of rotation is similar to the way you draw circles on an 
ancient Basic with no circle command.  The ball positions are defined by 
their distance from the centre (d) and the angle they are at (a) (eg. 40 
units away from the centre at 30°:

     Ball
|    /
|30°/
|__/-40 units
| /
|/
Centre

) So the x position of the ball relative to the centre would normally
be SIN (a) * d and the y position COS (a) * d, but if the angle of l/r
rotation is B they are SIN (a+B) * d and COS (a+B) * d.  Then the
second type of rotation (u/d) is used.  If the angle of rotation is C, 
all it does is multiply the y position by the SIN C, so at 0° it is
always 0 (SIN 0 = 0) and at 90° they are unaffected (SIN 90 = 1).

The sine numbers are generated by multipling the distance by one number
and dividing by another.  Eg. Sin 30 (.5) the distance is * 1 / 2.

The only remaining problem after that in which order the balls are put
on the screen.  For half of the u/d angles one ball could be infront
and the for the other half the same one would be at the back, so to
the balls are all defined in order with the frontmost one first and
backmost one last, and for 270° to 90°, the last balls in the structure
are put on first, so they will appear at the back, and for the other
angles they are put on in the right order so the first ones appear
at the back.

The program would flicker a lot if the balls were put directly onto the
screen, so a worskspace a quarter of the screen in size is used to put
the balls on and then is copied to the centre of the screen.

The ball structure starts with the number of balls in structure-1 
(long word) and then each ball is defined by (all in bytes):

- distance from circle. The maximum is 64-the size of the object you
  are using (for the balls this is 51)
- angle ball is at.  Remember this is in °/5
- object number.  At the moment this is 0 for yellow ball or 1 for
  a red one

The difference between the 2 programs is the first rotates on its own
and the second is controlled by the arrow keys.
