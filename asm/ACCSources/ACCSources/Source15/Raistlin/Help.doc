		     ---------------

their is alot of potential in being able to move bobs across a background.
However if you wanted to move loads of different bobs (anims, etc) across
a background you would need loads of different masks.  This would be tedious
to do & would consume loads of memory.  With this routine you simply reserve
a block of memory that will fit your largest bobs mask & then build every
bobs mask into this memory area with the routine.  The memory area will need
to be wiped after the mask has been used ready for the next mask to be built
into it.  This should be done with a simple D blit with no miniterms set.
The only problem with using this routine is that it takes time.  You should
optimize the routine where necessary for speed.  I did it this way for 
simplicity & because this routine fits all masks (I think).


See the actual routine to see which reigsters need to be loaded with which
values.
