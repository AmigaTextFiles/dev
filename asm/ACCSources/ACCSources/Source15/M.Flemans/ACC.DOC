 Yo there hords of fans,
                         after a totally awsome delay of a few months
 I am back spewing out more source from Devpac for you to curse and 
 swear at. I bet you havn't been wondering where I've been well I got
 a job ( of course !! ). Yup I'm now a professional programmer. ( Cor
 look at all this structured source !!! ).

 Any how, what you should find on this disk is the following bits  ...
 
 
 DUAL-TEXT EXAMPLE
 -----------------

 A very small intro that I wrote to make a nice and fancy text display
 It uses one plane of text but the second plane has a difference of a
 few bytes ( the screen width ) and is offset by the scroll register.
 The idea came off an LSD intro ( Thanxs Guyz ).
  
 MOUSE-MENU EXAMPLE
 ------------------

 Fed up of all those demo compacts with the boring press F1 - F10 well
 this could be the answer. I wrote this because my Amiga keyboard is
 playing up and not allowing me to type anything. Its sooooooo easy to
 use but the speed of the bar moves a bit to fast ( only a bit !!!).
 
 F-KEY MENU V2 EXAMPLE
 ---------------------

 Fed up of using my mouse menu already, ok this is a mixture of the 
 Dual-text Intro and my F-key menu which appeared on Issue 6 ( I think
 a long time ago !! ). Its small and compact and powerpacker will
 crucnch it to about Ohhh, 2k !. So its brilliant to use.


 Well thats it so now, so long and happy assembling 
                                     ( GURUing Ha,ha!!)
                                                         Mark
