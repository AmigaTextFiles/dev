				Source Notes
				~~~~~~~~~~~~

 I'm afraid I don't have much to offer this month, mainly due to what's
been going on around me. Still here is a run down of what I've included:

 virus.s
 ~~~~~~~
 As promised this is the amalgimation of my StopSaddam code and Mike
Cross's virus killer source. Basically, a patch is added to the AllocAbs()
exec library function to detect for the Saddam file virus and also exec
vectors are checked to ensure no reset proof nasties are lurking in memory.

 vilbm.s
 ~~~~~~~
 Cheating really! This is an adaption of Steve Marshalls ILBM.s source to
act as a CLI based IFF viewer. You will have to refer to Steves docs on an
earlier disc to understand this one.

 Scribe.s
 ~~~~~~~~
 An example application of using DOS_Start.s. I wanted a quick way of
removing the $0d bytes left by Scribble! when printing a document to disc.
This was the result.

 Clock.s
 ~~~~~~~
 Something I have wanted to do for ages, set up a title bar clock. This
code uses the DOS library to read the date stamp, converts this to real
time and then displays the result in the window title bar. The program
relies on INTUITICKS messages from Intuition, so deactivating the window
will disable clock updates. Upon reactivation, the correct time is again
displayed.

 Anyone fancy ading an alarm feature????

 Boxes.s
 ~~~~~~~
 There I sat, browsing my early disc collection, and what do I find? An
Amiga Basic disc. After digging the Extras disc out, I find a really crap
routine called Boxes. ' Surely the Amiga can go faster than that! ' I says
to myself.......

 BuildDcb.s
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 This ones a subroutine. Use this to convert blocks of memory into dc.w
statements in an open disc file. This code was written for inclusion in
ImageMaker.

 ImageMaker.s
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 A zombie! This util died a death ages ago when I lost interest in it. I
have since resurected it and exterminated ( I hope ) the serious bugs in
the image creation source.

 The idea is, load an IFF brush, save the source for an image to display
the brush. It works ..... see seperate tutorial for more instructions.

 Follow2.s
 ~~~~~~~~~
 More bobs! This routine uses a dual playfield display, double buffered,
and displays 80 animated bobs ( though they're really boring ). The idea
was to create another linked bob list, it  works, but only just!
