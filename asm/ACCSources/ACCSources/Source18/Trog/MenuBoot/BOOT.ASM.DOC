             		ASSEMBLING DOCS FOR V1.0
		      ****************************

ALL CODE IN THIS DIRECTORY WAS CODED BY THE TROG OF PIROSOFT IN JULY 1991
ALL CODE IS MODUAL BASED AND SHOULD BE COMPLETLY REUSABLE WITH LITTLE EFFORT
THERE IS ONLY 1 INCLUDE FILE AND THAT IS CALLED LIbOFFSETS.I AND SHOULD BE
IN THE MISC INCLUDE DRAW OF YOUR BOOTDISK (SYS DISK)

ALL FILES NEEDED FOR MENU BOOT V1.0 ARE IN THIS DIRECTORY AND IN ORDER FOR
FOR ALL THE FILES TO BE JOINED YOU SHOULD DO THE FOLLOWING

HAVE A DISK WITH GENAM2 ON IT IN DISK DF0:
THIS DISK IN DF1:
TYPE EXECUTE BOOTMENU/MAKEPRG.EXE
THEN A FILE WILL BE CREATED AND GENAM2 WILL BE LOADED WITH A FILE ON DF0:PRG
NOW AFTER ALL THIS HAS TAKEN PLACE YOU WILL HAVE THE FULL FILE IN DF0: CALLED
PRG

 Yo, It's me! The guy who knows how to turn CAPS off. Sorry, only joking
Trog. Just a brief note to say I have added a list of includes to the end
of the main source routine, 'prg.s', that causes all other files to be
automatically loaded in. No need to execute script files and deprotect your
beloved Devpac disc!!!
