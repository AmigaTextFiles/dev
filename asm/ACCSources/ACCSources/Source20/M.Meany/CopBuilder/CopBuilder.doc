 Believe it or not, this was not intended to be a utility. I was thinking
about Axals request for a map builder and how such a program would start
life.

 I decided to write a startup module for such a program that would allow the
user to specify the width, height, depth and resolution of the map about to
be edited.

 If maps were going to be designed out of 16x16 pixel blocks then further
restrictions would have to be placed on the allowable width and height of
a map. This would be easy to add at some later date.

 Anyway, I got this program together without the save option and decided I
needed some method of checking the Copper lists it was generating. I added
code to convert the Copper list into a source file.

 This was ok, but each source file had to be edited so that my old PutPlane
subroutine would work with it. I decided to add a subroutine to the output
that would fill in the bitplane pointers and colour values for the Copper
list saved with it.

 The end result works quite well. I know it only deals with a couple of the
many display modes available, but is none the less useful for getting a
quick Copper list to display that odd sized picture that`s hanging around.

 The code calculates bitplane modulos, so if you specify a playfield of say
640x500x3 to be displayed on a LoRes PAL display, no modifications are needed
to the list generated.

 Just to prove this point, I have included two examples that test the source
generated by the program. 

 Is there a future for a utility of this form? For instance, an ILBM reader
could be added to the program. This would allow a Copper list to be generated
for any IFF picture loaded and also the raw data could be saved out by the
program as well. This would result in an IFF converter/ Copper list builder.

 Well if you would have a use for such a program, write and tell me. Or if
you can follow my code, improve the program and send me the finished version.

 Looking at the code, you will see that this is a very simple piece of code.
The hardest task to achieve is transforming the numeric data available into
ASCII form for saving. For this I have used RawDoFmt(), my old friend from
the Exec library.

 Yet again the program is built up from my standard Int_Start.s code, with
just a few modifications.
