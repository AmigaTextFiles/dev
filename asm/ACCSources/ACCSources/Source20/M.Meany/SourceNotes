	Source Notes
	~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Most of my code has an accompanying doc file this month, but for those files
that don't here is a brief run through of what I have included:

AlarmClock 
~~~~~~~~~~
 Last month I presented a useless clock program that was powered by
INTUITICKS. Well this version is just as useless!

 The clock now used the DOS library function, Delay(), to do it`s timing.
To add to it`s appeal, there is even an alarm feature ( silent at present ).
The idea here was to help me keep track of time spent on the computer, the
clock supplied with my Amy will only sound the alarm if it is the active
window, I expect it is INTUITICKS powered. This version will alarm even if
it`s window is not active.

VectorCheck
~~~~~~~~~~~
 This program waits for a disc to be inserted and then checks certain
system vectors. I wrote this as a quick demonstration for Dave Shaw, see
elsewhere on this disc.

CopBuilder
~~~~~~~~~~
 Strange utility this. I never intended it to end up as it has!
 
 The program will allow you to specify screen resolution, to a degree, and
also what size playfield you intend to display on the screen. For example
you could specify a LORES, NTSC screen displaying a 800x600x4 playfield.

 What the program does is write a Copper list for you that will set up just
such a display. It even writes out a subroutine that will copy the bitplane
address pointers for your raw data into the list and also set up all the
required colour registers. All you supply is the raw data, save CMAP behind.

 I have written two examples that implement Copper lists generated by this
utility.

Super
~~~~~
 This project opens a SuperBitMap window with proportional gadgets in its
borders. The playfield is larger than the WorkBench screen, so you have to
use these scroll gadgets to see everything!

 The idea here was to develop a window that could be used in a map designer.
I hope to have progressed this somewhat by next month.

Numbers
~~~~~~~
 This is really a subroutine. It will read an ASCII string and turn this into
a long word value. To expand on that a little, it will read an ASCII number
in either hex, decimal, octal or binary and produce a long word value.

 I hope to be using this along with Dave Edwards expression evaluator fairly
soon.

MED Replayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 I searched the disk for easyplayer.a, honest!
 
 I wanted a MED replayer and could not find one, so I built one from all the
source modules supplied on the OctaMed disc. This version plays a module
incbin`d with it, but I have put code in their to load and play modules.

LibHelp
~~~~~~~
 A useful utility at last, at least I think so!
 
 Type in the name of a library function and you will be presented with all
the calling parameters for it, what registers they should be in and what
library the function is in.

 WorkBench 2 libraries are supported!


 Well that rounds up my offerings, except for a couple of subroutines....
