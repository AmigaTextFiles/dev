 The windows used by this program were designed using PowerSource v3.0, a
utility available on Fred Fish #547 written by Jan van den Baard.

 Disclaimer
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 Every effort has been made to ensure the correct function of this program
on a version 2.0 Amiga and the data it presents is extracted from the
version 2 .fd files. I must point out that I cannot gaurantee the accuracy
of this information and will not be responsible for mistakes or the
consequences of any mistakes.

 Program Function
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The program has been designed to give quick access to the calling
parameters for system library functions. The parameters are displayed in
the order of decleration for the convenience of C programmers. To assist
assembly language programmers, the registers in which the parameters should
be located are also displayed.

 I wrote this utility because I have a terrible memory. I use the libraries
all the time and this means constantly refering to books to discover what
to put into which register. Those days are now gone.

 Use
 ~~~
 If your programming the Amiga then figuring out how to use this utility
should take you about five seconds. There is a string entry gadget where
the name of the function you require info on should be entered. The search
mode in not case sensitive, so openlibrary is as good as OpenLibrary.

 The program will respond to an input by either displaying information on
the function or giving a message saying no information was available.

 There is a sleep gadget which can be used to shrink the main window to
minimum size and send it to sleep. To wake the program up again first
activate the small window, then press the mouse menu ( right ) button.

 The About gadget is just a freeware notice.
