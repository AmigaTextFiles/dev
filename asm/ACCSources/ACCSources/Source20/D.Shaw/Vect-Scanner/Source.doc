	Hi Acc readers,
		This is a small program to hopfully help the untechnically
minded amiga user the idea is this program can sit in the background and
multi-task,the reason for writing this was a few months ago at the ACC party
at Blaine's,Hi Blaine we all caught a nasty ! Virus ! (Had me in bed for 
weeks) ok bad joke,anyway it was the saddam virus,nasty little F@#!$&
and before i knew what had happened 100 disk's infected,so to stop this
ever happening again i wrote this program which still need more added to it
to be effective enough,but it just shows what you can learn from ACC i had
never coded until i started getting ACC,(thank's for all the help Mark)
and now i am flying along at a great rate,enough waffle.
	If anyone has any idea's on how to make the next version any better
then please let me know and i will try to implement them,my next program
is hopefully going to be a bootblock database to save game disk bootblocks
this is just another part of the learning process,ok time to go now,but
practice makes (nearly perfect) HA!HA.

 ***** See my version for scanning vectors when a disk is inserted. Also look
 at mine and Mikes earlier virus checker for more goodies,
