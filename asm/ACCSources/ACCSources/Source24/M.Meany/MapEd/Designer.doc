 What is it?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 This utility is intended for programmers designing games/demos that use a
map to build screens up from a predefined set of block graphics. Consider
the following map:

	00,05,07

 This would be interpreted as 'Block 0', 'Block 5', 'Block 7'.

 The reason for using such a technique is that using 16x16 pixel blocks, or
tiles as they are often refered to as, a 320x256 screen can be represented
by just 20x16 bytes. The memory savings are tremendous.

 The problems arise when putting a map together. A program such as Deluxe
Paint can be used to design the tiles, but what about the map? Enter this
utility.....

 This utility allows you to design maps and save them to disk, but thats
not all there is to it! There are facilities for grabbing the tiles from an
IFF ILBM file created with a paint package, designing collision masks and
saving the tiles out in a variety of formats.

 The designer is not limited to only 320x256 screens. When first run, you
specify the dimensions of the screen you wish to work on. This means
entering the Width ( in tiles ), the Height ( in tiles ) and the Depth. The
program will adjust itself accordingly. From then on you can move around
the map plonking tiles down wherever you so please.

 Once a map has been designed, you can save it. The program can load back
maps created previously to allow further editing.

 The Designer Screen
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Once the dimensions of the screen you wish to work on have been entered,
the main editing screen opens. This screen is split vertically into two
sections. the top section is where you place tiles and so build the map.
The bottom section allows access to all the programs facilities. As this is
only a beta version of the program, not all facilities are yet implemented
as will be explained shortly.

 Use the mouse to select the section of the screen you wish to work in.

 Gadgets In The Bottom Section
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 All facilities are accessed by clicking on the appropriate gadget in the
bottom section of the screen. Here is an outline of what is available:

 File -	Opens a window that allows you to access all load/save options
	available. Those currently implemented are:

	- Blocks: Retrievable Load & Save
	- Blocks: Raw Save in any of the following formats:
			Consecutive Bitplanes, no Mask bitplane
			Consecutive Bitplanes, with Mask bitplane
			Interleaved Bitplanes, no Mask bitplane
			Interleaved Bitplanes, with Mask bitplane    
	- Blocks: Grab from IFF. This will take an IFF ILBM file of the same
		  depth as the screen you are working with and cut it up
		  into tiles, working left->right then top->bottom. The
		  colour palette is also loaded and used.

	- Screen: Load & Save. Saves each block number as 1 byte of data.
		  Map is saved working left->right then top->bottom.

 Block - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Will be a tile editor soon!

 Mask - Fully functional mask editor. The current tile is displayed along
	with its mask. You can edit this mask and see the difference. There
	is also a store where one mask can be saved if you need the same mask
	over and over! There is also a quick fill and clear option.
	The mask you create will only be assigned to the block if you exit
	by selecting the 'Use' gadget.

 CMAP -	NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Will soon be a palette editor.

 About- NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Obvious what this will be..

 CLR  - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Will allow the map to be cleared, each cell
	will be assigned the currently active tile.

 Quit - Obvious!

 Selecting A Tile
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The designer can cope with 250 tiles. At any one time 30 of these are
visible in the bottom left corner of the display. To the right of the tiles
are two scroll gadgets to scroll the tile display up and down so that you
can access the other tiles.

 Clicking on a tile will select it. The currently selected tile is displayed
between the up and down scroll gadgets so you can see at a glance which one
you are using.

 Putting A Tile Into The Map
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Once a tile has been selected, you can start plonking it into the map.
This is done by first selecting the top section where a large white cursor
awaits. To move the cursor around the map, move the mouse pointer to a the
desired position and click the left mouse button. Holding this button down
and moving the mouse will cause the cursor to follow the mouse pointer.

 Pressing the right mouse button will plonk the tile into the map. Holding
this button down and moving the mouse will cause the tile to be drawn into
all cells entered.

 If your map is larger than the display area can accomodate, there are four
scroll gadgets to the right of the tile up/down gadgets. Clicking on one of
these will scroll the display allowing you to access the whole map.

 The Raw File Formats
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Screen Map File
---------------
 When you save a screen, one byte is saved for each tile in the map. The 
tiles are saved from left to right, then from top to bottom. This is the
only format supported at this time.

Block File - Consecutive
------------------------
 In order to use a map, you need the tile data to rebuild the screen. This
option saves the tiles one after the other, ie 

 block1, block2, block3, ..... , block255

 The individual bitplanes of the tile are saved one after the other, hence
consecutive save. You may also wish to save the tiles collision mask data,
if so it will follow the tiles bitplanes.

 Eg. 1st 3 Tiles for a display of depth 2, no mask data:

	tile1 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3
	tile2 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3
	tile2 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3
	tile3 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3
	tile3 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3

 Eg. 1st 3 Tiles for a display of depth 2, with mask data included:

	tile1 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3, mask bitplane
	tile2 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3, mask bitplane
	tile2 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3, mask bitplane
	tile3 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3, mask bitplane
	tile3 bitplane1, bitplane2, bitplane3, mask bitplane

Block File - Interleaved
------------------------
 Choosing interleaved format will cause the tiles bitplane data to be saved
in a similar format to that used for sprite bitplanes:

	line 1 plane 1
	line 1 plane 2
	line 1 plane 3
	  "      "
	line 2 plane 1
	line 2 plane 2
	line 2 plane 3
	  "      "
	line 3 plane 1
	line 3 plane 2
	line 3 plane 3
	  "      "
	  "      "
	  "      "
	line 16 plane 1		<< all tiles are 16 lines high >> 
	line 16 plane 2
	line 16 plane 3
	  "      "

 If you do not opt for mask data to be save with a tile, you will get a file
with the following format:

	interleaved tile 1
	interleaved tile 2
	interleaved tile 3
	   "	     "
	   "         "
	interleaved tile 256

 If you do opt for mask data to be saved with a tile, the following format
is used:

	interleaved tile 1
	mask bitplane for tile 1
	interleaved tile 2
	mask bitplane for tile 2
	interleaved tile 3
	mask bitplane for tile 3

	   "	     "
	   "         "
	interleaved tile 256
	mask bitplane for tile 256

 Comments
 ~~~~~~~~
 I have used this editor to design screens, terrible they may be, for my
own game development source and also Paul Kents 'Tanx' game previewed on
last months disk ( I admit that Pauls code took some persuading to accept
a map in byte format instead of words, but there you go ... ).

 Is there a format I've completely overlooked in my ignorance? If so please
tell me.

 What other features could be added? For example, the option to append a
custom file header to a screen map file. This could be entered as hex or
loaded from a file --- just an idea, but may be worth it!

 I will be changing all event loops that use INTUITICKS to monitor drawing
routines to run off MOUSEMOVES instead, this should speed things up a bit.
I wrote this code in two days, my main objective was that it worked!

 I will add a sleeping pointer ( yes, the same one I always use! ) that
will be displayed while the program is preforming prolonged operations,
such as loading/saving files and building the screen.

 I will also try to address the filerequester so that it 'remembers' the
last directory visited and also looks a little tidyer.

 Was it worth the effort?

			 Mark.

..... Anyone interested in writing a proper doc file for it?
