"earth.library" DEVELOPERS' MANUAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This manual can be read in any order,
but it makes more sense if you order it like this:

    1)	README_FIRST		(this document)
    2)	Pure.doc		About PURE programming
    3)	Strings.doc		Assorted string routines
    4)	Lists.doc		A couple of list routines
    5)	Hooks.doc		About Hooks
    6)	Trees.doc		About binary trees
    7)	CLIUtils.doc		Assorted functions
    8)	autodocs/*		Individual function descriptions

================================================================================

How to print out the documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just CD into the docs directory and type at the command line:

	PRINT_DOCS

This will run the script file PRINT_DOCS which prints out all required
documentation in the right order. Make sure that your preferences
settings have the right page length (normally 60 for that tractor fed
stuff), as the program uses PPType, which makes use of that setting.
Also make sure that PPType is somewhere in your command search path,
or the script file won't work.

The documentation is extensive, so you'll need a lot of paper.

================================================================================

WHAT IS "earth.library"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "earth.library" is a shared runtime library (just like
"intuition.library") which may be used by an application make various
new functions available.

"earth.library" is written entirely in machine code. Its functions are
therefore extremely fast.

================================================================================

OPENING THE "earth.library".
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements:
	The file "earth.library" must be present in your system LIBS:
	directory (or otherwise available to the system).

	You require EITHER "arp.library" OR "utility.library" in your
	system LIBS: directory (or otherwise available to the system).
	This is not too serious a problem since "arp.library" is public
	domain and may be freely distributed with your application.
	It is included on this disc.

Once "earth.library" is known to the system, you can open it using the
Exec OpenLibrary() function.

The current version number of "earth.library" is defined by the
constant EARTHVERSION in the include files "earth/earthbase.i" and
"earth/earthbase.h".

===============================================================================
PUBLIC DOMAIN NOTICE
===============================================================================

"earth.library" is freeware, not shareware. There is no fee.

On the other hand, there are advantages to "registering". Just send a
blank disc and a stamped self-addressed envelope (enclose an
international reply coupon if writing from outside the UK) and we will
fill your disc full of goodies (ie latest releases of EarthSoft products)
and post it back to you. If you forget the stamped envelope (or
international reply coupon) then we shall keep your disc - you have been
warned.

"earth.library" was written by Arcane Jill.
Copyright 1992, EarthSoft.

This program is FREEWARE
It is NOT shareware.
