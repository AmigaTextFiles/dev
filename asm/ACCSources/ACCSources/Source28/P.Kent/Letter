Hi All!

OK straight down to business:

DelJam - A small util I have been experimenting with that stops any files
         from being deleted. It is not very satisfactory since files
         can be copied over.
         The code provides an example of how to setfunction the DOS
         library. Please note that this code requires reqtools.library
         and WB2.0 : the 1.3 dos library has a non-standard library jumptable
         so the code will not run on a 1.3 machine.

Scaler - Zooms a 320*200 4 plane picture in realtime onto the screen.
         Please note that I did not write the DoScale routine in this
         code! I have edited and commented it however.

Tank-Attack - :-)
         My 4 player classic action game. See 'Tank-Attack.Assembling' for
         information, and the doc file for play details.
         The executable file is called 'MAIN'.
         Please note that to avoid nerving the guys at AmigaComputing I
         have stripped the game down by only sent five levels in, but I
         have also included the files required for the LevelEditor -
         see the information files.
         
I am also working on another game - Links - that is virtually complete bar
all of the levels. I will send this when I can!

                                  Enjoy!

Ps Sorry no time for a longer letter!
