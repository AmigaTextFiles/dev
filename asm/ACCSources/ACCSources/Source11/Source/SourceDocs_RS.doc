  This month I've sent 8 pieces of code. Only 3 of which are mine. Here is
the run down on what each one does.

 DEMO
------
At last I've done my first demo. It may not appear to be that stunning, but
it does utilise alot of techniques (all the different kind of sprite teqniques
I think!). The demo will only assemble on 1meg. Sorry!  However I did send 
Mark an assembled copy (which I doubt he'll use!!) so if any 512k owners want
to see it complain to Mark (it'll do you good tro have a laugh at my feeble 
attempt!)
   If you actualy view the demo you'll notice it lacks 2 major things. The 
first is double buffering (see below) and the second is to stop the mousy ptr
corrupting! How the hell do you stop the mouse ptr corrupting?  There seems to
be another problem. when the demo is run a few times it seems to slow the sys
down & weird things happen to the bobs!!  I know most of the routines are 
probably lame!!!

 DOUBLE BUFFERING
------------------
The demo I'm working on at the moment is huge!! Nots done some ace grafix!!
However this un will need DB so I had an attempt. This is what I came up 
with! As well as demonstrating to you a technique for double buffering, I
sent this so Mike Cross, Mark & all the other old timers could check it out
& tell me if it will be O.K. to use this to double buffer.
    For those interested all this does is to swap the screens ever 50th of
a second (during the vbl gap). screenc is a counter (1=screen 2 is being
displyed & 0 = screen 1 is being displayed) Screen is used to hold the
address of the actual screen to use. 
    If you don't know what double buffering is then listen close. When you
use BOBs (Blitter Objects) they tend to flicker (especially if there are lots
of BOBs near the top of the screen!). The reason for this is that the screen
is being drwan before the blitter has finished (& the blitter is supposed to
be fast!). to get round this problem you use 2 screens (& consequectly more
memory!). The one being shown is known as the physicall screen, while the
other is the logical screen. You do all your blits, etc on the logical screen
The 2 screens are swapped ever VBL & so you get smooth, flicker free 
movement. Its used in many games!!!  See Dave Edwards, ACC6 for more info.

 SPRITE & PLAYFIELD PRIORITY
-----------------------------
Having played Nitro for about 4 hours I decided to how i could make a car
go under a bridge. The only way I could think (apart from using the copper
to change sprite priority) is to use dualplayfield. Now listen closely
Sprite 0-1 has the greatest priority, Playfield 2 next, then speite 2-3
& finally playfield 1.  Playfield 2 is the bridge & playfield 1 is the
normal road. So untill the car (sprite2) gets to the bridge it has highest
priority. When it gets to the bridge it loses priority to playfield 2 & so
disappears (looks as though it go under the bridge). It then comes out
the other side of playfield 2 & regains priority. Thing get more complicated
when u see the other car (sprite0) travelling across the bridge but I wont
go  into that. See Dave Edwards, ACC6 for more!!

Here is the diagram for the above info
PRIORITY 
	HIGHEST 				  LOWEST
	Sprite0+1   PLAYFIELD 2   SPRITE 2+3    PLAYFIELD 1

 JOYSTICK & MOUSE POINTERS
---------------------------
Just a sprite being moved by mouse or joystick. Done by treebeard (previously
known as Hearwig). Don't ask for more docs please!!

 MULTI-LOAD
------------
As i said our next demo is huge!! We'll need a multi-load system. This is
one attempt!
