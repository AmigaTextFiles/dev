Knipe here. For followers of the series, no excuses this time. I have far
more important things to do than explain why I haven`t done much coding
for three months. (I happen to have my REAL GCSEs in about six weeks, and
that means I must revise like hell, ok?).

I have sent the hard-working Mark a bunch of code for you to ponder over.
Details coming up ..

PP_DISPLAYFILE
A simple program that uses the powerpacker.library to read (and decrunch)
text files. It then dumps the Ascii to the current CLI window, or in my
case the Devpac2 output window. Intended as a short and simple to
understand example of how to use the pp.library. (I worked on it myself
this time, no outside help! Mark mentioned he was going to look at pp some
time, and that was about 3 months ago too, so maybe you are all using it
anyway).

ARP_DISPLAYFILE
Same prog, with the introduction of an Arp requestor to get the filename.
It is actually quite easy to use arp as well. I tried once and managed to
crash something. I tried again about 4 weeks later and this was the result!
Try it folks, Arp is such a wonderful standard.

FUNCTIONKEYMENU / FUNCTIONKEYMENUMUSIC / FUNCTIONKEYMENUMUSICGFX
Three different versions of the same idea. I was asked to write a function
key menu by a friend of mine (Max, now Stooge, he of Dynamic Beats fame)
and this was the result.

It uses a raw key input routine that I asked about ages ago and NO-ONE
HELPED ME!!! If someone has since, thanks! If not, here is the answer to
getting raw input correctly from the keyboard.

There is a bitmap file and a music module to try the versions with. I must
point out that the music was written by Exile's group musician, Professor
Bass, aka Matt Wakeling (who occasionally contributes code too). It is not
PD, and was in fact written for his GCSE music exam in school (guess whos
Amiga got carted along ...). But if you want to use it, credit him. Thanx.

MOVEMOUSE
A short routine to compare a hardware register value. It checks one of the
mouse movement vecs, or possibly both (I can't remember) and if your mousie
moves, the program quits. No more pressing the left rat's eye!!

RAWKEYGET
A simple version of rawkey input. This waits for the RETURN key to be
pressed and then quits back to the CLI. Simple demonstration. As a
sidenote, I have included a Rawkey map picture AND a file from Squidkick
with rawkey values, in case you don't have an expensive manual to look them
up in (I don't).

NOCLICK
Code written by some American. I was going to incorporate some of it in
Squidkick. Who knows, maybe I will someday. Until then, it is an example of
playing with the trackdisc.device, and shuts those fucking drives up too. I
personally spent an extra tenner per drive on fabulous anti-click drives
from Power Computing (plug plug), perhaps I shouldn't have bothered!?

FASTREPLAY
The latest fast version of Mahoney and Kaktus's Noisetracker replay code. I
have just INCLUDEd it in the FunctionKeyMenuMusic/Gfx programs, it is that
simple.

DELTATRACKER.REPLAY
Writen by Matt Wakeling, I have sent this along for anyone who used
DTracker (If you want a copy, just send me a disc and stamp). Deltatracker
is like a clever soundtracker, and the disc I have has 100s of minute
instruments on. The code and any resulting programs are sooooo small that
you find em everywhere, especially in menus, intros and other things.
Sorry no example, I will try to find one later.


That's it for now. When I have finished my GCSEs I get a whole 12! weeks
summer hol before I begin A-levels, so look forward to more from me then.

Take care y'all,
