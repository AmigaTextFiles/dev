PLEA FOR HELP                                                     19 NOV 1990

You could almost guess it would be me really. Well, after Mike Cross`s
suggestion of a help wanted / given section, I have some things that need
explaining.

Plea Number One:
I am working on my first little project, and am having great difficulty with
various things including RAWKEY and gadgets. I have only the Amiga Machine
Language book so this is understandable.
	I have send a piece of code that is supposed to draw an image in a
window. It doesn`t. It is taken straight from the AML book. What I really
want are 2 bitplane gadgets, but the images won`t even work for me at the
moment.

Plea Number Two:
I need to be able to detect key-presses without opening dos windows etc. For
example; how could you exit Zoolook (by Mike Cross) by pressing the spacebar?
Remember that it ditches the multitasking.
	The AML book does give a list of special keys that can be detected
from the hardware register $bfec01, but doesn`t say how to get ordinary keys,
or what their values are if not Ascii.
	Any takers?

Plea Number Three:
How do I detect keypresses in the multitasking environment to trigger a
program, eg: Left Amiga+Escape like PopCLI?


Can anyone supply working code for any of these three? If possible, I could
do with the code in advance, rather than a month later from the next Club
Disc. That would give me a couple of weeks to write something useful! Then
people will see not only the solution, but the whole answer too!

Well, thanks for listening guys and gals.

Told you that you could guess who would be first asking for help.
