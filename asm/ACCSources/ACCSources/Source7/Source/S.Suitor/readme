 The intro shown below is a rehash of an intro by M.Flemans on disc 5. This
shows what can be done with a little thought. Also there is an interesting
tip on how to use some of the hardware registers to generate special effects,
see Colours !

 I have not looked at the blitter scroller properly, anyone else want to work
on this so it will display larger fonts ?

 As a last note, there are two boot loaders for the intro. To use these it is
necessary to assemble them, then stick them on yer boot block. The intro has
to be assembled to $30000 for this to work ( ORG $30000 ).
