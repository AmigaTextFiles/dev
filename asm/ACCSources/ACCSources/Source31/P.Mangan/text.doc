	Dear Mark,
		I just thought I`d drop you a line.I`ve included some code
which plays a sample using the vertical blank as a timer.
 (who needs the cia timers anyway) 
 
 		I thougth I`d better show some support for the ACC disk club
 as it`s only because of it that I`ve become a resonable coder.
 
 ( I`d probable still be trying to open up a screen the legal way racking
  my brains trying to understand the Commodores refference books,etc..)
  
  		I`ve resently upgraded to the 1200 and as you have already
 gussed being a coder that codes the dirty way (not legal) I have encountered
 some problems.Mainly causing the screen to go all wigily (no not the 
 Sheffield Wennesday football player) the screen.It only happens when I 
 run my code from workbench 3.0.If I boot up from my devpav2.0 disk it`s ok.
 
 		I`ve also read with dissatisfation that Commodore are not
 going to release a hardware refference manual (the bible) for the 1200.
 
 		Anyway enough moaning for today
 		Thanks for all the good codeing ref. matreial etc..
 		
 		Yours coding into the night
 		
 			Paul.
