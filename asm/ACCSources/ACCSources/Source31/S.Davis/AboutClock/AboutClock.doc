Distribution

     AboutClock  V2.01 is Shareware  and  NOT  Public Domain, and
as  such  a  small  registration  fee  of 5  pounds  sterling  is
required  if  you  decide  that  AboutClock V2.01  should  be  in
your software collection. This will entitle  you to future  major
upgrades.

     Payment should be in the form of a crossed cheque drawn from
a UK mainland bank payable to the author.

     The  distribution  of   AboutClock  V2.01  MUST  be  intact,
unaltered, and include the following files :

                    AboutClock
                    AboutClock.info
                    AboutClock.doc

Description

     Do you remember the good old days when you asked someone the
time and they  said, "It's nearly five" and not "It's 4:57 and 28
seconds" ?

     Well now there is a Workbench clock that does just that! 

     AboutClock  V2.01  is  an  unobtrusive  clock  that  nestles
neatly at the top  of Workbench, telling  the time  in words in a
window  that  re-sizes  itself  to  account  for  the  length  of
message required.

     Also,  for short-sighted Amiga users, there is the option to
have AboutClock V2.01 speak the time!

     Not  only  is  AboutClock V2.01  simple  and functional, but
it is compatible with all versions of Workbench!

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Usage - CLI/startup-sequence

     type "run" like this to run the program in the background:
     
     run <nil: >nil: path:AboutClock
     
     To enable  AboutClock  to  read  it's  preferences, the icon
     must be present in the  same  directory as the main program.


Usage - WorkBench
      
     Double click the icon. That's all there is to it.
     

     AboutClock  V2.01  will  appear  in  the  top left corner of
the Workbench screen.

     AboutClock  V2.01  now has  two  menus,  PROJECT and SPEECH.

     The Project menu gives the options of ABOUT and QUIT, which
give details of the author, and quit the  program respectively.

     The  Speech  menu  has TIME?... and  SPEECH. Selecting Time?
will  make  AboutClock V2.01 tell you the current time, using the
Amiga's incredible  built in speech  facility, where as selecting
Speech will force  AboutClock V2.01 to tell you the time whenever
it changes. This will be indicated  by a tick next to the option.

     In order to use  the speech option,  it is required that the
following files are present on your setup:

    DEVS:narrator.device
         audio.device (WB1.2/1.3 only.)
            
    LIBS:translator.library
         icon.library
      
If the program fails to  find  these  files it won't allow speech
after telling you the problem. WB2.x users will find all but 1 of
these files on their  original  WB  disks. The audio.device is in
the ROM for these machines.

   * WB3.0 users note :- Commodore have  deemed in their infinite
                         strangeness  not  to  include  the files
                         narrator.device  and  translator.library
                         on the  WB disks!?  Why?  Well I suppose
                         that they decided  they  have power over
                         the Amiga voice  and  wanted  to silence
                         it. (Ahhh...shame on you CBM!)
                         So I have therefore started the anti-CBM
                         RAVe motion, (Return the Amiga's VoicE).
                         This is to persuade  the big C to return
                         the lost library and device files to the
                         poor deprived WB3  users  who have never
                         heard sexy!?!? Paula speak.
                         If you are a  WB3  owner  then the files
                         will work on  your  machine  and all you
                         have to do is get  them from a friend or
                         a PD library. Then you can hear Paula in
                         her proudest moment!(PC owners suck...!)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Icon Tool Types

     AboutClock now checks the  icon for the following recognised
tool types:

        POSX=x        This can be set  to  any number but for the
                      program to open its window, the coords must
                      reside somewhere within the screen.
                      Default=0

        POSY=y        Ditto..

        SPEECH=ON|OFF An "ON" or "on"  will  turn on regular time
                      updates  whenever  the  time  changes.  Any
                      other string value will be ignored.

     
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Development

V1.12
     Some  errors  related to  telling the  time occur at certain
times  of the day.  When  AboutClock  resizes  itself, all active
processes receiving user input on Workbench are  resized, notably
ED  and  SID V1.06, when used under Workbench 1.3 which can prove
to be annoying, but not dangerous.
     This version NOT released to the public.

V1.14
     Tells the correct time without errors.  About and Quit menus
added.  Opens too  large  a  window, and crashes the machine when
About is selected,  under  Workbench 1.3.  No  problems noted for
Workbench 2 and above.
     This version released prior to testing on Workbench 1.3.

V1.14b
     Window  size  corrected,   and  selecting  About  no  longer
crashes  the machine,  but  text  is  not  visible   (applies  to
Workbench 1.3 only).

V1.15
     About  text  is  now  visible.  Error corrected in  telling,
the time around 9am which was detected in V1.14b.

V1.16
     About requester may be selected as often as you wish with no
delay in updating it. 

V2.01
     AboutClock is alive! Version 2.00 includes speech. Also, the
about  requestor  has  been  improved.  It also  works on WB3 but
requires a copy of a narrator.device to be in the Devs directory,
which is not supplied with WB3.

     AboutClock V2.01 was  developed  on  a  HiQ Tower containing
an  Amiga 500  Plus,  4Mb  of  16 Bit Fast RAM, 2Mb Chip RAM, SSL
68020 Accelerator Board with 1Mb of 32 Bit Fast RAM,twin 3.5 inch
disk drives, a 105 Mb, 11ms  Quantum  hard  disc drive, a Citizen 
Swift 24C printer,  two  Zipstick  joysticks, a Technosound Turbo
sampler  and a  Naksha Mouse.  It  was written in 100%  assembler
using the most excellent HiSoft Devpac V3.04. Whew..!!

     For Workbench  1.3  compatibility, it was tested on an Amiga
500 with 4.5Mb 16 bit Fast RAM  and 0.5Mb  Chip RAM switchable to
4Mb  16  bit  Fast RAM  and  1Mb Chip  RAM,  twin  3.5 inch  disk
drives,  42Mb  GVP hard disc drive,  SSL 68020  Accelerator Board
with  1Mb  of  32  bit  Fast RAM  and a  68881 FPU,  and a KCS PC
Emulator.

     For  Workbench 3  compatibility, it was tested on  an  Amiga
1200,  2Mb Chip RAM,  4Mb Fast RAM, 68881 FPU, twin 3.5 inch disk
drives, and a 60Mb hard disc drive.

     Although  not  every  possible configuration of hardware has
been  tested, (send me an A4000T and I will test AboutClock V2.01
on it!), it  is  extremely  unlikely  that  AboutClock V2.01 will
not work on your machine.

     Please report  any errors / problems  to the author when you
register your copy of AboutClock.

College for assistance  with  the  debugging of  the actual code,

and Colin Etwell for the icon,  documentation and beta testing on
his 1.3 Amiga 500.
