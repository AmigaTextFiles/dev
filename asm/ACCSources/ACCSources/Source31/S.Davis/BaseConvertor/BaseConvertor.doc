Description

     These modern calculators are all very nice and that but when
you want to convert  a number  to a  different  base, you have to 
keep pressing shift and  the right  key and then you only get one
number displayed anyway.

     This program solves  these  problems by allowing a number to 
be input in any base  out  of  decimal,  hexadecimal,  binary and
octal. It will check it  for  size and syntax and if all is fine,
it will convert it to the other number bases and display them all
at the same time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Usage

*** N.B...
*** This program requires WB2 or greater due to the use of    ***
*** some WB2 libraries. Sorry to any 1.2(are there any left?) ***
*** /1.3 owners. You'll just have to upgrade!                 ***


Usage - CLI/startup-sequence

     type "run" like this to run the program in the background:
     
     run <nil: >nil: path:BaseConvertor
     

Usage - WorkBench
      
     Double click the icon. That's all there is to it.
     
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions

     BaseConvertor V1.00 will appear on the WorkBench screen.It
has one menu with About and Quit displayed.

     About gives the author and developement details.

     Quit will terminate the program.
      
     To use the program follow the following instructions:
          1. Click on the mx gadget to select the required input
             base.
          2. Click inside the string gadget so that a cursor
             appears.
          3. Now type the number you want converted into the
             gadget. The program will only accept positive values
             which will fit into a 32-bit register and which are
             syntactically correct for the input base.

E.g. Input Base  | Acceptable digits               | Max Value
     ----------  | -----------------               | ---------
     Decimal     | 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9             | 4,294,967,295
     Binary      | 0,1                             | 111111...(x32)
     Octal       | 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7                 | 37777777777
     Hexadecimal | 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f | ffffffff

          4. Press return and if the number is syntactically O.K.
             then it will be converted and displayed into the
             other bases.

Development

V1.00 - 14-3-93
     First internal release. A couple of bugs known of at the
     time but no time due to college to fix them. They weren't
     dangerous anyway and merely involved the conversion routines
     from Decimal-Binary-Decimal and Octal-Binary.

V1.01 - 29-3-93
     First external release. Fully tested on all functions and
     ALL previous bugs fixed.


     BaseConvertor V1.00 was developed on a  HiQ Tower containing
an  Amiga 500  Plus,  4Mb  of  16 Bit Fast RAM, 2Mb Chip RAM, SSL
68020 Accelerator Board with 1Mb of 32 Bit Fast RAM,twin 3.5 inch
disk  drives, a  105 Mb,  11ms  Quantum  hard  disc  drive, a 550
Mb tape  streamer,  a  single  5.25" disk  drive, a Citizen Swift
24C  printer,   two  Zipstick  joysticks,  a  Technosound   Turbo
sampler  and a  Naksha Mouse.  It  was written in 100%  assembler
using the most excellent HiSoft Devpac V3.0. Whew..!!

     The program has been tested on the above machine, a vanilla
A500, an A3000 and is known to work on an A1200. No problems with
68040 processors known of either.

     Although  not  every  possible configuration of hardware has
been tested,(send me an A4000 and I will test BaseConvertor V1.00
on it!), it is extremely unlikely  that  BaseConvertor V1.00 will
not work on your machine.

     Please report  any errors / problems  to the author when you
register your copy of BaseConvertor.

     [ If you don't register, you can't moan ]


     Thanks go to  Danilo Sandron for  help with the decimal-bin-
decimal conversion. We  got  these  routines  finished at 3am one
morning while pissed out of our heads. The  code is only 16 lines
long for each one.!
     Thanks also to Jan van den Baard for the brilliant and free
GadToolsBox V1.4. Using this interface generator saved me typing
over 1000 lines of code.
