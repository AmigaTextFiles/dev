 Disclaimer
 ==========
 I make no gaurentees as to the suitability or reliability of this program.

 Use this program at your own risk. I will accept no responsability for
damage caused, or data lost, as a result of running the program. By running
the program you are agreeing to these terms.

 Usage
 =====
 Use from the CLI only!

 DumpSprite <filename>

		<filename> must be an IFF-ILBM as explained below.

		<filename>.s will be created.

 Function
 ========

 DumpSprite will convert suitable IFF-ILBM files into assembly source code.

 The source IFF file should contain an image not wider that 16 pixels and
consisting of either 4 or 16 colours.

 A corresponding source file will be created containing Simple Sprite
structures ready for inclusion into your larger project. The Simple Sprite
structures are complete, ie two blank control words have been added at the
start and a terminating long word added to the end.

 In the case of a 16 colour sprite, two Simple Sprite structures will be
created. If you do not know the reason for this, then this utility is
probably of little use to you :-)

 Notes
 =====

 Look as I may, I could not find a utility that would convert a brush
created by DPaint into source code for a sprite that could be used in an
assembly language program.

 Though little problems are encountered designing simple 4 colour sprites,
things get involved when working with 16 colour sprites. This program can
handle both! 

 Feedback
 ========

 This program will only be of use to a few people out there. If you are one
of them and would like to see an improved version then write to me.
