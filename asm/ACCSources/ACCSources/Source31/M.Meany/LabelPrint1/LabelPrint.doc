 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Have you ever wanted to produce your own, unique, disk labels? I have!
Blank, tractor fed, 3.5 inch disk labels are realatively inexpensive, around
£7.00 per 1000 label roll at the time of writing. So why not do it I said to
myself.

 A lengthy search of many a PD list and equally dissapointing replies from
good PD contacts later led me to the conclusion that there was no a simple
to use graphic label printing utility available in the realms of PD. Hmmm!

 A few hours of sweating over that ever enthusiastic assembler, Devpac, and
I had a useable utility. Well for my purposes anyway! A program that could
load IFF brushes created in DPaint and print them onto labels. Bliss! "A
program that deserves to be unleashed upon the world of PD enthusiasts" I
remember saying to myself!

 So there it is in a nutshell! The demise of a fiendish label printer!

 This simple utility may not be the end of things as we know them! I have
since purchased a lazer printer ( falls around in orgasmic ecstasy ) and
now realise how much it is lacking, the utility that is. With the amount of
time put into it, what did I expect?

 It would appear that there are no end of uses that a flexible printing
utility could be put to. For instance, printing labels for home made wine
( as suggested by a red nosed relative of mine, while describing the
necessity to pick dandelions well away from urban areas to reduce the risk
of suffering toxic shock after twelve months fermentation ). This particular
relative had plans of producing labels bearing a comic charecture of his
face surrounded by verse pronouncing his 'brew' as nectre of the gods
curtesy of 'Chateau de Bassett'. As one who has never turned his hand to
the art of fermenting the spoils of natures, who am I to comment?

 If I ever get around to completing it, the sucessor to LabelPrint will
allow IFF files of any dimension to be loaded and dumped to a printer, in
splendid technicolour if one posesses a suitable printer ( I will be
experimenting with a Citizen Swift 24 Colour ).

 I hope the past fifty five lines served as a pleasant means of passing the
time. I will now digress and explain how to operate the utility accompanying
this text.
 
 Usage
 ~~~~~
 LabelPrint is VERY basic in operation. It will allow you to load brushes
saved from most paint packages and then print these to tractor fed disk
labels. You may then proceed by sticking the label onto a floppy disk, a
very pleasing pastime I am told.

 The only restriction, approaching strangulation, is that the IFF brush
must be of the following dimensions: 200x90x2. For the hard of hearing that
means 200 pixels wide, 90 pixels high and 2 planes deep ( or 4 colour for
those familiar with DPaint terminology ). 
 
 Before running LabelPrint you should complete the following checklist
which has been provided to prevent dissapointment:

	1. Make sure you have some IFF brushes saved from a paint program
	   to hand. These must be 200x90x2.
	1. Make sure you have a printer.
	2. Make sure you have a printer connected to your computer.
	3. Make sure you have some tractor fed disk labels (a).
	4. Make sure the labels are correctly positioned in your printer.
	5. Make sure your printer is online.

 If you cannot satisfy the above criteria, consider one of the following
courses of action:

	1. Give the program away ( Yes, it's PD and you can do this ).
	2. Buy a printer, this seldom fails.
	3. Buy and attach a suitable lead to connect printer to computer.
	4. Buy some tractor fed labels (a), this is as foolproof as 2.
	5. Feed labels into printer, can be tricky so beware.
	6. Put your printer online, it will then begin a symbiotic
	   relationship with your computer that can be a joy to behold!
	7. Seek help! The dent in your pride will be negligible when
	   compared to the self humilliation brought on whenever your
	   "stupid" computer gets the better of you. Everyones been there
	   and there's generations more yet to come!

 (a) Blank, tractor fed labels can be obtained from SeaSoft Computing whos
address and phone number I have included at the end of this document. It
may seem odd that Amiganuts should recommend another company, but we have
our reasons. We have found SeaSoft to be very competative as far as price
is concerned, but most important helpful and honest! We sincerely recommend
that you try them for all your computer accessories and are confident you
will not feel wronged by this advice. Please feel free to correct us on
this issue, but we doubt you will have the need!

 Back to the program in question, or why bother because I've had too much
to drink and need a rest. Is it not sad that a man disassosiate himself
from reality in order to deal with it.
