			Animating A Logo In A Window
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Why? Well I'm not quite sure!
 
 The idea is simple enough. Display a logo or graphic in your window and then
animate it. If your program was some form of menu or utility then this would
be a nice touch.

 The code has been designed to tag into any program and can handle animations
of different length. All this is achieved by using a custom structure defined
in 'WinAnim.i'.

 How It Works
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The actual display routine uses the function ClipBlit() to draw the graphic
into a specified RastPort. It is up to the calling program to supply the
destination RastPort and x,y coordinates at which to display a frame.

 ClipBlit() requires source and destination RastPorts. For this reason, I
included a routine called A_InitAnim that will create a RastPort and BitMap
for the animation. A_InitAnim should be called as follows:

 error = A_InitAnim( AnimStruct )
  d0                     a0
 
 The AnimStruct is shown below:

mam_Width	LONG		Width of image in pixels - You fill this in
mam_Height	LONG		Height of image          - You fill this in
mam_Depth	LONG		depth of display         - You fill this in
mam_Rp		LONG		filled in by A_InitAnim
mam_Bm		LONG		filled in by A_InitAnim
mam_Frame	LONG		Pointer into vector table- You fill this in

 The mam_Frame field should point to a list of pointers. Each pointer in the
list will point to the graphics for the next frame of the animation.

 So at the start of your code call A_InitAnim with a pointer to a part filled
AnimStruct, hopefully d0 will be non zero on return.

 Now whenever you want to display a new frame, call the routine A_NextFrame
routine with the following parameters:

 A_NextFrame( AnimStruct, RastPort, x, y )
                  a0         a1    d0 d1

 RastPort should be a pointer to the RastPort into which you want the
animation to be displayed. A_NextFrame will automatically advance the frame
pointer for you.

 At the end of your code call A_FreeAnim to release the RastPort and BitMap
created by A_InitAnim.

 There is a rather crude example that runs from IntuiTicks supplied so you
can get the general idea!
