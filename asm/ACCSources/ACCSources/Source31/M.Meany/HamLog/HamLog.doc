			HamLog Source Notes
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 A couple of my friends are Ametuer Radio users and wanted a log book
program written. Well I've not had much time free of late, but this is the
starting point of the program. At present I've only added Operator handling
code and have not yet progressed onto the log propper. The source has been
included as an example of how to use the Random.i include file for
accessing Random Access Files.

 When complete, full source for this program will be made available.

								Mark.
