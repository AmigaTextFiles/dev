 Decrunch.s
 ==========

 This is an example of using Nico Francois stand alone decrunch routine. The
reason I have included this is a number of people have been asking for a
means of storing a number of crunched item within a program. When required
the appropriate item is decrunched into a common buffer.

 For example, a program may containn five crunched pics ( bitmaps ) only
one of which is displayed at any one time. The bitmaps would all be
crunched and incbin'd into the source and Nico's routine used to decrunch
the appropriate bitmap when required.

 Menu
 ====
 The complete source for this menu program.

 Note, the Menu.s file should be assembled as 'Linkable' to disk and linked
with the following files:

	text.o, play.o and ILBM.o

 The sources for these modules have appeared on previous disks in on form
or another. I may have tagged a decrunch routine onto the front of some of
them to provide for powerpacked routines, but that's about all.

 Sorry the code is so untidy and sprawled out. The reason is that it was
written in a hurry and I have never returned to tidy it up. If anyone does
tidy the code up, add new features or find serious bugs then please tell
me!

 RequesterTest
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Well, after doing a tutorial on reading DOS lists, I decided I'd better
start the ball rolling with a file requester. I ran out of time
unfortunately, so this is not a finished version.

 It will let you select a file, but it's very crude. The window is not even
finished off yet and there seems to be a bug in the GetVolList routine that
sometimes causes only a partial listing of all volumes.

 Anyway, it's as good a starting point as any!

 That's it for now, MM.
