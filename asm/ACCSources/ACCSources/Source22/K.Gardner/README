	Hi mark
	
		Here is my contribution to your coders club.
	It is a small program designed around bouncing copper
	bars ( but with a slight difference ), i hope it is
	good enough to be included on your disks.
		I have supplied you with the source code and
	a executable program.
		Assembled using DEVPAC2.

	HELP REQUIRED.

		I have also included source code called bob.s
	which should place a bob onto to screen but for some
	reason it doesn't seem to work.
		Any chance you can tell me why ????.

 See the HelpMe section Kevin. MM
	
	

				Bye
