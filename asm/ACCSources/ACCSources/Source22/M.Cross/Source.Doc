 Source docs.
 
 Warning.  I now use Devpac 3 header files when assembling.  If you are
 using Devpac 2 you will probably have little success in assembling any
 of these routines without adding a big list of the required include
 files to the beginning of the source.  Devpac 3 users should also be
 warned.  I have added ALL of the hardware include files to my system.gs
 header on my Depvac 3 disk, and I have also set the label 'Custom'
 to equal $dff000 in my header file.  I advise you to either :-
 
 a) Do the same  or
 b) Add the custom.i, dmabits.i and blit.i includes to the include path.
 

 Vertical coppers.
 
 This simple little routine uses inverse bitplane modulo's to make a one
 line object fill the screen.  The main routine draws a table of sine
 bobs to the top line of the screen and the system DMA does the rest.
 If you don't believe me, change the bitplane modulo back to zero.


 Huge scroller intro.
 
 This is quite old and I was in two minds about sending it.  As you can see
 I did!   A simple intro which features a massive scroller with each letter
 scaled upto 256 x 256 pixels square!  I wrote a little utility which takes
 a standard Powerfonts16 font and scales it into the giant font data that
 makes the huge letters.  Upper and lower case letters can be used.  The
 program uses dual playfields and is pretty un-optimised.  Really I should
 have used a bplcon1 scroll rather than having the blitter do all the
 hard work.  If you like the big scroller and want some more fonts let
 me know and I will send the font scale utility to ACC.


 Dot plotter V1.0.
 
 Another old routine.  This is a single frame routine that plots dots on 
 the screen in a sine pattern.  The actual plot routine is tiny and could
 easily be used to plot pixel starfields etc.  To change the pattern,
 simply alter the X_Add and Y_Add size equates at the start of the code.
 Be warned though, the X and Y add values should ALWAYS be even numbers. 
 Odd numbers WILL crash the program.  This routine is old and the sine
 bits are pretty simple.  To optimise the routine you should :-
 
 a) Use a 'true' sine table.
 b) Instead of clearing the entire display every frame, the routine should
    only clear each individual dot.  This would allow a lot more dots to
    be plotted in a single frame.
 
 
 Starfield subroutine.
 
 This is a small subroutine which can be used to put a simple sprite 
 starfield into your programs.  Remeber to enable sprites by setting
 DMAF_SPRITE in the dmacon register else nothing will be displayed.
 There are comments explaining where everything goes.
 

 Bubble sort.

 A simple list sorting routine.  It compares items in a list and swaps
 each consecutive item which was smaller than the previous item.  


 That is all!
