AMIGA CODERS CLUB DISKS / AMIGA CODERS MANUAL DISKS -- PRESERVATION PROJECT
===========================================================================
This is a preservation collection of Amiga Coders Club disks. They were imaged directly from
the original disks as shipped by Amiganuts UK in the early 1990s.

This preservation project originates from the English Amiga Board:  http://eab.abime.net
The relevant thread is here: http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=2831

ACC was mainly geared towards Amiga 68k assembly language programming (both hardware and
system code).

Disks 1-4 were freely available (though not public domain) and were distributed separately
on four different disks. When Amiganuts took over distribution after disk 4 they decided to
merge the contents of the first four disks to create a "compact" disk (they didn't distribute
the original 4 disks themselves). Maybe someone else can add the original first 4 full disks
to the collection but the compact disk essentially has all the important files on it.

After disk 4 ACC became a commercial product and was exclusively distributed by Amiganuts UK
(and apparently later by an Australian office).

This collection includes compact disks 1-4 (1 disk) and disks 5-32 of the commercial releases.
Note that disks 12 and 29 came as two parts: disks 12A/B and 29A/B. 

Amiganuts later released the "Amiga Coders Manual" (ACM) series which was designed to augment
the ACC disks but was more entry-level oriented. These were created by the same people responsible
for the ACC disks. This package includes ACM disks 1-3 and another non-exclusive ACM disk.


FAQ
===
Q. How many ACC disks were produced?
A. I have no idea. Disk 32 was the last one ordered from Amiganuts. Possibly there are more.
   If so, please add them to this archive!


Q. How many ACM disks were produced?
A. I have no idea. Disk 4 was the last one ordered from Amiganuts. Possibly there are more.
   If so, please add them to this archive!
  

USER PARTICIPATION
==================
If you have more information to add, please go to the EAB forum. Anyone can contribute to this
preservation project -- this initial archive is just a seed archive based on the incomplete
collection of one person who is not going to maintain this archive himself.

* Add extra/updated/corrected info to this archive
* Add missing disks
* Add different versions of the disks (once verified that they are original variations)
* Only add ORIGINAL disk images. This is after all a preservation project...

   If you saved your first fumblings in 68k programming to disk 33, we really don't need it :-)
   If you have a disk which is not represented here but you think might not be "prestine"
   then add it to the collection but mark it as non-original. That way people will know that
   it exists and can hopefully replace it with an original image.


CATALOG
=======
Included is the Amiganuts catalog disk at the time ACC disk 32 was shipped. I'm sure this can
be updated to a much later catalog.


NOTES
=====
The following text is included for search engines. It is the contents list for disks 1-31
which was taken from disk 32 (the contents lists always referred to PREVIOUS disks in the
series).

ACC Disks £3.5O
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ACC is a monthly disk magazine for assembly language programmers. It started
out as a means for beginners to swap ideas and help each other out. Advice
is offered by the more experienced programmers and the disks are filled with
source, tutorials, utilities and letters.

 If you want to learn assembler, to kick ideas around with someone, or have
experience that you want to pass on then take a look. The disk is released
once a month.

ACC Disk Contents To Date ( Back issues £3.5O )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The following summary of the ACC collection was compiled by one of the
contributors and we have decided to leave in all his comments: honesty is
the best policy!

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This file contains brief details of the contents of past ACC disks.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ACC 1		March 1990
  -----		----------

  NOTE:  This disk is NOT licensed to Amiganuts united and may be freely
  distributed without fear of repacussions.  To obtain a copy of this
  issue (but why?) contact Mark Meany at the address given below.

  The first ACC disk was mainly a `taster' issue and did not contain
  any tutorials or contributed source code.  The menu system used was
  WorkBench.  The majority of the sources would not assemble as specialist
  include file were not included (for legal reasons I think)  Also, Mark
  had neglected to specify the data hunks as chip ram thus rendering
  one Meg + users unable to view some of the `startup' examples.
 
  Tutorials -»	None.

  Source    -»  Various simple hardware, copper and bitplane routines
  		from Mark Meany.  Also source from a Compute! book and
  		a McGraw Hill book.  Mainly simple 68000 routines.

  Utilities -»	Preferences!

  possibly the most awkward ACC menu of all time.

  At last; after seventeen issues ACC gets a decent menu system!  The new
