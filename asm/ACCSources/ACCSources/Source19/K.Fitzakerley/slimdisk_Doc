WHAT IS SLIM DISK

    Each week I conduct a CLI group from my home, a lessons was being
  conducted on how to create a small bootable WorkBench via the cli, this
  task involved quite a bit of typing ! This point was raised during the
  Cli session.

    One of the attending students made a comment that it would be a lot
  easier if you could just type one word in the Cli and everything else
  was done by the computer.

    I thought about this for a while and before long I was writing a program
  to achieve this task, and so emerged SlimDisk.

    This version requires two drive (DF0) & (DF1), I am working on a single
  drive version of the same program for everone out there with only one
  drive.

USAGE

    The SlimDisk program needs to be copied to the C directory of a standard
    workbench disk (V1.3) as the program needs to execute and copy certain
    files.

    To run SlimDisk.

    Place a blank disk in DF1:

    Open a Shell or Cli and type SlimDisk

    SlimDisk, will open it's own window and will firstly format the disk
    in DF1:, when formated it will then beging to create all the nessasary
    directorys and proceed to copy the required files, when complete there
    will be a message displayed indicating that SlimDisk has completed,
    after a 12 second wait SlimDisk will close and return you to the Shell
    or Cli from which it was launched.

    After SlimDisk has finished creating the boot disk in DF1: remove all
    disks and reboot your Amiga with your newly created SlimDisk, you can
    now add what ever programs you like to this disk.
