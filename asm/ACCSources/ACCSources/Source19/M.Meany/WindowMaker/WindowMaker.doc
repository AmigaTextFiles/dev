                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
 Function 
 ~~~~~~~~ 
    WindowMaker is a utility designed to simplify the creation of source code 
for an Intuition Window. At present  only  Devpac2  assembly source format is 
supported, but this will be  improved  on  to  cover A68K assembly format and 
also a C format. 
 
    Using this program  you  can  design  an  Intuition  window  to  your own 
requirements. Setting  the  appropriate  IDCMP  and window flags. The correct 
position, width and height. The correct pen colours. The correct title. 
 
    All this is achieved by simple menu  and  gadget selection. At most times 
the window you are designing  is  displayed  for  you,  this means you get it 
right first time. 
 
    The biggest advantage is that the source is ready for inclusion into your  
program. No longer do you need to  keep  referring  to books when designing a 
window. 
 
    Projects may  be  saved  for  later  use.  If  you  decide  to  alter the 
appearance of your window, simply  load  it back into WindowMaker and off you 
go. 
 
 Starting 
 ~~~~~~~~ 
    The program can be run from the CLI  by  typing  it`s name. No parameters 
are required and none are  supported.  Once  started  in this way the program 
frees itself from the CLI. 
 
    The program may also be started from the  WorkBench by double-clicking on 
it`s icon. 
 
 The Two Windows 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    The program starts by opening  two  windows,  a  Status window and a User 
window. The Status window is used by  the  program to report progress back to 
you. There is a single pull down menu  available  from  the Status window and 
the functions supported from this will be covered shortly. 
 
    The User window is a representation of the  window you are designing. The 
program initially opens a default  window  for  you that is equipped with all 
the standard Intuition gadgets. 
 
    The size and position of the User window  are reflected in the source the 
program generates for your window, so you  may move and re-size the window to 
your own requirements. 
 
 The Status Line 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    The program communicates the  success/failure  of  all operations through 
the Status window. All operations  accessed  through  the pull-down menu will 
cause a message to be displayed in this window. The status will normally read 
`Ok.`. Some routines, such  as  disc  operations,  will  expand  on  this and 
confirm an action. Below is a  list  of  all  current  messages followed by a 
brief explanation. 
 
    `Ok.` 
    This message is used to inform you that no errors have occurred. 
 
    `Could not open a new window for editing.` 
    This message will appear if memory is sparse  and the program cannot open 
a User window for you to manipulate. 
 
    `Could not form a correct pathname from selection!` 
    This message is displayed due to misuse of the file requester. 
 
    `Operation aborted, CANCEL selected!` 
    If you select the cancel gadget  to  abort  a  Load/Save  operation, this 
message will be displayed. 
 
    `Could not open Edit window.` 
    If you select Edit from  the  pull-down  menu,  but there is insufficient 
memory for the program to open the Edit window, this message is displayed. 
 
    `Could not open file for writing.` 
    There was a problem trying to open a  raw  data  file to save your window 
definition into. One of a  number  of  reasons  could  cause  this message to 
appear: 
              1/ The disc was write protected. 
              2/ A file with the same name exists and is protected from 
                deletion. 
              3/ A file with the same name exists and is already open. 
              4/ The pathname you specified was incorrect, eg. typing df3: 
                with only one external drive attached. 
 
    `Could not open file for reading.` 
    This message will usually appear if the  raw data file you specified does 
not exist, though it may be the file is protected against reading. 
 
    `Could not open source file for writing.` 
    When attempting to save a source  file,  the file you specified could not 
be opened. The reasons for this could be one of the following: 
 
              1/ The disc was write protected. 
              2/ A file with the same name exists and is protected from 
                deletion. 
              3/ A file with the same name exists and is already open. 
              4/ The pathname you specified was incorrect, eg. typing df3: 
                with only one external drive attached. 
 
    `Load aborted, not a WindowMaker data file!` 
    When trying to load a raw data file,  you  have  specified a file that is 
not compatible with the program.  WindowMaker  saves a header at the start of 
all raw data files so it can recognise them at a later date. 
 
    `Data file saved Ok.` 
    Informing you that the data file has been saved. 
 
    `Source file saved Ok.` 
    Informing you the source file has been successfully generated. 
 
    `Opened new window for editing.` 
    Informs you that a User window has been  opened. This should be displayed 
after New or Load have been selected from the pull-down menu. 
 
    `Programmed by Mark Meany, © December 91.` 
    This is displayed when About is selected from the pull-down menu. 
 
 The Pull-Down Menu 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    WindowMaker has only one menu,  the  Project  menu.  It is from this menu 
that all the required function are accessed. Below is a list of the functions 
available at present: 
 
              New            Trashes the User window being worked on and 
                             supplies a new default window. 
 
              Edit           Allows you to edit the User windows fields. 
 
              Load           Loads a previous project. 
 
              Save           Saves the current window in a format that can 
                             be loaded back at a later date. 
 
              Save Source    Generates an assembly source file for inclusion 
                             into your program. 
 
              About          My calling card! 
 
              Quit           Exits the program. 
 
    I will now cover each option in more detail. 
 
 New 
 ~~~ 
    To scrap the window you  are  currently  editing,  use this function. The 
current window is replaced with the default window displayed when the program 
first starts. 
 
    WARNING :- There is no confirmation  mechanism  on this option, selecting 
it will loose the window being edited. 
 
 Edit 
 ~~~~ 
    This is where the program saves the most time. Selecting this option will  
cause a full screen window to  open.  This  window  contains numerous gadgets 
that define the characteristics of your window. 
 
    There are two banks of gadgets, one  for  IDCMP  flags and one for Window 
Flags. All selected  gadget  mean  that  field  is  required in the assembler 
source. 
 
    As well as the two banks, there are also a number of Text/Integer gadgets 
that allow you to specify the name, width,  height, max & min width and max & 
min height. I hope this is obvious from the display! 
 
    There are also CANCEL and OK gadgets.  Selecting  CANCEL will restore the 
window you were working on prior to selecting Edit, selecting OK will cause a  
new window to be displayed that echos the requirements you defined. 
 
    NOTE :-  There is no mechanism  for  user  confirmation  written for this 
routine! The window originally being edited is lost. 
 
    Also note that IDCMP flags may be  specified,  but are not catered for in 
the window displayed. They are saved out as part of the code however. 
 
 Load 
 ~~~~ 
    To make development of programs  easier,  you  can load/save intermediate 
projects. A window is saved in a format  that WindowMaker will recognise at a 
later date. 
 
    The ARP file requester is used to allow  easy selection of a name for the 
data file that will be saved. I assume that all programmers are familiar with 
the use of this requester! 
 
 Save 
 ~~~~ 
    To save your work in a format that can be  loaded back at some later date 
use this option. Again the ARP file requester is used to allow easy selection 
of the data file to load. 
 
    Attempting to load a file not created by  WindowMaker will cause an error 
message to be displayed. 
 
    When the file has loaded, the window  currently  being edited is scrapped 
and the window defined by  the  raw  data  file  is  displayed.  If Cancel is 
selected from the file requester, the  window  currently being edited will be 
preserved. 
 
    WARNING :- There is no confirmation  mechanism  on this option, selecting 
it will loose the window being edited. 
 
 Save Source 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    When you are happy with your creation  and  wish to put it to use, select 
this option. The ARP file requester is displayed  to allow you to specify the 
name of the file to create. 
 
    The source code generated is also  commented  so if you do need to make a 
minor alteration, it can be done by using  a simple text editor as opposed to 
having to reload WindowMaker. 
 
 About 
 ~~~~~ 
 This is a simple ego trip! 
 
 Quit 
 ~~~~ 
 An alternative way of exiting from the program, changes are ignored. 
 
 
 
    I hope you find this file useful in creating Intuitiøn windows, 
 
 
                                            Mark.
