                    HexKey

        Learning MC68000 assembly language is not an easy task.
The following is a description of a program I wrote in order to
help me understand how the hardware register 'BFEC01' worked.
In my 'AMIGA Machine Language' book it is described as the
register where the last special key pressed is saved. But this
program demonstrates that it does much more than that. It is
not limited to the special keys at all, each key on the keyboard
has not one, but two unique values that can be interpreted
by your programs. As you press the key, one value is stored in
'BFEC01', and as you release the key, a different value is stored
in 'BFEC01'. The following table shows the values for PRESSing
keys, simply subtract 1 to get the RELEASE value for that key.

                   Important!

        To run this program properly, after the window appears
click the left mouse button in some other window or on a disk
icon, or keyboard entries will have a double effect which will
make reading the values difficult.
