 ~~~~~~~~~~
 You  use  this  software  at  your  own  risk.  Neither  the  programmer  nor
distributor of this software can be  held  responsible for it's actions. Every
attempt has been made to ensure that the  program performs satisfactorily, but
this is not a guarantee that it will do in all situations.

 Requirements
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 o An Amiga running  Workbench 2.04 or higher.
 o powerpacker.library,  Nico Francois.
 o A Printer.
 o CMD to be available.

 CMD is a program supplied with  Workbench  2.04 and higher. It allows you to
redirect output destined for the parallel  or serial device to a file on disk.
This file may later be copied to either SER: or PAR: to produce a hard copy.

 Desirables
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 o 1Mb+ of memory.
 o A hard drive.
 o A copy of PowerPacker,  Nico Francois.

 Purpose
 ~~~~~~~
 To speed up printing of those repetitive forms.

 Usage
 ~~~~~
 Double-click the icon  from  the  Workbench  or  run  from  the Shell with no
parameters:

1>CMDController

 What It Does
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This program performs two tasks:  It  lets  you  catch data intended for your
printer and save it to  a  file  on  disk  and  it  also  lets you print these
captured files.

 Why? To be honest, because I was asked to write it! Well anyone familiar with
DTP ( or drawing ) programs on the Amiga  will know how long it takes to print
a file. Most of the time is taken up by  the DTP program scaling graphics laid
out on screen to a WYSIWYG image for your  printer. Now if you have files that
you regularly print the last thing  you  want   to do is keep loading your DTP
program in order to print them .... enter CMD controller.

 How Do I Capture What's Being Printed?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 o You run CMD controller before printing anything.
 o You run the application that is going to do the printing.
 o Switch Windows/Screens so that you can get to CMD Controller.
 o Hit the 'Set' gadget so you can define a file to save the printer data to.
 o Hit the 'Grab' gadget initiate printer data interception.
 o Switch back to the application and initiate a print.
 o When the application has finished printing, you will have the file you
   require!

 If you own PowerPacker,  Nico  Francois,  you can pack the files created by
CMD controller. CMD Controller uses  powerpacker.library  to load files it has
captured, thus ensuring that packed  files  can  be loaded. Files generated by
CMD are packed quite impressively by PowerPacker, usually better than 40%!

 How Do I Print A Captured File?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 o Run CMD Controller.
 o Hit the 'Print Files' gadget.
 o Select the file(s) captured earlier using the file requester¹.
 o When you hit the 'Ok' gadget, your files will be printed.

¹ With the ASL file requester you can select more than one file by holding
  down the 'SHIFT' key  while selecting  the filenames from the list. When
  you have finished selecting  files, release the 'SHIFT' key and click on
  the 'Ok' gadget to commence printing.

 The file selector that appears when you  select 'Print Files' can be used to
select more than one file for  printing.  Simply hold down the shift key while
selecting file names and the files will be collectively selected. If selecting
more than one file, bear in mind  that  they  will  be printed in alphabetical
order.

 What Do The Gadgets Do?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Print Files    - Allows you to select captured files for printing.

Copies         - Allows you to specify how many copies of each file to print.

Printing       - Shows name of file being printed.

Set File       - Allows you to specify the name of the file that printer
                 output will be saved to.

Grab           - Starts redirection from the printer to the file name you
                 specified using the 'Set File' gadget.

Parallel/Serial- Allows you to specify what port your printer is connected
                 to ... Read your Amiga manual for more information, or
                 drop me a line!

About          - Boring details about the program.

Quit           - If I need to explain this, don't bother clicking the icon!

 There are also two string fields  that  show  (a)  The name of the file being
printed and (b) the  name  of  the  file  being  captured.  I  hope that their
position makes it obvious which is which!

 Workbench Tool Types.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Yep! The CMDController icon can be given Tool Types. Two are accepted, one to 
tell the program what port your printer  is connected to and the other to tell
the program where to find CMD on your system. You do not have to set either of 
these Tool Types, but they can save you time!

DEV=<device>   Specify what device the printer is connected to. Accepted
               values are SER: and PAR:. The program defaults to PAR: if
               this Tool Type is omitted, though this can be changed once
               the program is running.


               EG.     DEV=PAR:
                       DEV=SER:

DIR=<path>     Specify in which drawer CMD can be located. Accepts any valid
               path. NOTE: CMD will usually be found in the Sys:System drawer
               and this is what the program defaults to. If the program fails
               to find CMD it gives you the option of locating it instead!

               EG.     DIR=SYS:Devs
                       DIR=df1:Tools/Printer
                       DIR=Utils:

 Uses.
 ~~~~~
 o If you print your own labels of any kind, this program WILL save you time.
 o If you do not own a printer but use someone else's, this program WILL save
   you both time. You can capture a file, take it to your mates and then print
   it.
 o You can print from programs without having a printer connected.
 o You can print things to disk using a friends computer, go home and copy
   them to your printer as often as you like without owning the program that
   produced the initial printout -- talk nicely to your local printing bureau
   or friend with ProPage4, PageStream, Final Copy......
 o Need your CV in a hurry for that important vacancy...........

 As an example, a friend of mine uses PageStream to design forms etc. Now when
it comes to printing, PageStream takes 15 mins on his humble A500+. Using this
program output is redirected to a file on hard drive, which takes about 6 mins
and then the file is copied  to printer which  takes a further 1 min. Net time
for printing has been reduced from 15 mins to around 7 mins:-)

 Demonstration.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This doc file has been captured  on  a  system  using  the  'Generic' printer
driver, thename of the captured  file  is  'CMDControllerDoc.CMD'.  This  file
should be printable on any printer:

 o Run CMDController.
 o Hit the 'Print Files' gadget.
 o Select the file 'CMDControllerDoc.CMD'.

 The file should be printed for you!

 Registration.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Like this program? If so, why not  register  for a complete version that does
not restrict the number of files  to  2  and  the  number of copies to 1, send
5.00 cash or Postal Order to:

 Miss T.S. Meany,
 216 Bluebell Road,
 Southampton,
 Hants.

 As well as an unrestricted version of this  program you will also gain access
to laser  printed  copies  of  your  work.  Full  details  supplied  with  the
registered copy of the program!

 o Paul Clasby for the idea.
 o Nico Francois for PowerPacker and powerpacker.library.
 o Jaba Development for GadToolsBox: Used to design the interface for this
   utility,
 o Peter Simons for BumpRevisionDeluxe, used to track all my code these days.
 o Paul, Dave & Nola for support and their efforts beta testing this program.

 Known Bugs.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 o Will not run on pre-WB2.04, so this is yet another reason to upgrade.
 o If the path is set for CMD incorrectly you are asked to locate CMD. The
   program does not validate that you have selected CMD, just that a valid
   file has been selected.
