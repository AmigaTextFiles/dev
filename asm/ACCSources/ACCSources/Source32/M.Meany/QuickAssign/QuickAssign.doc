 Disclaimer
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 I accept no responsibility for the performance of this program. By using this
program you are accepting full responsibility for the consequences.

 Distribution
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This program is Freeware. It may be distributed on any disk for which no more 
than a nominal copying fee is charged.  I  base 'nominal' on the current price
of a Fred Fish disk.

 The following files make up the complete distribution and may not be split:

 QuickAssign                   The program.
 QuickAssign.info              The programs icon.
 QuickAssign.doc               This doc file.
 QuickAssign.doc.info          This files icon.
 QuickAssignSource.lha         The assembly source for the program.

 Requirements
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Workbench 2 or higher.
 The assign file must be in your sys:c directory.

 What Is It?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 QuickAssign is a small  utility  that  allows  you  to  make assigns from the
Workbench. The process is  simplified  by  allowing  you  to select the target
directory/device using a file requester.

 Any assigns made can optionally be added to your s:user-startup file

 This utility was written so that  I  could  copy  an application onto my hard
drive and quickly make all the assigns  required  to launch it from wherever I
put it. If I intend to  keep  the  utility  then  I  could  have these assigns
written to my user-startup file.

 Usage
 ~~~~~
 The program can be launched from the CLI  or WorkBench. Not parameter parsing
takes place, so don't bother wasting time experimenting!

 The program is controlled entirley by gadgets,  all of which are visible when
the program is first launched. Below  is  a  quick run through of each gadgets
function:

Assign         This is where you type in the assignment you intend to make.
               You should add the colon to the end of the assign yourself, the
               program does not check this. You have been warned!

               Once you have typed in the name of the assignment, a requester
               will appear which you can use to select the drawer/device that
               the assign will be made to.

Add to user-startup

               This is a toggle gadget. When 'ticked', all the assigns you
               make will be added to your user-startup file. This means that
               when ever you switch your machine on the assigns will be made
               for you.

 Notes
 ~~~~~
 If the program encounters an error it  will  attempt to tell you about it. If
you do not have a user-startup (  why  not?  )  the  program will give you the
option of creating one.

 As of Workbench 2 all of your  specific  assigns  etc. should be added to the
user-startup file, not the  startup-sequence.  During  the course of executing
the  startup-sequence  the   existence   of  user-startup  is  checked.  If  a
user-startup file exsists, it will be executed by the startup-sequence.

 Suggestions
 ~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you have any suggestions to make  about  this program than send them to me
at the address below. I cannot  guarantee  that I will act on them, it depends
on my work load at the time.

 Thanks and Credits
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Credit must go to Jan van den Baard, Jaba Developments, for GadToolsBox which 
I used to design the user interface for  this program. Check Fred Fish for the
latest version of this excellent  programmers  tool, or send me a disk and sae
for an archived copy.

 I must also mention Peter Simons for  his  BumpRevisionDeluxe  utility that I
use to keep track of all my source  code.  This is also freeware and available
from me by sending a disk and sae to address below.

 Thanks to Paul Clasby for beta testing. If things go wrong blame him :-)

 My Address
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 Any mail concerning  my  programming  projects  should  be  sent to me at the
following address. I need to keep my  own  mail  separate from Amiganuts, so I
have obtained a PO Box. Sorry, I will  no  longer be releasing my home address
as my family do not share my passion for computers :-(

 Mail can be sent to me via the following PO Box. I check this once a week and
will reply all mail that comes with an sae.  I will also send details of other
programs available or under development.
