According to Dos manual, a Workbench launched application cannot call the
function Execute(). There are two programs in this drawer that test this.
One of them doesn't give a damn what the manual says and tries anyway, the
other opens a console and writes the handle into the pr_ConsoleTask field
of the Process structure. I am not sure how valid this is as the idea was
pinched from a C object module. I would say that it appears to work on my
machine, but so does the 'I don't give a damn' version:-)
