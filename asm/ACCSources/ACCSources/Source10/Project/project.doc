			A68K Front End Project
			======================

 Well, yet again this report has been typed using ACC.

 Last month I said I would corret the bugs causing the cursor to vanish off
the right hand side of the display. This has been done. Also I have stopped
the printing routine from trashing the right hand window border, though this
does occasionally cause a letter to get 'stuck' in the border.

 As well as correcting the above two bugs I have also added requesters to
prevent the accidental trashing of data when Load or Quit are selected. As
the code has changed quite considerably since it's last appearence on the 
disc I have included it this month.

 If you make any improvements/addittions please send them to me.

 It is almost time to unvail the front end on an unsuspecting public, I intend
to do this before the end of March. The disc will contain everything needed
to get started: ConvertFD, a manual and example source.

 I also intend to keep improving the program ( there are lots of areas that
could be improved, such as my latest annoyance, the screen flash every time
the return key is pressed ).

 If you have anything to contribute towards the PD release disc, please get
it to me as soon as possible. If it is source, make sure it assembles using
ACC first. 

 A copy of the Workdisc is available from me as it stands already. This
contains ACC, ConvertFD, all their source, example source that assembles
using ACC and the start of the documentation on how to use ACC. Send a
disc and sae as per usual. Please put your name on the disc and mark it as
ACC Workdisc. This saves me a lot of time and confusion.

 Have now added Helper ( Raistlin ) to the Workdisc, will fix the bugs in
it later ( ie it tests for the function keys even when it is supposed to be
inactive ).

 Here stands a list of bugs and work still outstanding:

 BUGS
 ----
 1/ The screen flashes when RETURN key pressed.
 2/ The Print Page option prints one line to many.
 3/ The Print File option misses the last line of the program off.
 4/ Moving off a line that has been shifted by pressing a cursor key 
    temporarily corrupts that line.<<<< Fixed M.M 8/3/91
 5/ Save routine is not loaded with the name of a source file loaded from
    disc using the Load option.

 Still To Be Done.
 -----------------
 1/ Write the Search/Replace routines.
 2/ Write the Preferences routine.
 3/ Write the Help routine.
 4/ Expand on the assembly options, allowing the user more freedom in the
    use of A68K, ie selecting other A68K switches, producing Linkable files
    and giving the option of linking other files to the one being assembled
    ( using a parameter list that will be passed to Blink ).
 5/ Block editing routines need to be added.
 6/ Requesters could all be made more presentable.
 7/ Add a disassembler, as soon as a PD symbolic one becomes available.

 Well that should give you something to think about. Until next month then,
