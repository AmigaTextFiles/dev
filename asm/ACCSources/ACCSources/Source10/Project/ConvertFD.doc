			***********
			* WARNING *
			***********
			
 ConvertFD writes files to disc. Should files exsist on the disc in the
target directory, they will be deleted and the content lost forever. If
in any doubt, make a copy of the target disc before running ConvertFD.

 Origin
 ======
 
 ConvertFD came into being because of the copyright laws stopping people
from distributing Include files with PD Assemblers. An assembler without
any include files is a pain in the rear to use and often confuses newcommers
to assembly programming. I say this from experience !

 Function
 ========
 
 ConvertFD reads the .fd files from the Extras disc, supplied with every new
Amiga, converts the files into commented ( sort of ! ) assembler include
files and writes this include file into the include directory on an assembler
workdisc.

 Usage
 =====
 
 Before running ConvertFD, make a copy of your Extras disc and rename it as
 
 Extras
 
this can be achieved by entering the following line in the CLI:

relabel drive xxx name Extras

 where xxx would be df0: or df1: or whatever drive you put the disc in.
 
 ConvertFD can be invoked from the Workbench, by double clicking on its icon,
or from the CLI, by entering convertfd.

 Once invoked, a window will open containing brief instructions and three
gadgets.

 Internal Drive Only
 -------------------
 If you only have the internal disc drive available, I would suggest you
enter the following CLI commands before invoking ConvertFD:

  1/  makedir ram:Include
  
  2/  assign Workdisc: ram:
  
 ConvertFD will now treat the ram disc as the target disc for the include
files. When ConvertFD has finished and its indow closes, use a file utility,
or the CLI, to copy the directory ram:Include onto your assembler workdisc.
This is not essential, but it will save you 36 disc swaps !

 Two or More Drive Systems.
 --------------------------
 You will need your Extras disc and an assembler workdisc. The assembler
workdisc should be named 'Workdisc:'. If this is not the case you have three
options:

 1/ Assign the logical name 'workdisc:' to it from the CLI.
 
 2/ Rename it.
 
 3/ Follow the instructions for internal drive users.
 
 All Users
 ---------
 Once prepared, you can start ConvertFD. The three gadgets offer the
following options:

   Extras 1.2
   ----------
   For users with Amiga Extras 1.2.
   If selected, will ask you to insert your extras disc and proceed to
   produce the required include files.
   
   Extras 1.3
   ----------
   For users with Amiga Extras 1.3.
   If selected, will ask you to insert your extras disc and proceed to
   produce the required include files.
   
   CANCEL
   ------
   To Abort the program.
   
 Once all the .fd files have been converted, the window will close and the
program will finish.

 Bugs !!!
 ========
 
 I don't know of any yet, but would appreciate it if anyone finding one would
report it to me as soon as possible.

 Source
 ======
 
 The source for the program will be supplied to anyone sending a disc and
self addressed, stamped envelope to me.
