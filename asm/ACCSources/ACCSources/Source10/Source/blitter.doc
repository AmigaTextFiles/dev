I sent these pieces of code for the beginners that aint got a clue about the
blitter.

BLITTER1 & BLITTER2 by HEARWIG where written so that I could understand the
blitter so they are well set out. Blitter Map is a bit more complicated but
shows what can be achieved when the blitter is used correctly. My stuff is
a basic blit, & 2 plane blit & a logo which took ages.

The code is all commented so there should be no probs!
