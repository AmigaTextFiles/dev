    Hi there again.

    Well this is my first bit of code for the disk, It`s a pretty simple
little demo but the flash graphics and great soundtrack make is seem more
`professional` than simply bouncing a screen up and down. Unfortunately my
first demo also has to go in the `fix-someones-code` section as well, even
though it `works`. Why? Because sometimes when it starts to scroll the screen
down, it trashes the display, but not always! What basically happens is
that screen loses some colours and a picture of the CLI/Genam2 screen
appears in lo-res, classic signs of the BPL pointers pointing to where they
shouldn`t! Another thing is my interrupt routine. I use the one Mike Cross
gave, back around ACC3, to update the stars and music routine each frame.
It works fine but when you exit and the try to call up, say the assemble
window in Genam2, the Guru pays you a visit! Am I forgetting to reset
something to it`s original setting when it exits?

    Of course, when you assemble this program, it`s going to work perfectly
and you`re going to think `Bugs? What`s he talking about!` but I can assure
you, this routine DOES NOT work correctly. 

    I`ve spent hours trying to debug this (standard practice, eh?) but
still I can`t find the bug! If anybody out there can see what I`m doing
wrong, PLEASE TELL ME!

    Well I`m going to leave this little project for now and start a new
one. It`s half term at the moment so I`ve got a whole week to see how many
bugs I can pack into a program, before sending it to you for debugging!
(Joke!) My next venture will be a blitter scroller (thanks to Mike Cross
again!) and I`m not looking forward to it because I have so far completely
failed to get the blitter to do anything more adventurous than put a single
bitplane on the screen. Maybe It will be completed in time to be on the
same disk as this demo? (But I doubt it!) (Answer - No! 12-02-91)

    Actually the last paragraph has just given my a *great* idea for a
competition! Why not throw some heavily bugged code (deliberately or
otherwise) at the readers and get them to debug it! Or maybe ask for the
best improvement on a basic demo (like mine!), maybe making it smaller,
faster or better. Hope you like these ideas! (I need the disks!!!)

				Bye for now,

					Neil.

P.s. The fonts used in this demo were not by me, but borrowed from some PD
     disks I found. I sent them (and a load of others) to Mark (in IFF 
     format) along with this letter, but I don`t know if he has included 
     them. Why not have a look on the disk?

P.P.s If my competition idea didn`t win the disks, how about a design-a-logo
      for an ACC demo (maybe a birthday demo, to celebrate it`s first year?)
