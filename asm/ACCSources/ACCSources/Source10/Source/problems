Hello again Mark!

    At the moment I feel like breaking down in tears! (Almost!) Why? Well
my altered version of Mike Cross`s scroller, JUST WON`T WORK OFF FLOPPY!
Let me explain:

    When you assemble it to memory in Devpac, it works fine. When you
assemble it to (Hard) disk and run it, it works fine. But when assembled to
floppy, I JUST CAN`T GET THE LITTLE B*****D TO WORK!!!!! Sorry. It`s just
I`m pretty frustrated at the moment! I`ve copied the hard disk version onto
the floppy, and it doesn`t work. I`ve copied the floppy version onto the
hard disk and it does work!!!!! I am not rebooting the machine in between
each run (I`m loading dh0:scroller and then df0:scroller), In the immortal
word`s of Garfield: `WHY ME?`

    I`ve just copied the floppy version to ram disk, and it works! I have
also copied it to a completely different floppy, and it doesn`t work!!!

    It`s Sod`s law, isn`t it? The one time you want it to work, it won`t!!!

    I just can`t get ANY of my code to work right! I sort of makes you wish
you`d taken up something simple like flower arranging for a hobby, doesn`t
it?

                        With the usual plea for help,
					Neil.

P.S.	I`ve just found a way for you to see this demo:

	just jit the right mousebutton on the selector screen, and quit the
	selector. Now type (into the CLI) 

	`copy scroller ram:`
	`ram:scroller`
	`delete ram:scroller`

	It works, but it`s hardly a good way of going about it. Any ideas
	what the problem is?
