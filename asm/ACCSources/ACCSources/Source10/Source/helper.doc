     			HELPER DOCUMENT
		       --------------------

					By Raistlin
 General
---------
I wrote helper so that while I am programing I can quickly check ASCII codes,
the copper set, DMA addresses etc. So it is designed to be run while you are
running DEVPAC. While I am writing this doc helper is running in the
background. The only fault is that it seems to be slowing the system down. to
make this a smaller program give it less processor time (you should be able to
do this with the CLI command Taskpri or some other such program.

For those of you that got ACC 9 (if you didnt buy a copy,get it from 
Amiganuts now,its got some ace stuff on),you may be wondering what happened
to the Glossary,& trouble shooting section. I scraped these sections for two
reasons:-
i)They took up too much memory (Helper is already very big!)
ii)Glossary was not really relevant (not for coding anyway)
However as a consilation I have added a table of DMA registers & installed
the control sequence section. If you want the trouble shooting info check
my refernece doc. (not yet complete).

You will also notice that FKEYs are used. Much better than ie Q, V etc.

If you check the source you will notice that I have commented on Ricks part
of the source, if something is commented wrongly then sos!

 The sections
--------------

ASCII TABLE   -What it says. Not all ASCII is here but the most common is.

GURU HELP   -Documentation to help you find that bug that keeps causing guru.

COPPER ISET -A quick glance guide to the copper instruction set, for hardware
	   level programers.

DOS.LIB     -I included this for those programers that use function offsets
	   (like me) instead of labels. Initialy for HEARWIG! Note I will
	   not be documenting EXEC,INTUITION etc!!

68000 HELPER    -Mark let us all down! What happened to 68000 helper? Anyway
 	      I decided one would be useful (this section by HEARWIG)

ADDRESSING MODES -For those beginners who have not quite gotten to grips
	        with the 68000 addressing modes & experts who forget!!

MEMORY MAP      -simply a table detailing the different sections of memory
	      of the Amiga (i.e. Chip, DMA, reserved etc)

DMA REGISTERS   -This is the bonus one. It lists every single DMA register.
   	       Usefull when looking at code with the register address' used
	       instead of labels etc.

CONTROL SEQUENCES -How to change text colout, write in italic, etc.

QUIT	        -Quits, after writing a little message to CLI (orr!)

 Notes
-------
Pressing the right mouse button scrolls/exits current screen. At first the
LMB was used but that meant you couldnt move the window! Then L&RMB where
used. However this felt to uncomfortble. Finally (at last!!) RMB was used


Dont know if I've mentioned this else where but here are the changes
1. Prints to CLI on exit
2. No DOS error on exit (didnt think there was any harm done though!)
3. FKEYS used!
4. Source cleaned-up (just for you!)
5. Added DMA register table
6. Added Control sequece table
7. Altered greets!!!
8. ermed!!


 Closing notes
---------------
68000 helper was about to be scraped. However Mark asked me to finish it. I
did (3 hours of work!) I hope Mark uses it on ACC10/11.

I would like to be able to scroll the text up/down. Mybe in V1.1?

I would like to make helper V2. Using intution (better presentation) & make
it a hardware specific helper. If anybody thinks this is a good idea tell
me! It would encourage me to write it!!

Helper was written for ACC. Feel free to alter it, add to it & generaly
disect it! 

Finaly thanks to:- Hearwig (Rick Sandiford) for writting the 68000 helper
& addressing modes. Without Rick, Helper would never have got past the
scrap paper (drawing board?). Mark Meany for produciong THE best coding
mag, its the best piece of PD there is! (licenceware, sorry!). Miked Cross,
Your tutorials are brill! I can know scroll (see my scrolly piccy if its
used!), use the blitter (at last!!) & generaly abuse the hardware. The
guy that writes the reference material (oops forgot his name, is it Dave
Edwards?), Nipper (yep I got the idea for helper from Squidkick, hope you
dont mind.). And finally everyone that contributes to this utterly brill
disk mag!!!

(With regards to Leon's comment about this LICENCED disk,see readme file),Ray.


	HOPE I'VE NOT FORGOTTEN OWT. YES I HAVE!!

Thanks AMIGA for being THE BEST!!
