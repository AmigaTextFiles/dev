 Hi Mark...
		It's me again,with what must be a worlds first !!!
 no blitter questions at all.
	Well this month I've got 4 bits of code for you 
 (which of course use the BLITTER).Goes without saying really !
	The first is something i saw while watching a demo running
 on a P.C in Dixons or somewhere like that,i can't quite remember.
 It gave the effect of the background being poured in from the top of
 the screen,which i thought looked quite good.So I went home and coded
 one.
	The second one is a variation of the first it basically does
 the same except when the background has finished it pours a bob
 into the display .(performing my fist ever cookie-cut).

	Well this one follows hot on the heels of your interleaved
 blitting tutorial,and is also based on the P.C demo.It blits a graphic
 into the display in two stages.One blits the even lines from the top
 and the other blits the odd lines from the bottom display
 (interleaved in more ways than one !!!)

	And lastly a simple animation using bobs and a frame sequence
 set up in a table,which simply displays the individual frames
 in the right sequence,until the left mouse button is pressed.
	
	
		Enjoy your holiday.........bye for now
