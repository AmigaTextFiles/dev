 Copyright on the source code is retained by the author, and it is requested
 that the original executable file be distributed intact and not amended or
 altered, with the exception of the workbench 2.0 colour configuration.
 
 
 
 The source code is fully documented, I have included all neccessary files
 (except normal includes) to assemble this program from scratch. Those
 programmers who do not use Devpac (which I cannot reccomend highly enough)
 may possibly need to use equates or sets where the RS commands are used. 
 Also some assemblers do not accept Devpacs INCBIN command to insert binary
 files.
 
 
 
 
 Possibly of use to programmers who wish to alter the colour configuration is
 a small resident (348 bytes) cli only utility on this disk called WB2, All
 WB2 does is change the 1.3 prefs pallette to 2.0 colours, and if called
 again reverts back to the system-configuration,toggling between the two
 combinations. I personally find it usefull to establish the effects of 
 reverted black and whites.
 
 
 
 As requested on the program docs, I would appreciate any bug reports or
 suggestions, all communications to the address shown below.
