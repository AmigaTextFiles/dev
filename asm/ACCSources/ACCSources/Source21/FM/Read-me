Please Read the following Docs for the series on Bob Source,BE

Note
*****
As Much memory as possible has been allocated from the free pool
On a few occasions there is a glitch (Any idea's please)
On The Blitcleared source there are 400 Bobs 
				    ***
Just change the global variables at the start of the code to make
the screen a different size or the bob different(remember to save
new Bob data)or the number of Bobs,or the speed of the x,y
increments
 
I have had 2000 Bobs moving around but things get a little slow to
say the least.

All Blitting is interleaved in 3 planes for added speed
All routines have NOT been Optimised for ease of those intrested 
in studying the code
I can supply an optimised routine for those who don't want to
understand it 

Here's a few pointers

Interleaved Blitting
*********************

Remember to save Bitmap and Bob data as Raw Blit(INTERLEAVED)

A quick recap on interleaved planes

Plane1:Word1-word40,Plane2:Word1-word40,Plane3:Word1-word40
Plane1:Word41-word80,Plane2:Word41-word80,Plane3:Word41-word80
....and so on
Plane1:Word(n-40)-word(n),Plane2:Word(n-40)-word(n),Plane3:Word(n-40)-word(n)

Modula = Width*(Depth-1) 
e.g 3 planes Standard 256*40 screensize

Modula = 40*(3-1) = 80


Interleaved Blit
***************
One Bob Interleaved Blitted onto an Interleaved background
Channels used :
	A=mask
	B=BobGraphics
	C=Background Graphics
	D=Designation Address
where C and D = Same Address As the Minterum $CA is used
This will continue to be the case for all the examples that or the
Bob to the background

Interleaved Bobs-Change direction
*********************************
Order of play is:

1) BlitClear the screen area
2) Bobs Or'd with background
back to 1)
each bob has its own x,y and its own velocity
when it hits the edge of the screen it changes direction


SinBobs-BlitCleared
*******************
Order of Play is:

1)Double Buffer
2)BlitClear 
3)Swap Sine Pointers so Xa(Current) becomes Xb(Previous or Last),Same for Y
4)Calculate Position reletive to sine wave
5)Calculate Screen address and shift value
6)Plot Bobs to screen

Sin-Bobs-Blank
**************

1)Double Buffer
2)Calculate previous position and erase it with 0's
3)Swap Sine Pointers so Xa(Current) becomes Xb(Previous or Last),Same for Y
4)Calculate Position reletive to sine wave
5)Calculate Screen address and shift value
6)Plot Bobs to screen

Sin-Bobs-NoDoubleBuffer
**********************

A routine to demonstrate saving and repalcing the background without 
Double Buffering the screen.
Made it easier for me to see what was going on

Save the background into a buffer before the VBL gap otherwise you'll
repalce the wrong data on the screen
Order is

VBL
1)Calculate last position
2)Replace Background
3)Sine Calculation
4)Calcualte Bob position
5)Save background area
6)Plot Bob
MOUSE TEST

Sin-Bob-3
*********

The backgrounds are made of $ff00ff00
As Above Only Double Buffered.Therefor More Bobs
You need to save the background from screen1 and screen2 before
plotting the first bob
Also you need a current list of x,y's
last position x,y's
last-1 position x,y's
because of the double buffering(HAVE A THINK ABOUT IT)
When replacing a background you're working on the Workscreen which is
running 1 loop behind the current screen due to the double buffering 


VBL
1)Double Buffer screen and saved background Buffers
2)Calculate last position
3)Replace Background
4)Swap Last x,y tables
5)Sine Calculation
6)Calcualte Bob position
7)Save background area
8)Plot Bob

As above except I've used a bitmap I had handy
