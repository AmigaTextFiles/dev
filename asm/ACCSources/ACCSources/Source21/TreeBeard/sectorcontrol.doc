Sector Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Decided to have a go at messing around with the trackdisk device, and found
it was quite easy to use.  So I decided to make it into a utility which write
a file to any sector of the disk.  (Apologies to Mark since the front end
looks remarkably like ArpDecrunch!)

It will load a program which has been assembled to disk using the ORG 
directive (which tells the assembler to assemble the code at a set
address - if using trackdisk device to load a program, it usually means
you've trashed DOS and so you can load it at the same address each time).
It will also load a binary file.

The sector number is given by the following formula:

(Track * 22)+(Surface * 11)+Sector

Sector   = 0-10
Surface	= 0 or 1
Track    = 0-79

With all that over, HELP!  The write function doesn't always work properly - 
sometimes it works fine, but sometimes it doesn't write anything, but still
doesn't return an error, and sometimes it misses a few bytes.  It does load
it properly, so presumably its the write routine.  Anyone who can spot the 
error, please write in.
