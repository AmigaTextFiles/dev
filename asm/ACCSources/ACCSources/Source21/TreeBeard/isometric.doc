ISOMETRIC 3-D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Bought the Zero mag, and was impressed with the Populous II demo (how long
will it be before THAT's cracked?).  And I thought that a flat 3D landscape
in the same vein as Populous shouldn't be too difficult.  This is the result.
It hasn't been polished up since it is only intended to be part of a later
project (it flickers since the whole screen is cleared instead of just the
part which the landscape covers, and also it is in 32 colours, though less
than 16 are used - will add more blocks (needing more colours) later.

What are the advantages of this type of 3D?  Well, it looks pretty
impressive (so you can get away with pretty naf graphics - as you'll
see when you run it), and is the easiest type of 3D to do.  Its really
just an extension of the good old tile screens.

THE WAY IT WORKS

The blocks: In this demo, the bases are 32 pixels wide by 15 down.  The
	blocks can be as high as you like (within reason).  They are joined
	together directly, ie. each block isn't presumed to be a certain size

The map: You also need a map, laid out in the following way:

	MAP ---	1 1 0 0 0 1 1
		1 1 0 0 0 0 1
		1 1 0 0 0 1 1
		1 0 0 0 0 1 1
		1 0 0 0 0 1 1
		1 0 0 0 0 1 1

	The 3D is just the map tilted at 45° to the right

	3D ---		1
		      1   1
		    1   1   0
		  1   1   0   0
		1   0   0   0   0
	      1   0   0   0   0   1
		0   0   0   0   0
		  0   0   0   1
		    0   0   1
		      0   1
			1

	Going horizontally, the number added to the current map pointer
	is the Map's width -1.  In the top half, the start of the line
	is on the left edge, in the bottom half it's on the bottom edge
	So that's how you work out which block you're supposed to display

Displaying the Block: The width of the block is 32, the height is 15
	Since the blocks have got to mesh neatly together, in the top
	half, you need to move down 8 (15/2) lines and left 16 pixels
	(32/2) to get to the next line.  In the bottom half, move 8
	pixels down and 16 right.

	To display the block
	1. Create the mask for the block you want to display
	   - see Raistlin's Mask Maker on ACC15 (I think)
	2. Since the blocks can be any height, the position on the
	   screen must sometimes be modified:
		eg. a totally flat block (soil, water, etc.) has
		    a height of 15.  A block with a stick jutting out
		    of it might have a height of 20.  If this is displayed
		    at the same place as the soil would be, it would be too
		    low - it should be displayed 5 (20-15) lines higher.
	3. Display it using cookie cut routines

P.S. WHAT IS THE CORRECT VERTICAL BLANKING ROUTINE?
