Well I've been getting into 3D this month.  The Code I've sent is as follows:-

1. FAST LINE DRAW SOURCE
Well this is my best attempt at a fast line draw routine.  It basicaly draws
a line to the screen.


2. CIRCLE
Interesting routine this.  What it does is to take advantage of the formula,
	
	X1 = X.cos(0) - Y.sin(0)
	Y1 = Y.cos(0) + X.sin(0)

which is used to rotate a point in circular motion.  So what we do is to draw 
a line at 0 degrees & then go through to 360.  This produces a solid (almost)
circle.


3. ROTATED 3D SQUARE
This routine draws a square to the screen & then uses a rotation formulae to
rotate the square around the XYZ axis.


4. ROTATED 3D CUBE
A true 3D rotation.  This routine is the same as the No 3 except that it 
rotates a cube around the XYZ cords.  All thats left now is to fill it!


5. ROTATED SOLID 3D SQUARE
This is exactly the same as No3 except that the square is filled before
being blitted to the screen.  The time needed to fill the square (alot!)
means that the screen needs double buffering to avoid flicker.


6. MOUSEBOBS
This proggy keeps track of the mousemovements & moves a number of bobs
in snake like movement after the mouse.
