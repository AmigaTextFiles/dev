		Generating acc.library
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 If you have read the Project Document on this disc you will already know
that I am using LibTool to assist in the creation of acc.library. Below are
the steps involved :

	1/ Write the source for all routines in library.
	2/ Write an suitable .fd file to go with library source.
	3/ Assemble library source to produce an object file of the
	   functions.
	4/ Run LibTool to generate the library startup source and include
	   file.
	5/ Assemble the startup source to produce a second object file.
	6/ Link the two object files together along with small.lib ( this
	   linker library is a smaller version of amiga.lib produced, I
	   think, by Matt Dillon ). This produces the actual library.
	7/ Edit the include file so it contains any required constants and
	   macros.
	8/ Test the library.
	9/ If a bug is found, edit library source and go back to step 3.
       10/ If there is a new routine to add, add it and go back to step 2.
       11/ Be happy! 

 Well I soon got fed up repeating the above, so I threw a script file
together that preforms all the above tasks. It calls Genim2, LibTool, Blink
and a custom program I've written called MakeInclude. The end result is a
library called acc.library and a complete include file, all from one
command at the CLI.

 The whole project and the tools to produce it decrunch to a disc of their
own. This was done to allow you to experiment, so please do. The script
file has been set up to run from this disc.

 If you add a routine to the lib.s source file, you should follow these
steps:

	1/ Make sure to add the name of your routine to the end of the XDEF
	   list in lib.s
 	2/ Put an entry for your routine in the .fd file.
	3/ Execute the script file from the CLI.
	4/ Write, assemble and test a program that uses your function.

 To create acc.library from the disc you are left with after decrunching,
enter the following at the CLI:

execute df1:make.exe

				All the rest is done for you!

 The documentation for LibTool is included on this disc. Read it for more
insight on the workings of this great util.
