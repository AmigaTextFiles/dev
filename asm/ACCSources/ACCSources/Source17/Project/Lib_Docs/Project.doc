		Project:	The ACC Library
		~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 I've been racking my brains out trying to come up with a programming
project that any reader of ACC can participate in. The biggest problem lies
in diffirent programming techniques and approaches.

 Well, I think I have found the answer. Lets put together a custom library!
The idea came to me while browsing Fred Fish Disc 463, kindly sent to me by
Steve Marshall. The discs contains a great utility called LibTool, designed
to take most of the hard work out of constructing a run-time library.

 The library will contain any useful subroutines sent to me that obey a few
simple rules which I will cover shortly. I don't care what function the
routines have, just as long as they are useful and can be used to speed up
program development.

 To start the ball rolling, I have created the first version of the
library. It only contains a few functions at present, but the example
program shows how much it simplifies a program. At this stage there is only
support for assembly language programmers, but I will update the .fd file
so that all languages are supported ( Yes! using LibTool, the acc.library
can be accessed from Amiga Basic. The implications are mind blowing ----
complete hardware control from a BASIC program arrrrggggh ).

 The doc file that will accompany the library will contain the names of all
people who bother to get involved. 

 The library will never gain world recognition in the same way as ARP, but
it could prove useful to readers of ACC.

 The Rules
 ~~~~~~~~~
 1/ Your subroutine must not corrupt the registers d2-d7/a2-a6. Use movem.l
    to preserve and restore any of these registers you use in your code.

Start		movem.l		d2-d7/a2-a6,-(sp)	save registers

		<< Your Subroutine >>

End		movem.l		(sp)+,d2-d7/a2-a6	restore registers
		rts

 2/ Variables must not be stored in absolute memory locations declared at
    the time of assembly. For example, the following code is not permitted:

		move.l		d0,sum

		<< More Code >>

sum		dc.l		0

 3/ Your library can call functions from the following libraries without
    having to open the library:

		Exec, DOS, Intuition and Graphics.

    The acc.library opens these libraries when it is first opened. The base
    pointers are stored in memory with the labels

		$4.w, _DOSBase, _IntuitionBase and _GfxBase.  

 4/ The subroutine is all your own work!

 That's it, so get writing.

 I have put the source for acc.library on this disc. Do not worry about the
XREF and XDEF declerations. If you are unfarmiliar with importing/exporting
variables from linkable sources, just send me a working example of your
routine, I will make the required alterations.

 Ideas
 ~~~~~
 I intend to incorporate Steve Marshalls ILBM loader and the exec_support.i
file sent to me by Dave Edwards.

 If you are a relative beginner to assembly language, why not try writing
conversion routines for ASCII to long word values and back again. This
could be written as several individual routines or as a couple of
intellegent routines ( ie if the ASCII string starts with % the digits
following are in binary, if a # it's hex and if no qualifier it's decimal
).

 For any willing old hands, how about a simple file requester ( ho, ho ! ).

 I look forward to receiving thousands of useful routines in the very near
future!

 PS. If anyone is interested in starting a library project dealing with a
particular aspect of programming then get in touch. For example, how about
a hardware programmers library ???
