                UpdateCat documentation
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 UpdateCat is a simple utility for  creating  and updating a catalogue of your
entire floppy disc collection. This  catalogue  is  used by WhereIs, and could
conceivably be examined  by  other  applications  as  well.  (Future EarthSoft
products will almost certainly make use of it).

 UpdateCat is written in ARexx, so  you  cannot  run  it unless you have ARexx
installed on your system. If you use  Workbench  2.0  or greater then you have
ARexx already, otherwise you'll have to buy it!

 To install UpdateCat onto another disc,  you should copy the files UpdateCat,
UpdateCat.info and  UpdateCat.rexx  into  the  directory of your choice. Shell
users note that UpdateCat.rexx is essential - the other two are only there for
the benefit of Workbench users.  If  you  are  planning  on redistributing the
program then you MUST also  copy  across  the  file  UpdateCat.doc (wot you're
reading now). If you have a global  REXX:  directory then UpdateCat.rexx could
go there instead.

 To run UpdateCat, boot from your  Workbench  2.0  disc, or any disc which has
ARexx installed, then  just  double-click  on  the UpdateCat icon. You'll also
need to have IconX in your C: directory.

 1) HOW TO CREATE A NEW (EMPTY) CATALOGUE
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Floppy disc users:
        Simply format a disc and relabel it "Catalogue"

 Hard disc users:
        Create a directory called Catalogue ANYWHERE on the hard disc,
        then add the following line to your user startup sequence:

        Assign Catalogue: <full_pathname_of_catalogue_directory>

 2) HOW TO CATALOGUE ONE OR MORE FLOPPY DISCS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Simply  double-click  on  the  UpdateCat  icon,  or,  from  a  Shell type the
following:

        RX UpdateCat

 then follow instructions.

 Note that the name you give for each disc  doesn't have to be the volume name
of the disc. For instance, if you have a  load of discs all called "Empty" but
with different writing on the labels,  then  you can refer to each disc by its
own personal name. When  UpdateCat  prompts  you,  you are given the option of
either using the volume name [just press  enter], or using an alternative name
of your choice [type name then press enter].

 3) HOW TO DELETE A DISK FROM THE CATALOGUE
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 To delete a disc from the catalogue, just type, from a Shell:

        Delete Catalogue:<disc_name>

 or, if you are a Workbench 2 user, you can  open the catalogue drawer, select
Show>All Files from the Window menu,  select  the disc and either drag it into
the trashcan or select Delete... from the Icon menu.
