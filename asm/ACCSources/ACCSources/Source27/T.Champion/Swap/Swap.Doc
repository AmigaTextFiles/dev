                        Swap v1.0 (c) 1992, Tom Champion
                        --------------------------------

    I used a program on (Fish 412) that swapped file names over, it was over
    5k in size and it couldn't swap file names between devices.

    Swap will change file names between devices, Swap is also under 2k
    in size.

Note:
    Use Swap at your own risk.

Usage:

    Swap [First file]  [Second file]

    Example
        Swap file1 file2
        Swap ram:file1 dh0:file2
        Swap file1 docs/file2
