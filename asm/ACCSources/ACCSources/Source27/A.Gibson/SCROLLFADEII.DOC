                        SCROLL FADE II
                        ---------------

        The second scroll and fade  routine  scrolls  the  2 bit planes of the
picture separately. To do this,you  only  have  to make a small adjustments as
the calculations and offsets are already  set up. First lets take another look
at how the scroll works.

        This is for the basic scroll downwards.

        D0=counter for line numbers to show.
        d0 * 40 = number of BYTES to move, it is also used how far from the
        bottom of the picture plane the copy is to start i.e


        5 lines are to be drawn  D0=5   This = 200 bytes at 40 bytes per line

        The picture displayed always starts at the start of the Bit Plane
        
        The source address of the copy on the picture bit plane is D0*40 
        bytes away from the end of the picture plane

        Therefore, if the copy always starts at the to of the display and 
        start 'n' bytes away from the end of the first picture bit plane and
        'n' bytes are copied then the bottom 5 lines of the picture is copied
        onto the top of the display bit plane

        To copy the second bit plane, we take the picture address pointer and
        the screen bit plane pointer and add on #10240 decimal so that there
        is an offset of 10240 bytes which is the size of a whole bit plane
        and the pointers now point to the second screen bit plane and the 
        second picture bit plane.

        I used a3 and a4 registers to point to the second planes and a0 and
        a1 pointed to the first bit planes since I could then copy both 
        planes is one loop speeding thing up.

        In the second scroll routine, I worked out the offsets for the first
        bitplane and then used them to calculate the second bit plane 
        addresses. For the second bit plane,the copy does not start at the top
        of the display. The copy starts at 'n' bytes away from the end of the
        second bitplane which was calculated the same way as the picture 
        source address for the first bit plane. 'n' is the number of bytes to
        copy and = D0 * 40. The picture source address is always the start
        of the SECOND picture bit plane.

        This all sounds confusing and weird, but just look at the code and
        try to figure things out for yourself. I always think you need a good
        imagination for coding to visualize these thing happening!

        Here is my top tips for setting the environment for coding.

        1/ DON'T clean your bedroom.
        2/ Hours before you start to code stick a pile of drinks in the
           fridge.
        3/ Close your curtains unless it's cloudy and definitely not if it is
           Thunder and lightening!!
        4/ Stick a record on. Depending what you like but I consider DIO an
           excellent choice for coding. (MOOODY!)
        5/ Ring your girlfriend so your are not thinking about it all day and
           so she doesn't ring you.
        6/ Light some incense oil or sticks.
        7/ Say a quick prayer to your earth mother (free masons only)
        8/ Check nothing is hiding in the cupboards (for piece of mind!)
        9/ Have lunch so you do not have to break off for it!
       10/ Pay homage to the Amiga to ask for a safe journey whilst coding
           the Amiga.

       11/ Now and only now are you able to go and get a drink,turn on the
            Amiga and begin to code.


        By the way,go and get a copy of the Amiga  Hardware Reference Guide by
Addison and Wesley, it is amazing and essential.

        Also by the way,the fade routine for the second program is the same
        as the first program's fade routine.
        
        Right that's about it for this program. I hope you find the docs and
        code comments helpfull. If you dont or can't understand them then 
        write to me or just write to me for any reason. My address is on the
        other DOC and if you include an S.A.E I'll certainly reply.

        BYE BYE for now......
