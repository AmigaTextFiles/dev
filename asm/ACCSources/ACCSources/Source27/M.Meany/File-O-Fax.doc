Disclaimer 
~~~~~~~~~~ 
 I accept no responsibility for  the  performance  of  this  program or any 
circumstances that may arise due to it. 
 
Function 
~~~~~~~~ 
 I needed a small program in my  startup-sequence  that  would remind me of 
any appointments I had made. This utility  is the result. It will look at a 
data file and display any comments attached to the date in question. 
 
Requirements 
~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 An Amiga 500 or above, in good working order!
 
Usage 
~~~~~ 
 Only ever call from the CLI.  The  filename  can  be  followed with a date 
string if you want details  of  appointments  relating  to a day other than 
'today'. If no date string is supplied, the program will use todays date. 
 
eg1.   file-o-fax 
 
 This will produce a list of all comments  relating to today. This is how I 
call the program from my startup-sequence so I can see what I'm supposed to 
be doing. 
 
eg2.   file-o-fax 05-may-1992 
 
 This will list all appointments for the 5th of may 1992.
 
Data File 
~~~~~~~~~ 
 File-O-Fax relies on a text file for  it's  information. This file must be 
called 'Fax' and should be located in either the 's' directory of your boot 
disk or in the current directory. Use any text editor to create this file. 
 
 Each entry in the file is one line  of  text. This line of text MUST start 
with the date. You can follow  the  date  with  whatever you wish. The date 
must be in the following format: 
 
   dd-mmm-yyyy 
 
 egs   15-may-1992, 01-jan-1993, 07-MAY-1992 
 
 The leading zero is important for  the  first nine days of the month. Also 
the case of the month can be upper or lower, the program is impartial. 
 
 Lines of text not starting with a date will be ignored. 
 
Future 
~~~~~~ 
 This is just the start. I intend to  add  more  features to the program in 
the very near future such as: 
 
   - Display the day of the week. Useful when querying dates in the future. 
   - Optional deletion of comments once displayed to save having to use a 
     text editor. 
   - Update parameter to delete all old comments based on current date. 
   - 'Hot-Key' activation. The program will sit in the background incase 
     you want to make an entry. 
   - In-built facility to allow comments to be added to data file. 
   - Audible prompt when time approaches that specified in comment. 
 
 If I get all these changes working, the program will merit a place in many 
a hard disk startup-sequence. 
 
Lastly 
~~~~~~ 
 This program is Greet Ware. If you  like  it or want to know more about an 
updated version, send me a postcard:

   United Kingdom. 
 
 This is not my address, but a SAFE one that should be fairly future proof!
