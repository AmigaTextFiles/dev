			Compiling ACC Menu
			~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Object Files
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Four object files are required, three of these are the result of assembling
the stand alone assembler modules: text.o, view.o and play.o. The other
object file, data.o, contains the image data for the window. The following
steps are required to produce data.o:

	1. Design the image ( 640x256x2 ) using Deluxe Paint.
	2. Convert the IFF file to a bitmap file, no palette data.
	3. Use data2obj to convert the bitmap file into the required object
	   file. Assuming the bitmap file is called data.bm, this can be
	   achieved using the following:

	   data2obj -c _gfxData data.bm data.o
		     |    |        |      |
		     |    |        |      name of object file
		     |    |        |
		     |    |        name of raw data file
		     |    |
		     |    label at which data should appear
		     |
		     data must be in CHIP memory


 2. C source files
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 There are two source files:

 menu.c		compile this one. It contains all the program code.
 menu_window.h	this file contains all the Window, Gadget, Image and IText
		structure defenitions used by the program.

 Compile menu.c with the following cli command:

lc menu.c

 Easy or what!

 3. Linking it all together.
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The program must be linked with c.o, all the other object files, amiga.lib
and reqtoolsnb.lib. This can be achieved by copying all the object files
into the same directory, CD'ing to that directory and calling blink with
the following batch file:

		*****
FROM lib:c.o
menu.o
data.o
text.o
view.o
play.o
TO Menu
LIB lib:lc.lib
lib:amiga.lib
lib:reqtoolsnb.lib
ND
BATCH
		*****

 Every effort has been made to ensure the source files compile without
errors or warning. I use Lattice 5.02, if you use a different version and
errors/warnings are generated by either lc or blink first check the
following:

 1.	All the header files are available and in the correct directory. If
	you do not have the reqtools package I can supply it!

 2.	Both source files are in the same directory.

 3.	The linker libraries are all in the assigned LIB: directory.

 4.	All object files are in the directories specified in the 'make'
	file passed to blink.

 5.	You have not invoked LC with the -L option.

 If you cannot find the cause of the error/warning, please write and tell
me. Detail the error message as best as you can, identify the area of code.

 Have fun.

	Mark.
