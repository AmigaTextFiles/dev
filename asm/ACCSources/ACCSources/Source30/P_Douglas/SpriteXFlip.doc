		Sprite-X-Flip Subroutine Doc
		   by Paul Douglas, 1992

In this text I've used word Sprite to mean any graphics image, be it
used in sprite hardware, blitter or whatever display format.
This is a small subroutine I developed for use in a game with lots
of graphics. This allows you to just store the frames for any
graphic character ( hardware sprite or bob) in just one direction.
This saves you half the memory of storing frames for both left
and right directions. 

For example if you store all your frames pointing left, then to
get the frame pointing right just call this nifty little subroutine.

Once you've flipped the image you can then use the blitter or the Sprite 
hardware to whack it onto the screen! Obviously flipping your frames
will take longer than storing all left and right frames but you do save
half the memory, as long as you dont mind the left and right frames
being exact mirror images of each other. If you need every extra
microsecond of speed, you could just store one direction of frames
on disk and then flip them all before you start the game going.

You'll need a small amount of free memory into which the flipped
frame will be stored, of the same size as the original frame.
I've assumed all Bobs/sprites are stored as a multiple of words
(ie 16 pixels) wide, which is the usual practice. Also assumed
is that each image is stored in a contiguous lump of memory. It
doesn't matter if you store the mask before or after the normal
bitplanes.


How to use  Sprite_X_flip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  point A0 to the original image you want flipped
  point A1 to the buffer where you want the flipped image

  load D0 with the width of the image in Words

  load D1 with the height of the image, in pixels, multiplied by the 
    number of bitplanes used for the image (including mask bitplane)

  then call Sprite_X_Flip

Eg1  Want to flip a Bob 32 pixels wide by 32 pixels high
     in 32 colours with a mask

therefore load A0 and A1 as appropriate

load D0 with 2  (because image is 2 words wide!)
load D1 with 192 (that is 32 {pixels high} multiplied by 6 {number
                  of bitplanes including mask ie 5+1 in this case})


Eg2  Want to flip a background tile of 16 pixels by 16 pixels
     in 16 colors with no mask

load A0 and A1 appropriately
load D0 with 1 (image is one word wide)
load D1 with 64 (that is 16 {pixels high} multiplied by 4 {number
		 of bitplanes used})


The subroutine is fairly easy to understand and is documented.
Feel free to use, abuse or alter to your own needs.
