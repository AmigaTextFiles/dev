 Helper
 ~~~~~~
 Time to reminese. I remember a time, not so long ago, when I was forever
having to refer to the book '68OOO Assembly Language Programming' published
by McGraw-Hill to get the majority of my programs to work.

 Because of the effort involved in locating first the book, the the relevant
section and finaly the topic I was interested in I decided to write a Helper
program. The intention was to allow quick access to information on 68OOO
instructions.

 My futile attempt was vastly improved on by Steve Marshall. I trashed my
own version for Steves and must admit that for some time I had this program
running while programming.

 Well, as most philosophers will tell you, history repeats itself. In the
case of Helper, someone else saw the need for a program that would give
information on the 68OOO instruction set. Treebeard ( Rick, just for you
Mike!!! ), in the true programmers vain, resurected the idea and developed
his own version. The end result was the same, but the approach was his own.

 Almost two years on, I found myself in need of a similar program. The 68OOO
instruction set and I are old friends now ( excepting PC relative code and
the use of stack frames ). However the same cannot be said of the system's
libraries. I know what a majority of the routines can do, but I can never
remember entry requirements - ie. what value in which register. Yet again I
find myself constantly refering to manuals, a time consuming task I could
do without. Enter LibHelp, a utility to display entry parameters for most
system library routines.

 My version of this program was very basic, intended to meed my demands
rather than those of a third party. Dave Edwards saw the need for a more
versatile version of this program and released a program that read it's
data from disk. This allowed easy updating/alteration of the data displayed
by the program.

 Not being content with either 68OOO Helper or LibHelp, I decided to write
a program to display information on system structures. How many times have
you stared at the monitor and tried to guess the offset label and size of
the Image structures UserData field. Time for another util!

 Being the fool I am, I wrote one. Only after completing the program did I
realise that a general purpose version that could load data on ANY subject
would be more useful.

 That is what this utility is all about! Run it from the CLI, passing the
name of a text file. This file will be loaded and ready for access.

 The program accesses information by locating asterixes in the file, though
you could change this in the source if you so wish! When a match is found for
a string entered by the user, all lines of text to the next asterix are
displayed! Easy or what.

 What I need now are data files to go with the damn thing! If you would be
so kind as to supply a couple, I will update the program in the following
way:

	1/ Add a file requester
	2/ Add some respectable gadget imagery
	3/ Add a find next/previous function
	4/ Add better mouse control
	5/ Possibly a print option!

 At present the only data file available is struct.hlp in this directory.

 Example Address Book File
 -------------------------
 
 *name 1
 line 1 of info
 line 2 of info
 line 3 of info
 line 4 of info
 *name2
 line 1 of info
 *name3
 line 1
 line 2
 line 3
 line 4
 line 5
 
 Get the idea, preceed all reference words with an asterix and the program
will be able to locate the information that follows! Any number of lines can
follow a reference word.
