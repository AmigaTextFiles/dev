 If this program crashes your machine and causes the loss of valuable
documents then I'm sorry! I accept no responsability for the performance of
this program on any Amiga. Use at your own disgression.

 The program has been tested on the following configorations without ill
effects to date:

	A500+, 2 Meg CHIP, 2 Meg FAST, A590 20 Meg.
	A500+, 2 Meg CHIP.
	A500+, 1 Meg CHIP ( standard machine ).
	A500, v1.2, 1/2 Meg CHIP, 1/2 Meg FAST.
	A500, v1.2, 1/2 Meg CHIP ( standard machine ).

 As you can see, I never owned a 1.3 machine!

 General
 ~~~~~~~
 This program was written specifically for the ACM manual. The object was
to enable a tutorial that explained particulars on an aspect of assembly
language programming technique to be viewed, while allowing example source
files to be viewed at the same time.

 The user could be reading a tutorial when a reference to an example
program crops up. So all that is required is to load the example and view
that as well. This not being enough, the user is also given the option of
running the example to see exactly what happens.

 At all times, both the tutorial and current example are displayed.
Switching between the two is as simple as pressing a key or mouse button.

 As I stated above, the program was intended for use with the ACM disks. If
you think you have could use it to present a subject other than programming
then please write to me at the above address. There is no reason why IFF
ILBM files and sample/tracker files cannot be implemented as well. This
opens up the world of learning to Amiga enthusiasts. My address csn be
found at the end of this file.

 Users Point Of View
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 This displayer is capable of displaying two text files at the same time.
No great achievment in this day and age I admit. However, one of the files
is a tutorial that is explaining some aspect of a topic to you. This file
is displayed at the top of the screen under the heading 'Tutorial'.

 The second file is an example that covers a specific subject in more
detail. At the appropriate point in a tutorial, reference will be made to
an example. You just load the example and read through it!

 This displayer is intended for use as a learning tool for programmers. For
this reason, the option of executing an example is also available. So you
can read a tutorial, load examples when required and also see them running.

 Unlike conventional menus/displayers this displayer is controlled by a
config file. This means it has a list of what examples are available and
what order they occur in. Hence, you only need to load the next tutorial,
without worying what it is called, to see it! The program locates the file
for you!

 Only one of the two files loaded can be active at any one time. The active
file is determined by looking at the titles. The tutorial text is headed
with a title that says 'Tutorial', the example file by 'Example'. The active
region has it's title displayed in 'Bold' text, the inactive in 'Italics'.

 Also in the title line you can see your position in the file. In the case
of the example you can also see your position in the example list.

 User Usage
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 Keyboard Options
 ================
 When the displayer is running, certain keys can be used to achieve a
desired effect. These are detailed below. In all cases you can abort a
selection by clicking on either the 'Cancel' gadget or the windows close
gadget.

 Key			Effect

  Q			Will allow you to quit the displayer. A window will
			open asking you to verify this option first.
  L			Load an example: You are presented with the 
			opportunity of loading either the next or previous
			example.
  R			Run current example: If you have an example loaded,
			it will be executed so that you can see the result.
  S			Search for text: You specify what string to search
			for or if you wish to search for the Next/Previous
			occurence of a string already defined. There is a 
			quicker way of searching for Next/Previous occurence
			of a text string, see below!
  P			Print Text: You are given the option of printing the
			current page/file of text.
  B			Jump To Marker: If the author has inserted markers in
			the tutorial or example, this function will move you
			to either the Next or Previous one depending on your
			selection.
 TAB			Switch: Switches between the tutorial and the example
			You can only operate on one text region at a time, 
			this lets you switch between regions. You can tell
			which region is active by looking at the titles, the
			inactive regions title is displayed in italics.
 Cursor Up		Scrolls you towards the start of the active region.
 Shift + Cursor Up	Scrolls you towards the start of the active region
			one page at a time.
 Cursor Down		Scrolls you towards the end of the active region.
 Shift + Cursor Down	Scroll you towards the end of the active region one
			page at a time.
 Cursor Left		Shortcut for Search-Previous.
 Cursor Right		Shortcut for Search-Next. 
 
 Mouse Control
 =============
 Some options can be simulated by using the mouse. This is an Amiga after
all!

Scroll Up:	By positioning the cursor in the top half of the active
		display and pressing the left mouse button, you will cause
		the text to scroll up. Hold the button down to repeat the
		operation.
Scroll Up:	By positioning the cursor in the first line of the active
  Page		display and pressing the left mouse button, you will cause
		the text to scroll up a page. Hold the button down to repeat
		the operation.
Scroll Down:	By positioning the cursor in the bottom half of the active
		display and pressing the left mouse button, you will cause
		the text to scroll up. Hold the button down to repeat the
		operation.
Scroll Down:	By positioning the cursor in the last line of the active
   Page		display and pressing the left mouse button, you will cause
		the text to scroll down a page. Hold the button down to
		repeat the operation.
Switch Region:	By positioning the cursor anywhere in the inactive region
		and pressing the left mouse button, you will make that
		region the active one.

 Compilers Usage
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you have taken it upon yourself to compile a teaching manual, you have
my whole hearted sympathy!

 To use this utility you need the following:

 1/ A tutorial for each subject covered.
 2/ Examples for each subject covered.
 3/ A control file for each tutorial.

 The program only comes into it's own when used with a menu program such as
Nico Francois ProgramSelector or my own Menu. 

 Still, the CLI usage of this program is 'Displayer <control file>'.

 The control file is built up as follows:

Line  1:	Pathname of tutorial file.
Line  2:	Pathname of 1st example file.
Line  3:	Pathname of 2nd example file.
Line  4:	Pathname of 3rd example file.
   "		"	"	"	"
   "		"	"	"	"
Line  n:	Pathname of nth example file.
Line  n+1:	A blank line! (( JUST PRESS RETURN ))

 Executable Examples
 ===================
 If you intend to use executable examples from the displayer, then each
example must have an extension that consists of two character. This
includes the period, if used. The 'Displayer' program forms the name of the
executable from the name of the example by chopping the last two character
off the example name. For example:

ACM:Exec/Eg_1.s			<The example filename>
ACM:Exec/Eg_1			<The example filename formed by 'Displayer'>

 Non Programming Examples
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you are devising a manual that requires either IFF ILBM pics/anims or
IFF 8SXVS sample files, or RAW data files ( samples/bitmaps/modules ) then
write to me with more details. I could be persuaded to customise the
displayer ( non financial! An offer of services/help/etc would be most
welcome ).

 As more people stretch 'Displayer', the better it will get. I have already
written versions that can load IFF ILBM files and NoiseTracker modules, my
usual sidetrack when writing utilities these days!

 Using 'Displayer'
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Anyone can use 'Displayer', the only rule is that you send me a copy of
the production using it. I will not pass this on without your written
permission.
