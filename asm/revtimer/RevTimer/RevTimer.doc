                              RevTimer 1.03                       20-Mar-95
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a little program, that reads the system clock, and saves it in
four environment variables, called Date, VerDate, Day and Time - once a
second (or as often as specified).

The reason why I did this, was that I wanted an easy way to get the date
into my programs.

As the assembler I use can't run arexx/dos scripts, and I keep forgetting
to put the current date into the program, I did this program.

Requires OS2.04 (V37).

Function
~~~~~~~~
RevTimer can be run from both CLI and Workbench.  It should be placed in
the WBStartup drawer.

To start the program, just double-click on its icon or enter the name of
the program from the CLI.

The program can be quitted by double-clicking on its icon when it is
already running or by using the 'Commodities Exchange'.

Use the tooltype 'DONOTWAIT' if you are using the program from the
WBStartup drawer (the tooltype is set by default).

There are also some other tooltypes that can be used to change some defaults
for the program (this can not be done from CLI).

UPDATETIME - If you eg. only want the date to be written once a minute, then
             you can use this.

TIME       - If you don't want the Time to be written, use this.

DATE       - If you don't want the Date to be written, use this.

DAY        - If you don't want the Day to be written, use this.

VERDATE    - If you don't want the VerDate to be written, use this.

Here comes some examples:

1/

UPDATETIME=60   ; Update variables once a minute
TIME=YES        ; Write time
DATE=NO         ; Don't write date
DAY=NO          ; Don't write day
VERDATE=YES     ; Write date in canadian format (used for version strings)

2/

UPDATETIME=10   ; Update every ten seconds.
TIME=NO         ; No time
DATE=YES        ; Use date
DAY=YES         ; Use day
VERDATE=NO      ; No VerDate

Default is:

UPDATETIME=1    ; Write the date once a second
TIME=YES        ; Write the time (eg. 13:49:11)
DATE=YES        ; Write the date (eg. 10-Dec-94)
DAY=YES         ; Write the day (eg. Saturday)
VERDATE=YES     ; Write the date (eg. 10.12.94)


To use the dates in assembler:

DATE:   IncBin  ENV:Date        ; The format is: DD-MMM-YY
VERDATE:IncBin  ENV:VerDate     ; The format is: DD.MM.YY
TIME:   IncBin  ENV:Time        ; The format is: HH:MM:SS
DAY:    IncBin  ENV:Day         ; The full dayname.

Here comes the format for the version string. I copied this from the
document file for the program 'RIVer' by Chris P. Vandierendonck. I hope
he doesn't mind that I copied it...

       EVID (Embedded Version ID) structure
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         The standard format (AmigaDOS) of an EVID structure is as
         follows :

           $VER: <name> <version>.<revision> (<dd>.<mm>.<yy>)

         Field explanation -> <name>     : name of the program or file
                              <version>  : major version number
                              <revision> : minor version number
                              <dd>       : creation day 
                              <mm>       : creation month (numeric)
                              <yy>       : creation year

         After this text sequence, most programs include a comment.

         All my programs support this EVID code,  but  the  structure  has
         been extended. (This has no effect on the correct functioning  of
         the AmigaDOS command 'Version'!).


         The extended format (AmiSYS format) is as follows :
                              
           $VER: <name> <version>.<revision> (<dd>.<mm>.<yy>/
           <hh>:<mm>:<ss>/<devcode>) <comment>

         Field explanation -> <hh>      : hour created
                              <mm>      : minutes of hour created
                              <ss>      : seconds of hour created
                              <devcode> : code  used  in  development   of
                                          program 
                              <comment> : copyright notice
