Changes v1.02 -> v1.03
----------------------
Minor bugfix:
The date format for the VerDate variable changed to the correct one.
Ie. DD.MM.YY (Used to be DD-MM-YY).

This worked on WB2.1, but not on WB3.1, so I thought that I should change
it.

The official format IS: DD.MM.YY , so it was not documented to work.
