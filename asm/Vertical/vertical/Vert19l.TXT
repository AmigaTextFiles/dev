MACHINE:AGA only (uses 64 wide 16colour sprites and own cmap)
CODE:Andyrew
GFX:OJ
LEFT SHIFT EXIT		 

This is a really smart program i wrote a while back.
It started as just a test to see if i could program AGA.
The main ship is 2 64wide sprites.
It uses 2 16 colour dual playfields
and my favourite routine is the bullet and collision routines.

The bullets use the same sprite as the ship! so there is a lot of shuffling
of data.

The collision routine which suprised me is done with interupts.
How can you get the same sprite to detect a collision if its either
1 of many bullets or the player?

See all the colour bars up the screen.
They are ALL interupts. on the 1st irq (decide which object we are checking)
		   2nd irq (read collision register and store)
		   
This simple thing is done for every sprite.

BUGS:NONE except there is not enough level data.
