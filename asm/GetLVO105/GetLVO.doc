*
*   NAME   
*	GetLVO -- Obtain legible LVOs or *.i's from *_lib.fd files. (V1.05)
*
*   TEMPLATE
*	LIB/A,PAT/A
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	GetLVO <libName> <funcName>
*
*   FUNCTION
*	GetLVO first of all attempts to get a path to the *_lib.fd files
*	contained in the environment variable 'GETLVO'. If this fails, it
*       uses its default setting: 'FD:'.
*	Next it scans the libName_lib.fd file and any matches to 'funcName'
*	is sent to stdout in this format:
*
*	        _LVOfuncName EQU -$XXXX ; (parms,...)(regs,...)
*
*	GetLVO might be useful as a quick reference to functions that you
*	only vaguely remember or for creating *.i files ready to use with
*	your assembler (use <GetLVO libName *> for a total list of funct-
*	ions). 
*
*   INPUTS
*	libName  - Name of library without the '.library' extension.
*	funcName - Function or pattern to search for in libName_lib.fd.
*
*   RESULT
*	If all goes well a list of matching functions is sent to stdout
*	and the returncode is set to 0.
*
*	If execution is halted while reading or writing GetLVO returns 1.
*
*	If no matches are found the program returns 5.
*
*	If something else goes wrong, like "Couldn't open file" or "Not
*	enough memory" GetLVO exits with returncode 10 and additional
*	information may be obtained by using the Why command.
*
*   EXAMPLE
*	1> GetLVO exec FreeMem
*	_LVOFreeMem EQU -$00D2 ; (memoryBlock,byteSize)(a1,d0)
*
*	1> GetLVO intuition FakeFunc
*	- No matches found -
*
*	1> GetLVO dos Write*
*	_LVOWrite      EQU -$0030 ; (file,buffer,length)(d1/d2/d3)
*	_LVOWriteChars EQU -$03AE ; (buf,buflen)(d1/d2)
*
*   NOTES
*	Requires dos.library V37+.
*
*	No wildcard matching for the 'libName' entry [yet]. If you want
*	to create *.i files for all of your *_lib.fd's, I suggest that
*	you get hold of my 'Expand' program, which allows wildcards with
*	any program that is run from shell.
*
*       GetLVO is fully re-entrant (PURE) and can be made resident under
*       e.g. WShell or by using the AmigaDOS 2.0 Resident command.
*
*	GetLVO is copyright (C) 1991 SmallCode SoftWare (KAS), but is free-
*	ly redistributable if the following conditions are met:
*
*	    o  GetLVO is 'PostCardWare' - i.e., if you like this program
*	       and use it regularly, you are OBLIGED to send me a post-
*	       card. You'll find my address below.
*
*	    o  This archive should ALWAYS be redistributed in its entire-
*	       ty and original format, holding the following files:
*
*	               GetLVO        - The executable itself 
*	               GetLVO.doc    - What you are now reading
*	               Env/GETLVO    - Sample ENV:GETLVO file
*	               ZZEndPad.FOO  - Someone's still using XModem...
*
*	    o  It should NEVER be included in ANY commercial packages
*	       without PRIOR written consent from the author.
*
*	    o  No monetary gains may be made from the distibution of this
*	       archive.
*
*   BUGS
*	Due to the action of dos.library's ReadArgs(), GetLVO fails in
*	wildcard searching for single-char LVOs (e.g.: GetLVO asl ?) -
*	however, this should be of no inconvenience in 'real life'.

*****************************************************************************
*
*   HISTORY
*	V1.00 - Prototype.
*	V1.01 - Skipped main() - now using _main() instead.
*	V1.02 - Most routines now uses __regargs
*	V1.03 - Now looks for path to *_lib.fd files in $GETLVO.
*	V1.04 - Minor bugs fixed.
*	V1.05 - First public release.
*
*   GREETINGS
*	Sincere thanks go to:
*
*	    Carolyn Scheppner (CATS), whose "LVO" inspired me to write
*	    this program.
*
*	    Adam Sjoegren (FastJack), FidoNet @2:230/149, for á-testing.
