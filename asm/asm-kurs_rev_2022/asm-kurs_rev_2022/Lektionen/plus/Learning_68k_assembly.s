Learning 68k assembly – now or never

Wanna learn assembler? Novel was so blown by RamJam's "Corso di Assembler",
so he discovered a few more opportunities that 2021 has to offer.

Novel was so blown away by the Amiga Compos after the 2019 revision that he
decided – once again – to learn assembler. This time he made it through the
first chapters of RamJam’s "Corso di Assembler" in no time – and discovered
a few more opportunities that 2020 has to offer for future Amiga coders.

A new old trend
The competitions at Revision 2019 and GERP 2020 proved it once again:
The Amiga is still alive and kicking and the Amiga scene is all the more
capable of setting standards in terms of design, concept and storytelling.
But above all, the stories of releases like EON by TBL or Coda by Abyss
show that there are still new tricks and methods to be discovered that can
impress the aging masses all over again.

The A500 has become the central compo platform in recent years.
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

It is notable that the Amiga 500 in particular has developed to become the
central compo platform in recent years. 512 kb chipram, expanded to a maximum
of 1 MB, which was the gaming standard of its time, are supposed to be
sufficient. After many years in which various Amiga configurations stood out
from each other due to AGA, 060s, PowerPC, graphics card or RAM requirements,
the direct comparability between the entries is again given. Some people also
catch themselves thinking about the retro-funfact that today’s production
would have run in the same way in 1987.

Why is the Amiga 500 state of the art again in the Amiga scene? On the one
hand, this could be because it is a clearly defined platform that filled
millions of afternoons in children’s rooms in its standard configuration.
Fortunately, it has never been as easy as it is today to start programming
the Amiga.

When the Amiga and the 68k were standard, there were of course various
resources. Anyone who tried to program on the 68k during Commodore’s lifetime
could learn from books and magazines. The CPU was also quite popular at
universities for computer science studies. However, you have to bear in mind
how uncommon computers were at the time. Adult education courses from the time
were mainly concerned with the introduction to computer operation itself,
specific programming courses on the Amiga mostly only dealt with BASIC.

So if you wanted to become a real democoder, you had to find another way.
Through swappers or dubious magazine advertisements, you got the demos and some
contacts who gave you a first insight. If you actually had access to an
assembler that you could buy in a shop for a lot of money, you had to keep on
changing disks and, thanks to trial and error, laboriously load the workbench
over and over again until the desired address had arrived in the right
register. And if it didn’t work after all, the only way to ask questions was
to reach for the landline phone, hoping that your buddy had more clue.
Fortunately, back then you had time for such things, because you were a
schoolchild enjoying summer holidays and not having to cook dinner, vacuum,
do your tax return or change any nappies.

The Corso di ASM by RamJam

Scicco/Scarab also used the advantage of his still youthful hour. After his
first demo party, the Mekka & Symposium 1999, to which he had been dragged by
Lubber/Pandua, he thought: I want to do something like "Grid", Nature’s
Winner-40k. So he spent the following weeks at his Amiga 2000 greedily working
through Randy/RAMJAM’s assembler course.

RamJam
The course, which was published in Italian in 1994 and put on the Aminet a year
later around Christmas by Martin de Tomaso, contains all the basics that are
necessary for creating oldschool demos. After the obligatory introduction to
the different types of addressing and basic arithmetic with binary and
hexadecimal numbers, the first moving Copperbars are immediately introduced.
Images are being converted, displayed, scrolled, the bitplanes are shifted into
each other, distorted with the modulo and finally backgrounded with Protracker
modules. Furthermore, fonts are displayed and scrolled and you also learn how
to work with sprites.

The second half of the course contains lessons on blitter and more code
optimisation. It was translated from Italian to German and put on Aminet just
in 2019/2020, yet the translation was apparently done by machine in large parts
and still contains systematic errors, at least for the time being. Readers who
are familiar with the Italian language are best off reading the original.

Randy had created this in the early 90s. "I always had the habit of writing
books or tutorials while learning something new," he writes. "I have a very
short memory, and I memorise better when I write summaries or explanations in
my own words." Also, many people around him had an Amiga, but there were hardly
any courses and hence hardly any developers. He was determined to make it
possible for more people to program.

The fact that many people have rediscovered the Amiga and want to learn
programming for it motivated the guys from Ram Jam to get back together and
make the course better accessible again. As of 2016, Corso Di Assembler is
freely downloadable from the Ram Jam website as a 1872-page PDF and can also
be ordered as a printed book.

Ramjam founder Yuki, who responded to Jurassic Pack’s request, remembers:
"Alessandro (Trantor) did have some spare time. Well… at night. He said:
‘Hey, I have some available night timeslots’. He had the idea and asked me and
Fabio: What about making a LaTeX version of the original ascii course, in
order to have a PDF and /or paper printable version of the course in modern
book format? We were both excited about such a production, and immediately
started to write the prefaces, while Alessandro did a huge, incredible job
re-writing the complete book from scratch. The work lasted for several months.
I personally spent a lot of time assembling on A-UAE all the lessons, to make
the screenshots available in the 1872 pages free PDF e-book."

"It’s complex to find a translator who knows assembly, Amiga, Motorola and
 the weird world of the demoscene"
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

An English version is not yet known, but could one day become reality.
 "We did plan to make an English version," Yuki writes, "but the translation is
 really a huge job – 1872 pages of technical, informatic and mathematic
 explanations." They had considered paying for a professional translator, but
 "it’s complex to find a translator who knows assembly, Amiga, Motorola and the
 weird world of the demoscene".

Fabio’s old course is still useful today in order to achieve the goal of
bringing something demoscenic onto the screen reasonably quickly. Copper
effects, bitplanes, displaying IFFs, modulo effects – all this is timeless.
Didactic masterpieces should not be expected, given the fact that it was
16-20 year olds who wrote the course. The LaTeX version ought to stay that
way, too, "since we did want to preserve the original spirit of documentation
written by teenagers." Technically, the course could also do with an update,
as Thrashm One and the old Kefcon are certainly no longer at the cutting
edge. Nevertheless, it remains a clear recommendation for all beginners.

How to continue?
Amiga Assembler Buch

After Scicco had knitted together his first mini-demo based on the course, he
had to find more material from other sources. For Chunky to Planar (C2P), he
was apprenticed to Yormas/Nature and picked up topics like matrix rotation and
vector calculus from a textbook on mathematics. Even PC assembly code from the
Internet at the time helped him, for example to learn 3D routines for texture
mapping. Did that ever get really tough? "It’s all difficult, somehow, but the
things I’ve done in the last few years have been really tricky, the really rad
effects, of which you initially think: that’s not actually possible." 
Everything else, Scicco says, has only ever been new territory. So you just
have to stick with it, then it will work, somehow.

But how should one motivate oneself? Bifat/TEK clearly recommends:
"Visual programming" to me. Don’t spend too much time on theory, but put
something on the screen right away to see that you have achieved something. 
The rest comes by itself. That speaks in favour of the Corso di Assembler,
I guess.

If you can’t get any further on your own, the old tactic of learning the same
content from different sources is recommended, e.g. searching for old books or
magazines. German-speaking Amigans can download Peter Wollschlaeger’s Amiga
Assembler book as a PDF. Also of interest is "The final Assembler Book" 
("Das endliche Assemblerbuch") by Christian Ullenboom, a now successful Java
book author who could not find a publisher for his 68k course back in 1993.
As for English, the extensive tutorials by Photon/Scoopex, which he has
published on YouTube, are particularly worth mentioning. Like the Italian
course, his 43-part "Amiga Hardware Programming" series is oriented towards
beginners in scene coding.

On top of that, innumerable websites, Facebook groups and other sources from
which to get code and advice are available. Who would have thought in the
mid-90s that the Amiga scene would still be so active in 2020? Thanks to
emulators and crossassemblers like vasm, as well as the plug-in capability
of modern IDEs, it should also become increasingly simple for younger
programmers (or at least such programmers who have previously only worked
on the PC) to find their way around the Amiga universe. The Amiga scene is
looking forward to seeing you!
