      New feature: Added -ln option for generation of ascending label numbers

      New feature: Added -a switch to generate comments for offset relative
                   to the start of the file.

      Major mod.: Deleted -ce option
                  I got the impression ADis works just as well without it.
                  Always cluttered up the command line.

      Major mod.: Rewritten part of the hunk handling routines.
                  Overlay files are now handled correctly

      Major mod.: ixemul.library is now obsolete. ADis is linked with
                  a small library implementing the necessary functions

      Minor mod.: Remove temporary files upon exit (even with CTRL-C)

      Bug fix: Upon non-FPU disassembly the first opcodes in the opcode table   
               were marked illegal.

      Bug fix: Register list was misinterpreted for MOVEM / FMOVEM
               instructions.

      Bug fix: DC.B $80 was printed as DC.B -$7F

V1.3: New feature: Added extra 68040 FPU opcodes
