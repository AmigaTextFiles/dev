INTRODUCTION TO RESOURCE
========================
ReSource is an interactive disassembler for Amiga computers.  There are other
Amiga disassemblers, both public domain and commercial.  The following points
characterize ReSource as distinct from other disassemblers:

	1. ReSource is fully interactive.
	2. ReSource was written for the serious user.
	3. ReSource understands the Amiga®.

Because ReSource can get its input from a file, track, or memory, and  output
all or in part to any of these, it is more a general purpose tool than just a
disassembler.  It can be used to browse through files, without ever bothering
to save anything, just to find out what is inside.  It also knows quite a bit
about AmigaDOS(tm) and the Amiga® OS.  This built-in intelligence  will  save
you  a  great  deal  of  time  when  disassembling  files.   ReSource is also
blindingly fast.  It is written entirely in assembly language, and  does  all
text rendering using its own special internal routines.   The  following  are
some of ReSource's features:

	ReSource is easy to work with.  ReSource will amaze you with its
	ease of use and straightforward user  interface.   Unlike  other
	disassemblers,  ReSource is fully interactive, and allows you to
	"do it your way".  There are plenty of  options,  and  decisions
	are not forced on you.

	ReSource is fast and thorough.  ReSource was designed to be used
	by serious software developers.  ReSource is aimed at those that
	need to disassemble large programs into source files  that  will
	reassemble  and  run  correctly.   For a disassembler to achieve
	this, it must  be  able  to  produce  totally  bug-free  output.
	Furthermore, it must be able to produce high-quality output with
	the  minimum of effort from the user.  ReSource achieves both of
	these objectives, albeit at the cost of large memory usage.

	ReSource makes the most of  your  programming  skills.   Because
	ReSource  understands  AmigaDOS(tm)  and  the Amiga® OS, you can
	concentrate on the task at hand, and not expend effort on trying
	to look up or remember details better left to a computer.


GETTING STARTED
===============
This section is designed to get you started with ReSource.  It will guide you
through installing ReSource on either a floppy based Amiga®, or a system with
a hard drive.  It will explain some of the basics of operating ReSource.

System Requirements
ReSource is designed to work on any  properly  configured  Amiga®  500,  600,
1000, 1200, 2000, 2500, 3000, or 4000.

Version 1.3 or higher of the Amiga® OS is required.

One megabyte of RAM is required, and you will need 1 1/2 to  2  megabytes  of
RAM if you want to work with files larger than 30-40K.

Because ReSource uses functions in the "ARP" library, you must have the  file
"arp.library"  in your "LIBS:" directory when you run ReSource.  This file is
available from most BBS's.  The version of "arp.library" must be 34 or higher.

If you will be using ReSource under V1.3 of the Amiga® OS,  we  suggest  that
you  run  FastFonts©  or  Blitzfonts©.  Otherwise, scanning through the menus
will be very sluggish due to the large number of sub-items.

Archive Contents
================
The Official ReSource Demo archive contains the following files:

  ReadMe                       This file
  ReadMe.info                  Icon to view ReadMe
  Start_Resource               Script to do temporary installation and run
  Start_ReSource.info          Icon to run the script
  RSDemo                       The main disassembler, demo version
  RSDemo.info                  Icon to run RSDemo
  libs/ReSourceloader.library  Library required for ReSource
  libs/ReSourcemenus.library   Required for access to menus
  libs/ReSourcesyms.library    Required for access to internal symbol bases
  libs/ReSourcehelp.library    Required for online help facility
  s/RS.keytable                Default keytable
  s/RS.macros                  Example macros

Installation
============
Unpack the archive using the utility of your choice.  Be careful to  preserve
path  information  when  doing so.  You should end up with a list of files as
shown above.   To  do  an  easy  trial  installation,  double  click  on  the
"Start_ReSource" icon.

For a permanent installation, just copy the above files as shown below:

  copy RSDemo                       <anywhere in your path, e.g. 'C:'>
  copy RSDemo.info                  <as above>
  copy libs/ReSourceloader.library  libs:   ;or libs:ReSource/
  copy libs/ReSourcemenus.library   libs:   ;or libs:ReSource/
  copy libs/ReSourcesyms.library    libs:   ;or libs:ReSource/
  copy libs/ReSourcehelp.library    libs:   ;or libs:ReSource/
  copy s/RS.keytable                s:
  copy s/RS.macros                  s:

No assignments need to be made.  Installation is now complete.

Starting ReSource
=================
If you will be starting ReSource from the CLI, at the prompt type:

   1> run RSDemo       ;the word "run" is optional.

   1> RSDemo <ProgName>
   The executable program <ProgName> will be loaded as a load file if it is a
   load file.  Otherwise, it will be loaded as a ".RS" data file  if  it's  a
   data file.  Otherwise, it will be loaded as a binary file.  Corrupted load
   files may have to be loaded as a binary image.

   1> RSDemo *b <FileName>
   The file <FileName> will be loaded as a binary image.

   1> RSDemo *m <Sloc> <Eloc>
   Load memory, from location <Sloc> to location <Eloc>.

   1> RSDemo *DFn: <Scyl> <Ecyl+1>  [#sec]  [Offsec]  Load  from  drive  DFn:
   starting at cylinder <Scyl> and continuing to <Ecyl+1>.  The default is to
   read  complete  track(s).   This  may be modified by the next two optional
   parameters:  The fourth parameter  specifies  that  ReSource  should  read
   [#sec]  extra  sectors, and the fifth parameter specifies that rather than
   begin reading from the  start  of  <Scyl>,  offset  the  start  sector  by
   [Offsec] sectors.

   Using "?" as the first parameter on the  command  line  will  display  the
   parameter syntax requirements, then exit immediately.

   ReSource will accept "-I" or "-i" as the first parameter  on  the  command
   line.  This will force ReSource to use an interlaced screen.  Note that if
   your  Workbench(tm)  screen is in interlace mode, this flag has no effect.

   Conversely, to force ReSource to use a non-interlaced screen, use "-N"  or
   "-n" as the first parameter on the command line.  This will force ReSource
   to use a non-interlaced screen.  Note that if your Workbench(tm) screen is
   not in interlace mode, this flag has no effect.

If you will be starting ReSource from the Workbench(tm), double click on  the
"RSDemo"  program  icon  or  "Start_ReSource"  script  icon.  Then use one of
ReSource's functions to load a file, memory, or disk blocks.

Input and Output
================
ReSource is quite flexible in the way that it allows you  to  load  and  save
files and data.  For example, you may:

   1. Load as an Amiga® executable program
   2. Load as an Amiga® file
   3. Specify an area of memory to disassemble
   4. Load 1 or more sectors/cylinders from a floppy disk
   5. Load a previously saved ".RS" file

Regardless of how ReSource gets its input, it can save the  contents  of  its
buffer in any of the following ways:

   1. Save as an Amiga® executable program
   2. Save as a binary image
   3. Save directly to memory
   4. Save to floppy disk sectors/cylinders
   5. Save as an ".RS" file
   6. Save as an ".asm" file

NOTE: RSDemo, the demonstration version of ReSource will not  save  anything.
This information is provided for those considering the commercial version.


ONLINE HELP
===========
ReSource contains a complete online help facility.  This silent assistant  is
fast and easy to use.

The online help facility contains documentation on each  and  every  function
that  can  be selected from the menus.  There is also a glossary of terms and
phrases.   To  begin online help, press the "Help" key, or select "Help" from
the PROJECT menu.

Hyper-help
==========
While you are viewing the documentation on any particular function,  you  may
notice  that  various words and phrases are lightly underlined.  By using the
left and right arrow keys, you can hilite one of these words or phrases,  and
by  then  pressing  the  return  key,  ReSource  will immediately display the
documentation that pertains to that word or phrase.  While  in  this  "nested
help" mode, you have only to press the backspace key, to go back to where you
were.   For example, while viewing the documentation on the "CURSOR/Relative/
Next line", you may be wondering what the word "cursor" means.   By  pressing
the  right  arrow  key  until the word "cursor" is hilited, and then pressing
return, you will be shown the  part  of  the  glossary  that  describes  what
"cursor"  means  in ReSource.  Now satisfied, you may press the backspace key
to continue reading the documentation on "CURSOR/Relative/Next line".

You  can  get  nested  help within nested help.  There is a limit to just how
many positions within the help files ReSource will remember (256 levels), but
it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever approach this limit.  In fact, it
is unlikely that you will nest to a  depth  of  more  than  three  in  normal
operation.

Help on Help
============
While inside the help facility, there are a number of keys that can  be  used
for  specific  purposes.   The most important one to remember is the help key
itself, which tells you what the various keys do.  Here are a few of the more
important ones:

	Help			Display this table
	Escape			Exit from the online help facility
	Down/Up arrows		Move forward/backward through text
	Left/Right arrow	Use to hilite a word/phrase
	Return			If word/phrase hilited, get help on it
	Alt-down arrow		Move forward to end of text
	Alt-up arrow		Move to start of text
	Backspace		Return to previous level
