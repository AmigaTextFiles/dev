Type:      dev/asm

A set of macros to remove some of the hassle of playing sound samples.

Very simple to use.

PLEASE MAIL ME IF YOU USE THIS.


Installing:     1) Move SimpleAudio.i to wherever you want,
                preferably with the rest of the include files.
                (I put it in misc/ with the rest of the includes)




Usage:          1) At the top of you code insert 
                <include WhereYouPutSimpleAudio/SimpleAudio.i>

                SimpleAudio needs the standard include files, and
                looks for an assign "include:" to the includes directory.
                If you do not have this assign then edit the 6 th line of
                SimpleAudio.i to point to your includes.

                NOTE:  If you do not have the standard includes but would
                like to use this include then please MailMe and I will make 
                a version that does not need the standard includes.  One
                mail is enough.


                There are 3 Commands available from simple audio:

                a) ALLOCAUDIO   Channels, Priority

                b) DEALLOCAUDIO

                c) Play  Sample, Length, Frequency/Period, Volume, Flags, Repetitions


a: ALLOCAUDIO   Channels:       YOU HAVE TO SUPPLY THIS.  One or more of:
                                LEFT1, RIGHT1, LEFT2, RIGHT2

                Priority:       A number between -128 and +127, or
                                one of:

                                *UNSTOPPABLE
                                EMERGENCIES
                                ATTENTION
                                SPEECH
                                INFORMATION
                                MUSIC
                                EFFECT
                                BACKGROUND
                                *SILENCE

                * These should no be used unless you know what you are doing.

                As you can probably tell the higher up the list that you select
                the priority the more chances there are of the allocation will
                succeed.  YOU CAN SAFELY LEAVE THIS AS 0

                Eg.     ALLOCAUDIO      #LEFT1,MUSIC

                or      ALLOCAUDIO      #LEFT1!RIGHT1,0

      or      ALLOCAUDIO      #RIGHT2!,20


                OUTPUT: 0 if successful or an error code otherwise.

b) DEALLOCAUDIO         Needs no input.

c) PLAY          Sample: Pointer to a Sample.  


                Length: The length of the sample.


                Frequence/Period:       The frequency or the period of the sample.
                                        If you specify the period, then you set
                                        the PERIOD flag in the flags field.

                                        NOTE: if on specifying frequency the
                                        frequency of the sound does not sound right
                                        and your machine runs on NTSC then edit
                                        SimpleAudio.i and change line 54 from
                                        CLOCK = PAL_CLOCK    to
                                        CLOCK = NTSC_CLOCK.

                                        If it still does not sound right, then
                                        mail me.

                Volume: Easy to explain.  Set to any value from 0 to 64.

                Flags:  Use these flags to specify which channel to play on,
                        weather you are supplying frequency or period, and
                        weather the routine should wait for the sound to finish
                        playing or just return immediately.

                        NOTE:  VERY IMPORTANT.  If after this routine returns
                        you will immediately call DEALLOCAUDIO, then you MUST
                        set the WAIT flag.

                Repititions:  The number of times that the sample will be repeated.
                              A value of 0 is ignored and the sample is played once.



        Eg.     PLAY    #Sample, #Len, #22000, #64, #RIGHT1!WAIT

                PLAY    _Sample, #1235, #124 , #53, #LEFT1!PERIOD!WAIT

                PLAY    _Sample, Len, Freq, Vol, #LEFT1
