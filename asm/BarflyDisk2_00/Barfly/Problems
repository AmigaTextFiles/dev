   ->jsr FindTask.l !!!!!!

   2) Parameter=Comment

   so the CALLEXEC Macros looks like this:

   CALLEXEC FindTask  ;Comment
   you have no problem.

 o If you don't like that the Shellwindow isn't closed after the program
   quits you should set another Shell definition in the configuration
   files.

 o If BDebug hello doesn't open the following windows something goes
   wrong.

   o Register Window

   o Disassembler Window

   o Memory Window

   o Source Window

   o Struct Window(Empty..you have to fill it with a structure->Menus)


 o If the Demoversion stops after a lot debug steps you have reached
   one of the **** Demo Version Limitations*.


 o If you think some windows are too small when they opened you should
   change the window dimensions in the configuration files.


 o Please **read** the s/Barfly/Barfly.DebugConfig first to get an
   impression what you can configurate.

 o If the assembler shows some kind of width access error you should
   look for the options -b0,-b1,-b2,-B0,-B1,-B2,-n0,-n1 that determine
   the default width of a data field.
