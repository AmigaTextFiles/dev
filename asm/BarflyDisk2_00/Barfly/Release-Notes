     for Markus Schmall but though I have the same source I am unable
     to reproduce it....sigh

   - Add PPC mtspr/mfspr Machine/Supervisor check

 o BASM Changes

V2.08
 - Fixed:
         o PPC relative16 size check
         o FNOP instruction size increase was wrong which caused wrong addresses

         o Release version disables the PPC because the ELF object output
           stage isn`t done yet and the PPC part is custom for my needs.
           It`s not completely done.

         o Possible problems with writing of xdef,xref symbols
           that can lead to write file sizes that have nothing
           to do with the real file size. Used word instead of long.
V1.116     (Stupid)

 - Fixed:
         o Possible enforcer hit in certain circumstances
V1.115
 - Fixed:
         o Silly bug in verbose output. The optimize passes
           were accidently output when multiple pass wasn't
           even activated.

V1.114
 - Fixed:
         o Option OD5 had no function
           cmp.l #0,ea wasn't optimized by accident

           Optimize wasn't activated.

V1.111

           Parser problem...could be visible in other things.

         o Several serious code bugs i added close before the final
           release into the fpu command handling(Not by intention:-b)

         o RTM,RTD error output improved

         o cachefile.library crash in a certain situation(read error)

         o enabled cpush for 68060

         o bfextu parsing problem...i know it worked sometime:-B

         o divul.l/mulx.l 68060 error detection was suboptimal:-B

         o macros starting with the substring FMOVECR fooled the parser

         o double symbols in symbol hunk

         o bkpt machine detection for 68010/20 broken

         o cas2.b bug

         o reworked processor/instruction table in the manual.
           It's worth it now:-B

         o FMOVE.S	#0.01,FP0 error...includes a lot weird float #x problems

 - Improved
         o Precompiled Hash error reason.


V1.109

 - Fixed:
         o Possible Enforcer Hit in BFINS

         o link a5,#-4<TAB><TAB>..bug

         o Problem with SET and Labels..(Neil Blackett)

         o BASM crash with Snoopdos 1.7 when started from the WB...
           Wondering that i haven't noticed it earlier.

         o $01 Bug

         o BASM Format problem

 - Improved:
         o Error location output

         o Now it doesn't ignore >> in macro parameters

         o Now accepts (bd,dn) if BD Width = 0..in this case Width=.w is assumed.

V1.106

         o dc.b " " Bug

V1.105

 - Fixed:
         o Now it outputs relocatable also if XREF symbols are accessed.(Alex)

         o move.l -4(an),an->move.l -(an),an optimizing(Alex)

         o Option -J that creates the file env:BDebugProgram
           that BDebug checks when it is started with no parameter.

         o command BDEBUGARG that can be used to define an argument
           in env:BDebugProgram

V1.104

  - Initial Release

##########################################################################

 o BDEBUG Todo

   - DissWindow on lvo function pop up an autodocs window if requested
   - divul.l	(a0,d0.l*4),d3:d2 EA calculation problem..basicly for all 4 byte commands(should be fixed now too)
   - Fix GCC multi source problem
   - Fix cybergfx penmode problem in edit mode
   - Rewrite everything to C....well mostly.

 o BDEBUG Changes

   - Note: Changes starting from V1.699 were done by
           Niels Boehm <blubberdiblub (at) gmail (dot) com>.

V1.702
 - Improved:
         o Internal only: Split off program version into separate object file.

V1.701
 - Fixed:
         o When parsing a gcc stabs debug hunk, trying to load a source file
           that doesn't exist in any of the paths would hang the debugger.

 - Improved:
         o A source file would only be searched for in the working directory
           where BDebug was started (which would be BDebug's PROGDIR: in case
           it was started from Workbench, for instance) and in the configured
           paths. Now it is first searched for in the directory obtained from
           the debug hunk, if any, then in the directory where the object file
           resides and finally in the configured paths.

V1.700
 - Fixed:
         o Hunk parser stopped after reading the last hunk listed in the
           HUNK_HEADER, which prevented it from reading debug hunks in object
           files with correctly formed HUNK_HEADER.

V1.699
 - Fixed:
         o Disassembly/PC line in register window was misplaced when SegTracker
           line wasn't displayed due to SegTracker not running.


V1.698
V1.697
V1.696
V1.695
V1.694
V1.693
V1.692
V1.691
V1.690
V1.689
 - Note:
         o Unfortunately, I don't have information on those releases. I only
           received the sources without accompanying history -- Niels Boehm

V1.688
 - Fixed:
         o CRASHEDTASK config cmd enforcer hit

V1.687
 - Fixed:
         o Mungwall in the Alias management(Bjorge)

V1.686
 - Fixed:
         o bfxxx bug with a Width of 32...

           TRUE test

         o Fixed divu->sbcd disassemble bug

         o EA calculation with move and if the 1st operand needs an extra word/long

         o Barfly.Include.S changes
           o some comments(bad english)
           o STRUCTURE name,offset where offset != 0
             for example asl.i/FileRequester used this and
             the StructWindow showed the wrong values/offsets

 - Improved:
         o Log Output also shows registers now
           (But the log output style sucks in general)

         o I always wondered why i couldn`t set an illegal into a lib to crash in LibInit(RamLib)
           task but i was always too lazy to find the reason until now:-)
           ramlib task has a tc_TrapCode of NULL which is illegal and because it was an unknown
           routine i skipped it in my patch task trapcode function.


V1.685
 - Fixed:
         o Memory Window search/next requester was broken
V1.684
 - Fixed:
         o mulu.l ,dn n always 0 bug
         o SnoopMemory Window didn`t work at all.
           Wondering why nobody noticed:-)
           Was caused by a source cleanup months
           ago...don't even know when i did that.
           But it worked one time...seriously:-)
         o Multiselect crashes with certain menus
         o Fixed crash with Memory Fill

V1.683

 - Fixed:
         o Mungwall hit in connection with the barfly.library and a flush.
           (Sorry...)

 - Improved:
         o I never really liked the Task listview and the code was already
           that old it started to smell....so i rewrote it.
           Now you can detect a process at the [] after the Task name.
           The [] extension shows the process number and the cli name if
           these exist.

         o Now the information windows that haven't reacted on the cursor
           buttons react now


V1.680

         o Mouseclick bug in a big regwindow with the (EA) field.

 - Added:
         o Shift-Tab goes through the windows backwards

         o ADDSTRUCTFILE= config command...allows the addition of
           custom struct files into CUSTOM/

         o NEWWINDOW menu option in the Structwindow so that if you
           use links(like in Node) it should open a new window instead
           of using the current.

         o NEWWINDOW new STRUCTFLAGS= config option

V1.673
 - Fixed:
         o Uggghh...long time bug..disassembler outputs fmovecr #x,d0
           instead of fmovecr #x,fpn
 - Added:
         o Cyberstorm 060 Support added


V1.672
 - Fixed:
         o Crash when configurated that Breakpoint/Watchpoint
           windows are opened by the Barfly.Debugconfig file.
           Really fixed ? I don't even know why it crashes...
           It crashes when i get the Supervisor register and i
           have not the slightest clue why it happens only when
           these 2 windows are opened. I removed the Supervisor
           routine because it's not really necessary to load
           these registers at that time.

 - Improved:
         o SnoopWindow full dimension parsing.


V1.671
 - Fixed:
         o Watchpoint Argument Check Hit
