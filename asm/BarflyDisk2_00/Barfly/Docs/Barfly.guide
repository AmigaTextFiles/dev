Registration
============

   Well...i decided to release it as GiftWare now with a PUBLIC key.
The PPC/ELF support may be useful for some people and i just don`t have
the time anymore to handle some few registrations.  If somebody thinks
it`s a nice product he`s free to send me whatever he thinks is
appropriate.

   @{i}Here you can read the old registration text...@{ui}

   As you may have noticed in the copyright I'm working for five years
at Barfly. It has always consumed and will continue to consume a large
amount of my time.

   I cannot afford just working for fun. Thus, I decided to release
Barfly as Shareware. I had already tried to release Barfly as a
commercial product but the story behind it is more than sad. To sum
it...german Amiga software companys aren't worth any time...@{b}they suck@{ub}.
Some people may think the price is too high for a Shareware product but
i think that BAsm is as powerful as the 2 main available commercial
Assemblers...if not more powerful if you compare the speed and the
optimize functions;there's no commercial Debugger available that can
compete with BDebug.  I've used Barfly myself for commercial Amiga
applications.  Cyberstorm 060, Z3-Fastlane device, CDRive,
SCSIConfig,...

   The unregistered version of Barfly pops up the About requester at
the start and has some functions disabled:
     Assembler:
      o only 8192Bytes large code possible
      o the Section commands aren't available
     Debugger:
      o Only 1 Window per Object
      o Enforcer,CyberGuard Catch not available
      o Task Catch not available
      o Crashed Task Catch not available
      o Limited Step count(about 150-200 Steps)

   Registered users will be shipped a disk with the newest public
release of Barfly, along with a personalized, so-called "keyfile". It
enables all the missing features and disables the Shareware reminders.
This keyfile will work with all future releases of Barfly, so you can
simply download the latest version from your local bulletin board
without having to wait weeks for your update passing through the slow
mail channels. The keyfile @{b}must not@{ub} be distributed in any way.

The fee for a Barfly registration is
      70.- DM  (D-Mark),
      70.- SFr (Schweizer Franken),
     230.- FF  (French Francs),
      50.- US$ (US Dollar)

   There is NO splitted version available. Only Barfly and Basm
together.

   The fastest, cheapest and easiest way to register is put the money
together with the filled registration form into a letter and send it to

   Please allow 2-8 weeks delivery for the registrated version.
Currently I am very busy with my civil service and working for Phase5 so
please be patient.

System requirements
===================

   Barfly requires Amiga operating system version 2.04 or better.

   Kickstart 1.3 is @{i}not@{ui} supported; this operating system is considered
obsolete.

   Barfly requires at least one megabyte of RAM to run.  A hardisk or a
faster CPU is not required but increase performances and comfort, of
course.

Installation
============

   It is really easy to install Barfly:

   1. Copy the the binary and the icon (called "BDebug" and
"BDebug.info")   to any directory.

   2. Copy the the binary and the icon (called "BAsm" and "BAsm.info")
to any directory.

   Then copy the supplied configuration files from "s/Barfly/#?" to "S:"
directory of your system partition or create env:Barflypath with the
path to a directory that contains Barfly/#?.

Updates
=======

   Whenever a new release of Barfly gets released, I will post some
information in the appropriate newsgroups of some electronic networks.
The new archive will soon be available on many bulletin boards and on
all @{b}AmiNet@{ub} FTP servers. Major releases will also come with some PD
disks, especially on Fred Fish's collection.

   As mentioned above, registered users will neither need a new keyfile
nor a special personalized program version. They can use all new
features immediately.

Here are some ideas for future versions of BDebug:

   @{b}*@{ub} Full Source Level support for GCC and perhaps SAS.

   @{b}*@{ub} Better BDebug Arexx support...the current one is a bad excuse.

   @{b}*@{ub} Mungwall Trace methods.

   @{b}*@{ub} Automatic Refresh of some Windows(Task Window...)

   @{b}*@{ub} Amigaguide file mode in the autodocs functions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Highlight changed registers

   @{b}*@{ub} Better documentation.

   @{b}*@{ub} BAsmOption for the easy BAsm options configuration.

   @{b}*@{ub} Other things i'm too lazy to mention now.

Important:
     There is absolutely NO guarantee that these features will ever be
     implemented. So don't be disappointed, if they aren't in the next
     version.

Usage of BDebug
***************

The Command Window
==================

Debugger Philosophy
===================

   BDebug is a multitasking Debugger that supports the Motorola
processors 68000...68060 and 68881...68882.  The Debugger allows to
debug unlimited tasks parallel.  Because of the Debugger's complexity
BDebug was designed in an object-oriented way to allow an easy and
comfortable way to use it.  The register window @{b}REGWindow@{ub} is the Root
class of the task object that can be expanded by several subclass
windows.  Every subclass window has privat menus and inherits the
public menus of its father object.

Debug Methods
=============

   The Debugger offers a variety of different Debug methods that can be
activated by menu or gadget.

Debug Task
..........

   is used to select a task you wann to debug. If you doubleclick on a
task a @{b}REGWindow@{ub} and a couple of information windows opens.  Which type
and how many are opened depends on the current configuration.  After
the task could be stopped the contents of the @{b}REGWindow@{ub} and all other
information windows gets refreshed.  If the task is in the @{b}Wait@{ub} state
the task is stopped when it gets a signal.

                         Task Listview Layout

                                   
                Taskaddress & Priority & Status & Name

                        Process Listview Layout

                                   
      Taskaddress & Priority & Status & Name[CLI Number,CLI Name]

   You should know what task you can stop and what kind of task should
never be stopped. For example the Input.device should never be stopped.

Debug File
..........

   is used to load and stop a program.  This function is equal to the
bdebug cli startup with the exception that you can enter the parameter
in a requester.  If no error occur all configurated windows are opened
and the PC stops at the defined programstart breakpoint that normally
points to the first command of the program.

Debug Next Task
...............

   is used to debug the next task that is opened.  The Debugger waits
until another task is created by AddTask and a couple of information
windows opens.  Which type and how many are opened depends on the
current configuration.  After the new task was caught the pc points to
the beginning of the task and @{b}Catch Next Task@{ub} is disactivated.  To
catch a program that is started from the WV you have to use @{b}Debug Next
Task@{ub} to catch the WB Startup Task @{b}WBL@{ub} that starts the program.  Now you
have to activate @{b}Debug Next Task@{ub} again and let the current task run.
After a short time the task @{b}WBL@{ub} ends and the program's task is caught.

     You should avoid to start a new task between the 2 @{b}Debug Next Task@{ub}
     phases because it's easy to catch the wrong one.


     You should notice that @{b}AddTask@{ub} is patched and points to a new
     routine. Thus you should be careful with programs that also patch
     @{b}AddTask@{ub}. Furthermore it's useful to know in what sequences these
     patches have to be removed.  The Debugger can only be closed when
     all patched system function that were installed after the Debugger
     was started are removed.


     If you start a program in the shell without @{b}c:Run@{ub} no new task is
     created. Instead the program is run as a subroutine in shell's
     task so you can't catch the task that easy.


Debug Crashed Task
..................

   is used to catch tasks that crash so you track down the bug location
a lot easier. If the system itself doesn't run anymore you shouldn't
expect that bdebug still runs because it depends on a working system.
If a task crashes and the option @{b}Debug Crashed Task@{ub} is activated a
couple of information windows opens. Which type and how many are opened
depends on the current configuration.  @{b}Task Held Requester@{ub}.

Catch Enforcer Hit
..................

   is used to tell the Debugger to stop the task it controls when an
Enforcer or CyberGuard hit happens.  Unfortunately the Debugger can't
always stop the task at exactly the same location where the hit
happened.  Mostly the hit command is 1-2 instructions above the stopped
task's PC.

   This function needs Enforcer V37.x by M. Sinz or CyberGuard V1.x and
it must be installed before BDebug is launched.  Please read the
documentation.

Select Display Mode
...................

   This function allows you to choose Screen Mode for the Debugger.

How to start ?
==============

   If you only want to debug a program you have to start bdebug with
the program's name and parameters or by using @{b}Debug Program@{ub} in the
command window.  Another method is to move a program's icon on the
command window or specify BDebug as in the icon as the @{b}DefaultTool@{ub}.

   @{b}Name:@{ub}

     BDEBUG - The CLI Startup


   @{b}Synopnis:@{ub}

     BDEBUG [?] [<Program> [Argument] ]


   @{b}Function:@{ub}

     BDebug activates the Debugger, loads and stops the optionally
     entered program. If it can find a local config file with  the
     suffix *.bdebug it loads it.


   @{b}Inputs@{ub}

        @{b}*@{ub} ? shows an information message

        @{b}*@{ub} program name If no program name is entered BDebug looks for
          env:BDebugProgram and loads the program instead that the env:
          points to.

        @{b}*@{ub} argument line of the program. If there are spaces in
          parameters you have to enclose the argument with @{b}""@{ub}.

Register Window
---------------

   The register window is the most important control layer of the
Debugger and every debugged task has one.  You can link unlimited other
information windows to the @{b}REGWindow@{ub} or you can tell the Debugger to
give up controling the task.  In the title line of the window you can
see the ID number of the task, so you can recognize what information
window belongs to this task.  Furthermore the title line also contains
the task address, the state, @{b}RUN@{ub}, @{b}WAIT@{ub} or @{b}STOP@{ub} and the name of the task.
The task is in the @{b}RUN@{ub} state if the task has the control at the moment
instead of the traphandler; the task is in the @{b}STOP@{ub} state when the task
waits and the traphandler controls what happens.  The task is the @{b}WAIT@{ub}
state only when the Debugger has to wait to catch a task by a @{b}Debug
Task@{ub}.  In the upper area of the window you see the normal data and
address registers where the address register also have additional
information fields.  To change a register or to watch memory where the
register points to you only need to doubleclick on the register or on
the register's memory contents.  Furthermore you may change other
usermode registers by this method.  Supervisor register can't be
changed because that doesn't make much sense for a system Debugger.

                       @{b}68000 Registers@{ub}

   @{b}*@{ub} [!] shows if the address register points on an odd address.

   @{b}*@{ub} if the address register points on an illegal memory area the char
     @{b}*@{ub} is shown in Arg1 and Arg2 to avoid crashes by reading non
     readable io-addresses.  You can config the readable memory areas.

   @{b}*@{ub} if the address register points on the following system structures
     the name of the Node is shown in Arg1 and the Name of the
     structure in Arg2.

        @{b}*@{ub} Library

        @{b}*@{ub} Device

        @{b}*@{ub} Port

        @{b}*@{ub} Task

        @{b}*@{ub} Resource

        @{b}*@{ub} MemHead

   @{b}*@{ub} if the address register points to the custom chip area the name of
     the register is shown in Arg1 and the ID-Word CUSTOM is shown in
     Arg2.  Custom register map is $dff000-$dff200.

   @{b}*@{ub} if the address register points to a symbol the symbol and the
     contents is shown.

   @{b}*@{ub} Otherwise 8Bytes of the memory are shown where the register points
     to.  The 8 Bytes are shown hexadecimal in Arg1 and ascii in Arg2.

   @{b}*@{ub} Close Window

     closes the @{b}REGWindow@{ub}, all connected windows and disactivates the
     Debugger for this task.  To disactivate the Debugger you have to
     choose if the task should keep running so it's the task's business
     to stop.  Furthermore you can end the task by runing the cleanup
     routine of the task or just removing the task from the list but
     this can cause sideeffects you can't always oversee.  If the task
     is a process then the Remove option is equal to the Cleanup option.
     If it's only a task the Cleanup option is equal to the Cleanup
     option.  Note that the Remove option doesn't free any resources of
     the task.

          You should really know what you're doing if you, for example,
          remove a task from the system.


   @{b}*@{ub} ZOOM Windows

     expands all windows of the task.

   @{b}*@{ub} Log File

     activates or disactivates the loging of the register and PC
     changes.  Tip: Use CNC:0/0/640/100/History as the logfile and you
     get an      automatic logfile history.

   @{b}*@{ub} Big View

     shrinks the @{b}REGWindow@{ub} to a 68000 register layout or expands it
     back to the full layout.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open DissWindow

     opens a DissWindow with the configured dimensions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open MemWindow

     opens a MemWindow with the configured dimensions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open FPUWindow

     opens a FPUWindow with the configured dimensions.  The menu is
     only available if a FPU is installed.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open BreakWindow

     opens a BreakpointWindow with the configured dimensions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open CoppWindow

     opens a CoppWindow with the configured dimensions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open StructWindow

     opens a StructWindow with the configured dimensions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open SnoopWindow

     opens a SnoopWindow with the configured dimensions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open WatchWindow

     opens a WatchpointWindow with the configured dimensions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open ChecksumWindow

     opens a ChecksumWindow with the configured dimensions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Save Window Settings

     saves the positions and count of all window the current task
     controls.  The saved file then contains the appropriate commands
     you have to enter yourself into the configuration file.  Because
     of the Debugger's window concept it doesn't make sense to save a
     complete configuration file.

------------

   @{b}*@{ub} Step 1

     runs the current command and stops the task afterwords.

   @{b}*@{ub} Step X

     runs X commands and stops the task afterwards.

   @{b}*@{ub} Step Debug Line

     runs commands until the PC encounters another source line.  If the
     PC is outside the program or if no debug informations are
     available a single step i used.  The command enters subroutines.

   @{b}*@{ub} Trace Debug Line

     is similar to @{b}Step Debug Line@{ub} with the exception that it runs
     subroutines.

   @{b}*@{ub} Trace over Calls

     runs the current command or subroutine and stops the task
     afterwards.  Depending on the configuration and the memory area a
     breakpoint or single steps are used.  If a crash happens in
     certain program parts you should remove the command @{b}Tracebreak@{ub}
     from the configuration.

          You should avoid to use @{b}Tracebreak@{ub} in Libraries and Devices
          which are located in the ram.  If another task accesses the
          routine at the same time you can expect an illegal exception.


          Some Amiga MMU Setups don't like programs writing to the
          kickstart rom. For example when breakpoints are set.


   @{b}*@{ub} Trace X over Calls

     runs X commands or subroutines and stops the task afterwards.
     Depending on the configuration and the memory area a breakpoint or
     single steps are used.

   @{b}*@{ub} Trace Work

     is similar to the command @{b}Trace over Calls@{ub} with the exception that
     all commands are run.  This function is useful to trace loops.


          Example:
                     moveq        #10,d0
                 0$:
                     dbra         d0,0$

          If you use the function on the command @{b}dbra@{ub} the Debugger sets
          a breakpoint after the dbra and runs the task. It drops back
          to single step when it hits a @{b}Jmp@{ub}, @{b}bra@{ub}, @{b}rts@{ub} ....


   @{b}*@{ub} Trace over OS-Calls

     runs the current command or the OS function and stops the task
     afterwards.

   @{b}*@{ub} Trace on Flow

     stops the task when a PC direction occurs.  This means the PC is
     stopped when it hits a @{b}Jsr@{ub}, @{b}Jmp@{ub}, @{b}bcc@{ub}, @{b}rts@{ub} ....

   @{b}*@{ub} Trace on Address

     runs the task until the PC is equal to the entered address.  This
     function is not very fast because the task is running in single
     step mode and after each instruction the PC is compared with the
     address.

   @{b}*@{ub} Trace out of OS

     runs the task until the PC is outside of the kickstart.  This
     function is useful when you catch a task inside the OS and you
     want to get as fast as possible back to the program's code.  It
     works similar as @{b}Trace on address@{ub}.

          You shouldn't use this command if your task only runs in the
          kickstart.


   @{b}*@{ub} (PC)++

     jumps over the current command.  Useful to jump over @{b}Illegal@{ub}
     breakpoints used for debugging purposes in your program.

   @{b}*@{ub} PC-2

     subtracts 2 Bytes from the PC.

   @{b}*@{ub} Write Nop

     overwrites the current command with a @{b}Nop@{ub}.

   @{b}*@{ub} Write Illegal

     overwrites the current command with an @{b}Illegal@{ub}.

   @{b}*@{ub} Run Task

     runs the task and stops only on exceptions.

   @{b}*@{ub} Run Watched Task

     runs the task in trace mode and stops when a WatchPoint condition
     is true.  If there are no watchpoints the command behaves like @{b}Run
     Task@{ub}.

   @{b}*@{ub} Run History Task

     runs the task in trace mode and saves the registers each step into
     the history stack.

   @{b}*@{ub} Stop Task

     stops the task.

   @{b}*@{ub} Send Signal

     sends a signal to the task.  Default Signal is CTRL-C = 12

   @{b}*@{ub} Undo Level

     sets the undobuffer's depth.

   @{b}*@{ub} Undo

     undos the last changes in the registerframe.

   @{b}*@{ub} View Refresh

     activates and disactivates the copperlist refresh after each trace
     operation. This function is help for debugging programs which
     install own copperlists.

   @{b}*@{ub} Show (EA)

     activates and disactivates the output of the address and address
     contents which are accessed by the current assembler command.

   @{b}*@{ub} Symbol

     activates and disactivates the use of symbols in the @{b}REGWindow@{ub}.

   @{b}*@{ub} Delete Symbols

     erases all symbols of the task.

   @{b}*@{ub} Copy Symbols

     can copy a symbol list of the task to a different task.  This
     function is helpful if your task is started from another task and
     you want to keep the symbol list.

   @{b}*@{ub} Load Symbols

     loads the symbols of a program where you can select an alternative
     process's segmentlist for calculating the symbol and debug
     informations.  Normally you choose the same process but sometimes
     it's helpful to select a different process.  For example, if the
     task you debug is created in a program, you have to choose the
     program's task to get the correct symbol addresses.

   @{b}*@{ub} Set Hunklist

     sets a new segment list for the SourceWindow and some other hunk
     related functions.  Because the position in the SourceWindow
     depends on the segments sometimes help to load new symbols and
     debug informations for this task.  If you load an alternative
     Hunklist by selecting a custom task when you use @{b}Load Symbols@{ub}.

   @{b}*@{ub} Reset Hunklist

     removes the alternative hunklist.

   @{b}*@{ub} Show Value

     shows the value of an argument.

   @{b}*@{ub} Show Last Exception

     shows the last exception.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Task Window

     opens a window showing the task structure of the task.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open System Window

     opens a window showing the ExecBase structure.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Proces Window

     opens a window showing the process structure of the process.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open CLI Window

     opens a window showing the cli structure of the process.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Hunk Window

     opens a window showing the hunks of the process.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Symbol Window

     opens a window showing the symbols of the process.  If you
     doubleclick on a symbol you get the hunk where the symbol is
     located.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Library Window

     opens a window showing the libraries.  If you doubleclick on a
     library entry it opens a @{b}FD:@{ub} window that shows all functions of
     the library when the library is defined in the @{b}Barfly.FD@{ub} file.
     Furthermore if you doublelick on a function you have the choice to
     see the function in a @{b}DissWindow@{ub} or the autodocs documentation.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Device Window

     opens a window showing the devices.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Resource Window

     opens a window showing the resources.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Port Window

     opens a window showing the public ports.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Resident Window

     opens a window showing the resident modules.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open Interrupt Window

     opens a window showing the interrupts.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open AutoDocs Window

     opens a filerequester which lets you choose the needed autodocs
     information of a library.  This opens a window which shows all
     functions of the chosen autodoc file.  If you now click on a
     function another window is opened showing the function
     documentation.

   @{b}*@{ub} Open History Window

     opens a HistoryWindow showing the last saved registerframes of the
     undobuffer. The undobuffer is organized in a way to make the first
     entry become the last entry in the HistoryWindow.  The
     HistoryWindow isn't updated automaticlly.

   @{b}*@{ub} Stack Check

     controls the stack check. A warning is displayed if the register
     A7 points out of the stack bounds or points on an odd address.
     The Debugger only checks the task when the task gives back the
     control to the traproutine, so it's not possible to notice every
     stack problem.

          You should be aware that this function doesn't work with a
          WShell task because the @{b}WShell@{ub} doesn't set the correct stack
          task values.


   @{b}*@{ub} Find Task of address

     tries to find the task which belongs to the entered address.  The
     command checks if the address is in the task, process, cli,
     mementry structure and the hunks.  It's not safe to assume that
     the function can check all cases.

   @{b}*@{ub} Load Binary

     loads a file with an optional length into a memory area.  If you
     want the Debugger to automaticlly allocate the memory block you
     have to close the memory requester.

   @{b}*@{ub} Save Binary

     saves a memory area into a file.

   @{b}*@{ub} Freeze Task

     freezes a selectable task.  When bdebug ends the frozen tasks are
     awakened again.

   @{b}*@{ub} Warm up Task

     warms up a frozen task.

   @{b}*@{ub} Kill Task

     kills a selectable task.

          You should know which task you can kill.  For example, don't
          kill the input.device or your filesystem.


   @{b}*@{ub} Show Task

     shows the task structure of a selectable task.

   @{b}*@{ub} Show Prozess

     shows the process structure of a selectable process.

   @{b}*@{ub} Show CLI

     shows the cli structure of a selectable process.

   @{b}*@{ub} Show Hunk

Disassembler window
-------------------

   The @{b}DissWindow@{ub} shows the memory contents in assembler mnemonics. The
address of the window's view can be absolute or relative.  In absolut
mode, the window shows the contents of a fixed address, indicated by
the window title @{b}No Link@{ub}.  In relative mode the window is connected to
a register causing the window to update when the the register value
changes.  This is indicated by the window title which reads @{b}Link to *@{ub},
where * represents the register name.  The PC is shown by the colour
pen 2.  If the linked register value is outside of the window's view
area the whole contents of the window will be refreshed.  You can
change size of the window and scroll through the memory area by using
the cursors.  In the title you see an ID-String with the format @{b}\#x.y@{ub}
where @{b}X@{ub} represents the @{b}REGWindow@{ub} number and @{b}y@{ub} the number of the
@{b}MemWindow@{ub}.  Doubleclicking a line of the window sets or remove a
breakpoint.  You can disable this function in the configuration.

CopperWindow
------------

   The @{b}CopperWindow@{ub} shows the memory contents as copper commands.  The
window is sizeable, and you can use the cursor keys to scroll through
the memry area.  In the title you see an ID-String with the format
@{b}\#x.y@{ub} where @{b}X@{ub} represents the @{b}REGWindow@{ub} number and @{b}y@{ub} the number of
the @{b}CoppWindow@{ub}.

StructWindow
------------

   opens window which can be connected with a structure.  You can use
new structure entries by expanding the the
@{b}<BarflyPath>/Barfly/Barfly.Include@{ub} file or loading a new custom file.
By a doubleclick on a structure window entry you can cause several
actions depending on the datatype.  Every datatype is connected with an
action that is normally started automaticlly.  With the configuration
command @{b}NoAutoStructAction@{ub} you can change this behaviour so that an
action type requester is opened.

   The following datatypes are available.

   @{b}*@{ub} APTR opens a MemWindow.

   @{b}*@{ub} CSTR shows a string.

   @{b}*@{ub} BPTR opens a MemWindow at the address BPTR*4.

   @{b}*@{ub} BSTR shows a string at the address (BPTR*4)+1

   @{b}*@{ub} CPTR opens a DissWindow.

   @{b}*@{ub} FPTR opens a DissWindow.

   @{b}*@{ub} BYTE doesn't cause an action.

   @{b}*@{ub} WORD doesn't cause an action.

   @{b}*@{ub} LONG doesn't cause an action.

   @{b}*@{ub} FLOAT doesn't cause an action.

   @{b}*@{ub} DOUBLE doesn't cause an action.

   @{b}*@{ub} EXTENDED doesn't cause an action.

   @{b}*@{ub} RPTR doesn't cause an action.

   The following action types are available.

   @{b}*@{ub} MemWindow opens a MemWindow.

   @{b}*@{ub} DissWindow opens a DissWindow.

   @{b}*@{ub} CoppWindow opens a CoppWindow.

   @{b}*@{ub} StructWindow opens a StructWindow.

Structure Macro Fileformat
--------------------------

   This section describes the file format of structure macros.  In the
beginning you define the root directory entries with the first Macro
@{b}Menudir@{ub}.  The first parameter is the name of the entry, then the
address of the parent directory and then the address of the
subdirectory.  In the root directory the parent address is obviously
NULL.  The last entry of the directory is defined by the Macro
@{b}MENUDIREND@{ub}.

     @{b}Label                   ListViewMacro           Link@{ub}
     RootDir:
                             .
                             .
                             MENUDIR                 exec,0,Exec_Dir
                             .
                             .
     MYCUSTOMENTRY:
                             MENUDIREND              CUSTOM,0,0

   The design of a subdirectory only differs from the root directory
entries only by a parent directory address.

     @{b}Label                   ListViewMacro           Link@{ub}
     Exec_Dir:
                             .
                             .
                             MENUDIR                 nodes.i,RootDir,Nodes_Dir
                             .
                             .
                             MENUDIREND              tasks.i,RootDir,Tasks_Dir

   to define the structure directory entries you have to use @{b}MENUITEM@{ub}
and @{b}MENUITEMEND@{ub}.  The first parameter in the Item Macros is the name of
the entry and also the name of the structure.  The second parameter
defines the address of the parent directory.

     @{b}Label                   ListViewMacro           Link@{ub}
                             .
                             .
     Nodes_Dir:
                             MENUITEM                LN,Exec_Dir
                             .
                             .
                             MENUITEMEND

   To define a structure you can use the normal assembler syntax that
you probably have to adjust to your custom needs. For example you can
tell BDebug more informations about the datatype an entry represents.
By redefining @{b}APTR@{ub} to a @{b}CSTR@{ub} you can tell the Debugger that the entry
is a stringpointer.  Another example is defining that @{b}APTR@{ub} points to a
structure by @{b}APTR LN_SUCC,Node@{ub}.

     @{b}Label                   IncludeTypeMacro        Name,Link@{ub}
     LN_Struct:
                             STRUCTUREB              LN,0
                             APTR                    LN_SUCC,LN
                             APTR                    LN_PRED,LN
                             UBYTE                   LN_TYPE
                             BYTE                    LN_PRI
                             CCSTR                   LN_NAME
                             LABEL                   LN_SIZE

-----------------

   The @{b}Watchwindow@{ub} allows to set breakpoints that aren't depending on a
certain PC address but on other conditions.  Every watchpoint has a
condition, data width and can have one of 3 different watchpoints
states.  The @{b}Memory@{ub} watchpoint compares the saved contents of the
address with the current contents and dependent on the condition the
program is stopped or not.  The @{b}Register@{ub} watchpoint compares the saved
contents of a register with the current contents and dependent on the
condition the program is stopped or not.  The @{b}Argument@{ub} watchpoint
compares the saved value of an argument with the current contents and
dependent on the condition the program is stopped or not.  The last
watchpoint type is the most powerful because it can simulate the first
two types with the cost of a slowdown.  The use of watchpoints is very
time consuming because the whole program is run in single step mode.
In order to use watchpoi you have to run the task with @{b}Run Watched Task@{ub}.

     If an error occurs in the exception handler during the evaluation
     of a dynamic arugment, the screen flashes.

   @{b}*@{ub} \#ea? represents the address of the EA with the number ?.  Check
     Register Window.

   @{b}*@{ub} \#em? represents the contents where the address EA number ?
     points to.  Check Register Window. If the address EA is illegal an
     error is shown.

   @{b}*@{ub} \#ls  represents the start address of a loaded binary file.

   @{b}*@{ub} \#le  represents the end address of a loaded binary file.

   @{b}*@{ub} \#ll  represents the length address of a loaded binary file.

   @{b}*@{ub} \#p   represents the start address of the programs.  Only true for

Technical Informations
======================

Exceptions
----------

   The Debugger can catch all exceptions if the system is still working.
If an exception is caused, the traphandler catches the exception and
tells the Debugger what went on so it can react on the exception.  If
the exception wasn't caused by the Debugger, the type and the possible
reason for the exception is shown.  The @{b}Return-address@{ub} of the debugged
task points on an internal @{b}ILLEGAL@{ub}. If the processor encounters this
@{b}ILLEGAL@{ub} the task is closed and all windows are removed.  You shouldn't
step over this @{b}ILLEGAL@{ub} because it increases the possibility of a system
crash.  If a task is caught by @{b}Debug Next Task@{ub} and notices a custom
@{b}finalPC@{ub} routine in the @{b}Addtask()@{ub} function, the @{b}Return-address@{ub} isn't set
on the internal @{b}ILLEGAL@{ub} cleanup function because the @{b}finalPC@{ub} pointer is
sometimes used for parsing an argument.  In this case the Debugger
notices that the task ends by using the @{b}RemTask()@{ub} function.

     If the task changes the @{b}Return-address@{ub} the Debugger tries to
     determine the taskend by @{b}RemTask@{ub}.


Exception Handler
-----------------

   Every task has a pointer in its task structure that points to its
exception handler, named @{b}TC_TRAPCODE@{ub}.  When you load a program through
the Debugger, the Debugger's standard exception handler is installed.
It works basicly the same for @{b}Catch Next Task@{ub} and @{b}Debug Task@{ub}.  The only
difference is the @{b}Debug Crashed Task@{ub} mode where the Debugger sets a
special catch exception handler in each task that isn't controlled by
the Debugger.  When an exception occurs and the Debugger's exception
handler is called the Debugger first checks if it knows the task that
caused it.  If this is not the case something seriously is broken and
the Deadend Alert 35000000 will be popped up.  If all goes well the
registers are saved, the Debugger task gets a message and the exception
handler waits for a message by the Debugger to go on.  When the Debugger
gets the message it causes the appropriate function. For example
refreshing the windows.  If the Debugger gets a step command it sends
the exception handler the appropriate message and the handler does a
step.

Debug Informations
------------------

   Currently the following formats are supported.

   @{b}*@{ub} BASM Specialformat This format allows the Debugger to decide if
     the code is in the Mainpart, Includes or in a Macro.

   @{b}*@{ub} SAS D1 This format only allows a Source-Code connection.  It
     doesn't support local variables, Structures and Macros.

   @{b}*@{ub} GCC STABS This format is very powerful and offers all a
     source-level Debugger needs.  Unfortunately the Debugger only
     supports a simple Source-Code connection at the moment.  It's
     planned to support more in the future.

GCC Compiler and BDebug
-----------------------

   Unfortunately you can't debug programs that are using the current
@{b}ixemul.library@{ub} because in Openlibrary() initroutine the Task field
TC_TRAPCODE is changed.  Hopefully there'll be soon an @{b}ixemul.library@{ub}
available that doesn't change the traphandler.  If you're using GCC
with the link lib @{b}gerlib@{ub} that is available on Aminet FTP Servers you
shouldn't experience any problems with BDebug.

Usage of BDebug
***************

Configuration
=============

   The default configuration file is named @{b}BDEBUG.Config@{ub} and is located
in the directory @{b}<BarflyPath>/@{ub} or @{b}s:Barfly/@{ub}.  Obviously it's not
optimal to be forced to use the same config file for different
programs. Therefore you can also specify a local config file with
program name and the suffix @{b}.BDebug@{ub}.

Barfly.FD
---------

   Following steps are necessary to create a new @{b}Barfly.FD@{ub} file with
new library functions.  First the assign @{b}FD:@{ub} must point to the directory
containing the FD files that should be included in the new @{b}Barfly.FD@{ub}.
Make sure that every FD file contains the Library, Resource and Device
name in the first line in following format: @{b}* "foobar.libary"@{ub}.  If
necessary, add the name yourself, so that a correct FD database can be
build up.  If you're more experienced with FD files, you can yourself
add new entries to the @{b}Barfly.FD@{ub} file. The layout of the @{b}Barfly.FD@{ub} file
pretty obvious.

Usage of BDebug
***************

How to use BDebug ?
===================

Trouble Shooting
----------------

   First you should be sure that all necessary configurations file have
been installed because without @{b}Barfly.FD@{ub} file you don't see any
function names in the disassembler window; and without @{b}Barfly.Include@{ub}
the @{b}StructWindow@{ub} is unusable.  Are these preconditions fullfilled you
should analyse the problem and anticipate how the Debugger can be used.
Because the debugging of programs depends heavily on the situation i
can only list some general points.  The reality probably looks
different... as always:-)

   Point of departure:

   @{b}*@{ub} Program from the CLI

        @{b}*@{ub} 1 Task

          The program can be started by @{b}bdebug Program [Argument]@{ub} or
          can be loaded the command window @{b}Debug File@{ub}.  By this method
          all symbol and debug files are loaded.  If the Debugger can't
          find a source file you can add additional paths if you
          haven't disabled this function.  The standard breakpoint is
          the first command in the program.  Sometimes this is
          inconvenient, and you may want to set a different start
          breakpoint for example to jump over the CStartup code or to
          set it tn an important program position.

        @{b}*@{ub} Creates further Tasks

          In this case you should be sure how you want to catch the next
          Task. You could catch the Task by @{b}Next Task@{ub} or compile the
          program with an @{b}illegal@{ub} in the task and catch it with @{b}Crashed
          Task@{ub}.  After you caught the task you probably would like to
          use see symbols and debug source.  These informations can be
          loaded afterwards by using @{b}Load Symbols@{ub}.

   @{b}*@{ub} Program from the WB

     In this case you should use @{b}Next Task@{ub} and then catch the task @{b}WBL@{ub}.
     Afterwards you have to activate @{b}Next Task@{ub} again and run @{b}WBL@{ub}. You
     could also use the @{b}illegal@{ub} strategy.  After the right task was
     caught you can load the symbols again.

   @{b}*@{ub} Is it a Handler, Filesystem or something similar.

     In this case you should use the @{b}illegal@{ub} strategy and catch the
     task by @{b}Crashed Task@{ub}.  An alternative method would be to catch the
     waiting task with @{b}Debug Task@{ub} and wait as long as the task gets
     woken up by a signal.

   After you've taken the first hurdles in taking control over the task,
you should think about how the problem looks like and where it could be
located.

   Problem Type:

   @{b}*@{ub} Enforcer/CyberGuard

     If an Enforcer or CyberGuard hit is caused, these programs output
     the hit's program address and most of the time the hunk offset as
     well.  You can now directly jump to the address by entering the
     address in the DissWindow by @{b}Change Address@{ub} or you open a
     HunkWindow, doubleclick on the hunk where the hit is located and
     then enter the offset returned by Enforcer or CyberGuard.  The
     Debugger itself can also automaticlly stop a debugged program if a
     hit happens.

   @{b}*@{ub} Mungwall

     These hits aren't as easy to find as Enforcer or CyberGuard hits
     because Mungwall hits aren't shown when the problem happened but
     only after a @{b}FreeMem@{ub}.  In this case you should remember the
     memoryblock where it happened and determine where the responsible
     AllocMem is located in the program, so you get an overview in what
     area the problem is caused.  Now you should open a MemWindow that
     points to this certain memory area and step through the program
     and look if something changes the mungwall borders in the
     MemWindow.  Mungwall borders are before and after the allocated
     memory area.  If you're more experienced you could also use the
     WatchpointWindow and set a watchpoint on the certain memory block.

   @{b}*@{ub} Crash

     If it's just an ordinary crash the error should be pretty easy to
     find by single stepping through the responsible code area.  If
     it's a random crash you should try @{b}Crashed Task@{ub} and hope that the
     task can be caught.  After the task got caught you should check
     the instructions that caused the crash. If the PC points to data
     fields that don't look like real code the PC is probably set wrong
     by a stack cleanup error.  In this case you should check if the
     next addresses on the stack point to legal program code.

   @{b}*@{ub} Side effects and mysterious bugs

     These bugs are the worst to find and there's no general strategy
     how to find them. In such cases only intuition and patience can
     help.

Problems that can happen
------------------------

   @{b}*@{ub} Why does the Debugger react so slow on keyboard commands that
     control the tracing ?

     This happens if you debug a task with a higher priority than the
     Debugger's priority.  For example. DOS-Handler.  Workaround is to
     increase the priority of the Debugger.

   @{b}*@{ub} Why do filerequesters block the Debugger.

     This happens when you debug a handler, because the filerequester
     normally tests every handler with a IsFilesystem(). When you debug
     a handler it can't reply the IsFilesystem packet and therefore the
     filerequester is busy.

   @{b}*@{ub} If you debug the following program on a 68040 with 68040.library
     or 68060.library the instruction @{b}rts@{ub} is run if you cause a
     Single-Step on the instruction @{b}fetox@{ub}.  Because this command isn't
     implemented in the 68040 and 68060 it has to be emulated. It seems
     to forget the tracebit.

          	mc68040
          	fmove.x	#1.3,fp0
          	fmove.x	#255,fp1
          	fetox.x	fp0,fp1
          	rts

   @{b}*@{ub} If a program doesn't return from a DOS function, check whether you
     accidently entered a char in shell window.

The Assembler
*************

   The assembler understands the commands and addressmodes from the
68000 through the 68060 and both the Floating-Point Units, 68881 and
68882.  It supports only the 68851 MMU commands, which are also
supported by the 68030.  Since the new V2.0 it also supports from
PPC601 to PPC620.  The assembler achieves it's speed by translating the
source in a single pass, followed by a backpatch phase which corrects
all unresolved references.

Syntax
======

Comments
--------

   A comment can start in several different ways.  In a pure comment it
starts either with a ; or *.  A comment can only be started after an
assembler command or symbol with a ; if an assembler command or symbol
exists within that line.

     	;A comment
     *A comment
     	move.l a0,a0	;A comment

Opcode/Instructions arrangement
-------------------------------

   @{b}[label[:]] [opcode] [operand[, operand[, operand...]]]]]@{ub}

   @{b}*@{ub} Opcodes

     An Opcode can be a Motorola Mnemonic, an assembler command, or a
     Macro call.

   @{b}*@{ub} Operations

     In a Motorola mnemonic operands are based on legal addressmoes; in
     assembler privat instructions the parameters depend on the
     instruction.

Symbol structure
----------------

   A symbol can represent the following types:

   @{b}*@{ub} Value

   @{b}*@{ub} Program Counter

   @{b}*@{ub} Register

   @{b}*@{ub} Register List

   @{b}*@{ub} Macro

   Symbols can only be defined once. The exceptions are local labels
and symbols defined by Set.

                     Structure rules for Symbols.

   @{b}*@{ub} The first letter of a symbol can be one of the following: a...z,
     A...Z,_, @,. and \.

   @{b}*@{ub} From the second letter on, the symbol can contain the following
     letters: a...z, A...Z, 0...9, _,@ and ..

   @{b}*@{ub} If a symbol consists of only numbers and ends with $, then it is a
     numerical local label.

   @{b}*@{ub} A symbol is ended by an illegal letter.

   @{b}*@{ub} If a symbol begins with a . or \, then it is a local label.

   @{b}*@{ub} A macro symbol should not contain a ..

   @{b}*@{ub} To avoid a conflict, a symbol should not end with .b, .w or .l.


     ThisIsALabel              ;That is a normal label
     ThisIsALabel1.loop:       ;That is a normal label
     This@_Is_@A_@Label
     1$:                       ;That is a numerical local label
     .ThisIsALabel             ;That is a local label
     .ThisIsALael1:            ;That is a local label
     \ThisIsALabel.loop:       ;That is a local label
     ThisIsASymbol=10
     ThisIsASymbol = 10
     ThisIsASymbol equ 10

The relative label
------------------

   This symbol represents an offset to the start of a program.


     label
     label:
     label	nop
     label: nop

The local Label
---------------

   A local label is only valid between two normal relative labels, thus
you cannot reference local labels outside of that scope.  Otherwise it
works similar as a normal label.  There are 2 different prefixes that
introduce a local label: . and \ that define 2 different local labels.
A special case is the Backward Reference Label that is introduced with
... It doesn't depend on a certain define area between normal labels
thus you can only access the symbol if it were defined earlier.


     ..:
     label_0:
     .local:
      bra.s .local
     label_1:
     .local:
      bra.s \local
     \local:
      nop
     label_end:
     ..:
      dbra d0,..
     ..:
      dbra d1,..
     ..Hello:
      dbra d1,..Hello

The local numerical label
-------------------------

   Addionally to the non-numerical local label there are also the
numerical labels which are based of 4 digits with the postfix $.  BASM
handles the number as a hash key with the consequence that there's no
difference between 001$ and 1$.



     label_0:
     123$:	nop
     label_1:
     123$:	nop

The absolute Symbol
-------------------

   The absolute symbol is defined by a direct value initializing that
is initiated by =, equ or set.  If you define a symbol by set you can
change it as often as needed.



     value1=2
     value2 equ value1*2
     value3 set value2

The 68k Register Symbol
-----------------------

   The register symbol is defined by @{b}equr@{ub} or @{b}fequr@{ub} that is used for FPU
registers.



     Ptr	equr	a1
     PI	fequr	fp2
      move.l   (Ptr),d0   ;move.l  (a1),d0
      fmove.x  PI,fp0     ;fmove.x fp2,fp0

The PPC Register Symbol
-----------------------

   The register symbol is defined by @{b}equrp@{ub} or @{b}fequrp@{ub} that is used for
FPU registers.



     Ptr	equrp	3
     PI	fequrp	4
     	lwz	0,0(Ptr)
     	fadd	0,4,PI

The 68k Register List Symbol
----------------------------

   The register list symbol is defined by @{b}reg@{ub} and represents the
register mask for @{b}Movem@{ub} and @{b}fmovem@{ub}.  You must not mix FPU and Integer
registers with each other in a register list.


     mask	reg	d0/d2/d4-d7/a0-a4/a6-a7
     mask1	reg	d0-a6
     mask2	reg	d0-6
     fmask	reg	fp0-fp2/fp4-fp5

The Macro Symbol
----------------

   By using the command @{b}macro@{ub} or @{b}cmacro@{ub} after the symbol, the symbol is
defined as a macro.  The macro block is terminated by the command endm.
The Macro cmacro is case-insensitive and therefore useful to emulate
commands that are missing from the core.




     Symbol[:] macro
     .
     .
     Symbol[:] endm

Datatypes
---------

   The assembler understands 3 distinct datatypes.

   @{b}*@{ub} 32Bit Integer

   @{b}*@{ub} 96Bit Extended Floating Point

   @{b}*@{ub} 96Bit Packed Binary Floating Point

   At the moment only integer datatypes are supported in arithmetic
arguments so you can only use the FPU datatypes as constants.

     +-------------+--------------------+
     | Format      | Representation     |
     +-------------+--------------------+
     +-------------+--------------------+
     | Decimal     | 1024               |
     +-------------+--------------------+
     | Hexadecimal | $400               |
     +-------------+--------------------+
     | Binary      | %10000000000       |
     +-------------+--------------------+
     | Ascii       | "OK", 'OK' or `OK` |
     +-------------+--------------------+

   Furthermore you can use symbols or the character `*' that represents
the program counter in arguments.  There are limitation in the use of
symbols in arguments.  For example you can only add or subtract
constants from an external label, Floatingpoint Values can only be used
as simple constants,...  By the postfix `k' after decimal value the
value is multply by $1000.

                    @{b}Floating Point Format@{ub}

     +-------------+-------------------------------------+
     | Format      | Representation                      |
     +-------------+-------------------------------------+
     +-------------+-------------------------------------+
     | Extended    | '[+,-]3. 145637848298628[e[+,-]123] |
     +-------------+-------------------------------------+
     | Packed      | ''[+,-]3. 145637848298628[e[+,-]123]|
     +-------------+-------------------------------------+

Datatype Conversion
-------------------

   All commands are performed with these 3 datatypes and then converted
into the required datatype.  For example a 32Bit integer can be
converted into 16Bit and 8 Bit; an extended floating point into a
double or single floating point.  Floating point datatypes are rounded
by a convertation.  If a rouding error occurs the parser returns with
an error.

align Value
...........

   aligns the program counter to an address that can be devided by the

     The following options are allowed.

   @{b}*@{ub} FormatSyntax - %[flags][width][.limit][length]type

        @{b}*@{ub} flags - '-' deactivates left side layout.

        @{b}*@{ub} width - Field Length. If the first char is '0' the field is
          filled by '0' on the left side.

        @{b}*@{ub} limit - defines the maximal count of char that can be inserted
          from a string. Only legal for %s and %b.

        @{b}*@{ub} length - The size of the datatype. Default is 16-bit for the
          typs %d,%u and %x. %l is long (32Bit). Attention! The
          Assembler always pushes a longword on the stack so always use
          %l if you don't know what you're doing.

        @{b}*@{ub} type - The following types are supported.

          b - BSTR, a 32-bit BPTR Pointer on a bytelength     string.
            A NULL BPTR is handled like an empty string.  d - signed
          decimal u - unsigned decimal x - hexadezimal in lower case.
          X - hexadecimal in upper case.  s - String, a 32-bit Pointer
          on a     NULL-terminated Byte-String.      A NULL BPTR is
          handled like an empty string.  c - Char

   @{b}*@{ub} Value - is an argument that has to be resolvable.

incdir Dir[,Dir[,...]]
......................

   adds directories to the include path list.  BASM uses 2 internal
path lists and the current directory to find the include and incbin
files.  First BASM checks for a : character in the filename and if it
finds a volume the file is loaded direct instead of searching it
through the pathlists.  The first path list contains the paths that
were defined in the commandline or @{"BOPT" Link "MI_BOPT"} by the option -i or through
incdir.  The second path list contains the paths that were defined in
global configuration file ENV:BASMOption.  The entries of the second
list will be removed when the assembler is closed so that the paths are
still correct in ARexx-Mode.  The first list is removed every pass.

@{b}sa[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates writing all symbols to a symbol hunk.
     Default is off.

@{b}sd[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates writing a BASM custom format Debug Hunk.
     Makes only sense as a program file and it needs a lot hd space
     because it includes all sources. Default is off.

@{b}s1[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates writing a SAS D1 compatible Debug Hunk.
     Default is off.

@{b}sf[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates writing the full sourcefile path into the
     debug hunk.  You should only use this for your own development
     system because other users may have different HD layouts. This
     option has only a meaning with in a SAS D1 Debug Hunk. Default is
     off.

@{b}j[+,-]@{ub}

     For object files it adds the suffix @{b}.o@{ub}.

@{b}P<Priority>@{ub}
     sets the task priority.

@{b}c[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates that the assembler interpretes Upper and
     Lower case as 2 different chars.  Default is on.

@{b}f[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates a faster mode that resolves all references

     option has no effect during optimizing.  Default is off.

@{b}F[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates a faster IO mode that keeps include paths as
     locks instead of strings.  The older basm versions used locks to
     store paths but as this isn't compatible with multi-assigns I
     changed that.

@{b}M<Bytes>@{ub}
     defines the max macro expansion size.  If you get a macromemerror
     you should increase the size. Default 1000 Bytes.

@{b}ws[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates Supervisor warnings.  Default is on.

@{b}wm[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates Move16 warnings because the use of the

     Default is on.

@{b}wp[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates pc-relative access to different section
     warnings. The linker is needed to resolve such files.  Default is
     on.

@{b}w2[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates 68020 addressmode warnings.  Default is on.

@{b}w4[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates 64k-Access warnings.  It's useful if you
     accidently avoid to forget the address register.  Example: move.l
     8,d0 instead of move.l 8(an),d0 Default is on.

@{b}b0@{ub}
     sets the Default Branch Length to 8-Bit. .b Default is off.

@{b}b1@{ub}

     optimizing will happen besides addressmode converting.  Default is
     off.

@{b}OG[+,-]@{ub}
     activates/deactivates Forward Reference Optimizing to use every
     possibility. In this mode the source is assembled until no further
     optimizing method is found.  First the source is assembled
     normally.  This is shown by the Output Pass 1.  Afterwards the
     optimize passes are started and continued until no further symbol
     changes and length errors occur.  This can take a while and
     depends on the source size. Default is off.

Assembler Macros
================

   Macros are meta commands that can be based of many assembler
instructions to achieve an abstracter source layout.  In a macro you
can use several different pattern that are replaced by appropriate
parameters when the macro is called.  The parameter that are passed
during a macro call are represented by the following patterns:
\0,...,\9, \a,...,\z, \A,...,\Z.  The pattern ids are using the
hexadecimal format.  If a pattern is used with no related parameter an
empty string is inserted.  Furthermore if a parameter contains
tabulators or spaces it has to be placed between <...>.  When a macro
needs relative labels and is should be called more than one time you
should use the special pattern @.  This pattern is replaced by a number
that is based of 4 digits and that is increased after each call.  The
pattern \# is replaced by the value of the symbol narg that represents
the count of macro parameters.  Besides the standard patterns there are
some more advanced pattern functions supported that look like
\*Function-Name.  These functions don't belong to the motorola standard
thus they aren't supported by every assembler.  Another important point
is that you can also call macros from from macros but you can't define
macros in macros.

   The standard macro pattern

   Label & [. string] & [, string] & [, string] & [,...]        & [\\0]
& [\\1|] & [\\2|] & [\\3|]...[\\n|]

   The advanced macro pattern functions

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b} \(Argument)@{ub} inserts the string of the macroparameter with the
     number the argument defines.


          \(1) =  \1
          \(1+3+4) = \8

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}\*upper(String)@{ub} inserts the string in upper case.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}\*lower(String)@{ub} inserts the string in lower case.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}\*valof(Argument)@{ub} inserts the decimal value of the argument as
     a string.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}\*strlen(Symbol)@{ub} inserts the length of a symbol as a string.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}\*right(String,n)@{ub} inserts n chars of the right side of the
     string.  If the string contains less than n chars the whole string
     is inserted.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}\*left(String,n)@{ub} inserts n chars of the left side of the
     string.  If the string contains less than n chars the whole string
     is inserted.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}\*mid(String,n,m)@{ub} inserts chars from position n to m from the
     string.  If the position is outside of the string length the chars
     till the end of the string is inserted.

Highlevel Macros
================

   In highlevel macros the operands are based of legal addressmodes.
Arguments are based of operands and the operators +,-,<<,>>. Conditions
are based of !,=, <,>,<=,>=,<>.  By using highlevel macros you can make
the programming of non critical source areas easier and more abstract.

Direct Addressmode Optimizing
-----------------------------

   The assembler can direct optimize certain 68020...60 Addressmodes if
a faster 68000 addressmode exists.  This optimizing method should
always be activated because of compatibility reasons.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}(bd.w,an)@{ub} can be optimized to @{b}x(an)@{ub} that removes 1 word and
     some cycles.

     +------------------------+--------------------+--------+

     +------------------------+--------------------+--------+

     | move. l (1000.w,an),dn | move.l 1000(an),dn |  -OC0  |
     +------------------------+--------------------+--------+

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}(bd.w,pc)@{ub} can be optimized to @{b}x(pc)@{ub} that removes 1 word and
     some cycles.

     +------------------------+--------------------+--------+

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}(bd.w)@{ub} can be optimized to @{b}bd.w@{ub} that removes 1 word and some
     cycles.

     +------------------------+--------------------+--------+

     |  move. l (bd.w),dn     |   move.l bd.w,dn   |  -OC4  |
     +------------------------+--------------------+--------+

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}(bd.l)@{ub} can be optimized to @{b}bd.l@{ub} that removes 1 word and some
     cycles.

     +------------------------+--------------------+--------+

     +------------------------+--------------------+--------+

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}(an)@{ub} can be optimized to @{b}(an)@{ub} that removes 1 word and some
     cycles.  The addressmode @{b}(an)@{ub} can be interpreted as a subgroup of
     @{b}(bd,an,xn)@{ub}. Because @{b}(an)@{ub} is a normal 68000 addressmode you should
     never switch off this optimizing method.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}(pc)@{ub} can be optimized to @{b}(pc)@{ub} that removes 1 word and some
     cycles.  The addressmode @{b}(pc)@{ub} can be interpreted as a subgroup of
     @{b}(bd,pc,xn)@{ub}. Because @{b}(pc)@{ub} is a normal 68000 addressmode you should
     never switch off this optimizing method.

How does Optimizing work ?
--------------------------

   In single-pass Optimizing the assembler can only optimize commands
where it can resolve the reference in the first pass.  This means the
label or symbol has to be known before.  In multi-pass Optimizing it
can optimize every command without bothering where the label is defined.
The Assembler keeps all labels each pass but increases a change counter
if the old contents differs with the new contents.  The exception is
that the assembler can't optimize commands that depend on symbols that
are defined after the command.  The reason is that the Assembler has to
remove each pass every symbol to avoid problems with @{b}IFD@{ub} and @{b}IFND@{ub} that
can cause that certain areas aren't assembled in multi-pass mode.  You
probably noticed that i assume that nobody used @{b}IFD@{ub} or @{b}IFND@{ub} with labels
because that would also break multi-pass.

   An example for a construct that can't be optimized.

Problems...
-----------

   You should always be careful with optimizing because it can cause
bugs in certain source areas.  Branch optimizing for example has to be
switched off if you use JMP-Towers.


          lsl.w #1,d0
          jmp   Tower(pc,d0.w)
     
      Tower:
          bra.w func1
          bra.w func2
          bra.w func3
     
      could be be optimized to
     
      Tower:
          bra.w func1
          bra.s func2
          bra.s func3
     
      that leads to program bugs.
     
      Solution:
     
      bopt OD6-
     
      Tower:
          bra.w func1
          bra.w func2
          bra.w func3

Preassembled Includes
=====================

   If you want to assemble a program that needs to load a lot includes
it's useful to preassemble the includes and load one file because  the
real slowdown factor is the need loading time.   You can only use
absolut symbols and macros in a preassembled file.   All relative and
symbols defined by @{b}set@{ub} aren't written into  a preassembled file.   The
created file isn't compress to avoid any slowdown but if  the file size
is critical you can compress the file by xpk and  load it through the
xfh filesystem.

     basm -p Source.S creates the preassembled file Source.p


     An error location could be absolut symbols that are calculated  by
     relative symbols. You should avoid these symbols.

     Symbol=Label1-Label2


Resident includes
=================

   @{b}BASM@{ub} can control an Include and Incbin database by the library
@{b}cachefile.library@{ub} to get rid of the loading delays.  The files in the
database can be shown and deleted.

   @{b}Format:@{ub}

     BASM [-Option] Name


   This is the commandline version of the assembler and can be easy
integrated in own development system, for example @{b}Make@{ub} and @{b}CED@{ub}.  An
assembler error is indicated by the result 20 and the result 10 is used
if no source file were specified.

   @{b}*@{ub}     @{b}Option@{ub}

     The same options are accepted that are described in the assembler
     command @{"BOPT" Link "MI_BOPT"}.  The following options are accepted additionally.

        @{b}*@{ub} A[+,-] Turns ARexx mode on/off

        @{b}*@{ub} C <Configuration> loads a configuration file

        @{b}*@{ub} d <Symbol=Value> defines a symbol

Configuration
-------------

Global
......

   You can define the global configuration through the file
@{b}ENV:BASMOption@{ub}. The internal standard configuration  is not replaced
but can only be changed.

   File @{b}ENV:BASMOption@{ub}


      -v
      -f
      -c-
      -iASM:

     If a line doesn't start with - it's ignored.


WB Tooltypes
............

   Additionally you can also define the above described configuration
options in the tooltypes of the source file icon.   Furthermore @{b}BASM@{ub}
allows a special tooltype to define  an output window.

   o Window= <Window Defintion>

ARexx
=====

   The @{b}BASM@{ub} ARexx Port Name is @{b}rexx_BASM@{ub} and the  ARexx Script suffix
@{b}.basm@{ub}.   To activate the @{b}BASM@{ub} ARexx mode you have to start  @{b}BASM@{ub} with
the option -A.

BASM
....

   @{b}BASM [-Option] Name@{ub}

   This ARexx command starts the assembler and coincides with the
CLI-syntax structure.

BEND
....

   @{b}BEND@{ub}

   This ARexx command closes the ARexx port and shuts down the
assembler.

BGETERROR
.........

   @{b}BGETERROR@{ub}

   With this ARexx command you will receive an explanation of the actual
errors. If no errors exist it will return a status code 20.

   Error Format String

   OFFSET|FILE|<Error Description>

BNEXTERROR
..........

   @{b}BNEXTERROR@{ub}

   This ARexx command will cause a jump to the next error in the list.
If there are no further errors in the list it will return a status
code 20.

BINITERROR
..........

   @{b}BINITERROR@{ub}

   This ARexx command will cause a jump to the first entry in the error
list. If no error exists it will return a status code 20.

BGETWARNING
...........

   @{b}BGETWARNING@{ub}

   works like @{b}BGETERROR@{ub} only for Warnings.

BNEXTWARNING
............

   @{b}BNEXTWARNING@{ub}

   works like @{b}BNEXTERROR@{ub} only for Warnings.

BINITWARNING
............

   @{b}BINITWARNING@{ub}

   works like @{b}BINITERROR@{ub} only for Warnings.

Compatibility
=============

to other assemblers...
----------------------


     Unfortunately @{b}BASM@{ub} can't be 100% compatible to every assembler on
     the amiga market.  Thus you can expect problems with different
     sources.  In general you can expect problems with commands that
     don't belong to a standard like option commands.  Furthermore you
     should also be careful with sources that directly depend on the
     assembler implementation.  Because @{b}BASM@{ub} is a 1-Pass Assembler in
     the normal mode with an additional backpatch phase you shouldn't
     define symbols that can't be resolved at once.  An ideal example
     for this practice is the @{b}Xoper2.2@{ub} Source that was developed with
     the PD Assembler A68k.  While assembling with @{b}BASM@{ub} the assembler
     detects that a not defined symbols is accessed through the @{b}SET@{ub}
     command.  Generally this should cause an error at once but
     unfortunately @{b}A68k@{ub} doesn't show anything and uses the last value of
     @{b}cmdnum@{ub}.

          	    ADDCMD  'pri'
          	    ADDCMD  'flush'

     Because the A68k is a 2-Pass Assembler he can assemble this Source
     without problems.


     Another Problem is that the assembler argument parser doesn't
     detect Overflow because of speed reasons. I don't think it's worth
     it...if you differ tell me your opinion.


     The assembler doesn't support the following motorola syntax bugs
     because of the internal structure of the parser it would cause
     major problems in the multi-pass mode.


          symbol: equ 0
          symbol: equr d0

C-Compiler Assembler
--------------------

Dice
....

   If you use Basm as a @{b}DASM@{ub} replacement you have to run @{b}Basm@{ub} with the
option -OAS to activate the Smalldata mode.  If you want to emulate the
advanced @{b}Link@{ub}, @{b}UnLink@{ub}, @{b}Movem@{ub} optimizing @{b}DASM@{ub} supports you have to use
the options -O, -OG, -ODh, -ODi and -ODj.  The option -OG is needed
because the link stackframe register list symbols are defined after the
commands so the assembler doesn't know them in 1 pass mode.  Sorry...i
had to disable this mode because i later detected that i have to keep
track of the used registers.  I'll try to fix this in a later version

Addressmode Examples
====================

   To avoid some problems here are some small examples how addressmode
have to build up.


     x=$40
     y=$400
       move.b (x,A0,D2.W),D0
       move.b x(A0,D2.W),D0
     
     ;Both lines are correct
     ;(x,a0,d2.w) is optimized internal to (x,a0,d2.w).
     ;For more information please check the chapter about
     ;Optimizing Direct Addressmodes.
     
       move.b (y,A0,D2.W),D0
       move.b y(A0,D2.W),D0
     
     ;Now you get 2 errors, because y is not an 8bit word.
     ;These 2 lines shows the correct version.
     
       move.b (y.w,A0,D2.W),D0
       move.b (y.w,A0,D2.W),D0
     
     ;or
     
       move.b (y.l,A0,D2.W),D0
       move.b (y.l,A0,D2.W),D0
