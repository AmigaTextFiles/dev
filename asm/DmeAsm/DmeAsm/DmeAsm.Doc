		DmeAsm   by Nic Wilson


This program is for anyone who uses the HighSoft Devpac Assembler
and would like to use the fantastic editor DME.  The only draw back
I found was actully assembling was a pain.

(see below for use within DME)

Enter DmeAsm.  DmeAsm is a CLI command file that takes your source 
code as a parameter and opens a window similar to the Assemble window
inside Devpac (Genam2) and gives similar options.  These options are
very straight forward for anyone who uses Devpac.  If no parameter is
supplied then the window will still open and you can supply your own.

Once launched the source file will be showing in the Source String gadget
and the default save filename (source less all after the . ) in the
destination gadget.  These can be changed if you wish.  The StdOut gadget
is so you can supply a file to save the output from Genim2 to. 

At the bottom is a set of six gadgets as below.

Asm/Debug	-	assemble then launch metascope with the executable
Metascope	-	launch metascope immediately
Asm/Run		-	Assemble then execute the file
Cancel		-	exit out
Run		-	run the file
Assemble  	-	just assemble it

This program can be used from within DME as the Author kindly supplied
DME with a $filename option.  To use it is simple, just make a small change
to the DME .edrc file to add a menu option.  With this file you will find
an example .edrc file (the one I use).  Down the bottom you will see
the Assemble entry.  This launches DmeAsm when the menu option is selected
using the file in the current window.

Any probs then please write to me, I have enclosed the source code for
your enjoyment.
