LEFT MOUSE QUITS IF YOU ARE LUCKY

Here is a collection of programs i wrote in my old 1.2 kickstart days
They have all been tried on the A1200 but some of them need to be
degraded (using TUDE or whatever) before they run correctly.
Some of them may even crash your system.
Definately some of them STEAL memory, so make sure that you have
nothing running in the background before you try them

Sadly i have not got any source for these little gems (maybe thats a good thing)
They are purely for my own reminiscence of the good old days
when all my buddies would pack up their amigas and pile around my place
for a good old sesh with too much beer and food.  We would code
hack, crack and generally enjoy all that the amiga had to offer.
Still here you are.
