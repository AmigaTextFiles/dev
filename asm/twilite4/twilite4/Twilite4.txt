This is another one of my programs that isnt finished.
It works pretty well, although its screaming for keyboard controls.
It can load and save in umpteen different formats, all of which ive
needed at some time or another. It can now load iff 
thanks to the iff library.

This is the editor we use for all of our character map proggies.
Most of the buttons work.  Its quite straight forward to use.
As i say it was just supposed to be for our own use so its not
polished in anyway.  It does however work properly.

This is the program that I really got used to programming the amiga
in a system friendly manner (no more supervisor mode for me)
and the routines im most chuffed with are the disk routines.
