@NODE Using

Using this program is extremely easy.

    By selecting the  library you wish to consult, you will be presented
    with a list of its functions. Just clic on the one you're interested
    in, and a requester containing the following information will appear

		- the function's name
		- a short summary of what it does
		- its offset
		- the structures and registers it uses

    Naturally enough, the information provided is not comprehensive; OFL
    is no  replacement to the autodocs . Its main aim is  to provide you
    with  the minimum information needed  and spare you hours of tedious
    research through  tons of documentation . For more details, you will
    have to go through the autodocs or the Rom Kernal Reference Manuals.

    You may iconify and quit the program using the menu or the keyboard
    short-cuts.
