                            ProAsm is Shareware



Welcome to the shareware release of ProAsm 1.92.


If you one of those people that never read a manual until they get into
trouble read this file. I can relate! This readme file gives you a quick
overview of the ProAsm Developement System, for a more detailed overview
refer to the readme_more.txt file.


** Version 1.92 of the ProAsm Developement Package removes all bugs found **
** in the last release.                                                   **



ProAsm Package consists of...
-------------------------------
    - ProAsm          : a powerful assembler,
    - ASX             : the ProAsm user interface,
    - ProOpts         : the ProAsm configuration program,
    - Routine Files   : large source code library,
    - large AmigaGuide documentation,
    - example source codes,
    - and many additional utilities.



Routine Files
-------------------------------
Routine  files  build a powerful source code library of useful routines that
provide a simple and time saving method for assembly programming.



Shareware
-------------------------------
Quite all crippling had been removed since the last time to give you a
better chance to try the program out.  Refer to the manual or the
registration.doc for more detailed information.



Documentation
-------------------------------
You find the complete online documentation in the Help/ and the Help/english/
directory of this distribution.

A printed version of the manual with about 320 pages is available in form
of a postscript document that is distributed as a second archive that comes
along with the ProAsm distribution (proasm192_man.lha)



New Users
-------------------------------
New users should read the readme_more.txt file to get a complete overview of
the ProAsm package.
