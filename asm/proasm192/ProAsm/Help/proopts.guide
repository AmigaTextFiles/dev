@Node "About This Manual"

About This Manual
=================


    Welcome to the AmigaGuide version of the ProOpts manual.


    This manual is a part of the ProAsm manual, which was originally written
in TeX and texinfo. You are currently looking at the AmigaGuide version of
the ProOpts part. I used various tools to convert the primal TeX source into
AmigaGuide. They did quite a good job, but the result was over 700KBytes of
length! As a consequence I had to shorten the whole guide file by hand. Now
it is very possible that when browsing through this manual you will find
sentences like:

          @{i}This node (page) intentionally left blank.@{ui}
or
          @{i}This node (page) was intentionally shortened.@{ui}

Please forgive me for that. I had also to skip various tables that can
be found in the original printed manual.

    Caused by the convertion of the TeX source of the manual into this
AmigaGuide file and the need of some small reorganisation of it, some of
the links go nowhere. Sorry for that, but I had not the time to check all
links. I did check a lot of them, but unfortunately there are still some of
these dead links in the guide file. If you should find any, please feel
free to inform me (@{"Daniel Weber" link "Author"}).

    If you find some strange (unusal) parts in this AmigaGuide file, please
keep in mind, that this guide initially was written as a book. You can
order a copy of the printed manual, if you wish. Please read the
registration document (register.doc or @{"Registration" link "pro.guide/Registration"}) for
further information.

The original manual mentioned above is distributed as a postscript file
in the proasm180_ps.lha archive. It has approximately 322 pages, many tables,
and much much more. The TeX source will be distributed some time later.

System Requirements
===================

    ProOpts requires Kickstart and Workbench 2.0 or higher.

@Node "Introduction"

ProOpts - The ProAsm Configuration Program
==========================================

    ProOpts  provides a simple method of generating or changing a
configuration file  for  the ProAsm assembler.  Since ProAsm supports
configuration files to  be  loaded each time when it is called, the
user is able to customize ProAsm  to suit his particular wishes and
needs.  The options for a project can  be set by clicking on the gadget
that corresponds to the option.  Even options  for  which  the  ProOpts
utility  does  not  have a gadget can be specified by a special string
and listview gadget.

    The  generated  configuration  file  is  an  ASCII  file  that
contains the specified options as assembly directives.  It is similar
to an include file except  that it is loaded at the very beginning of
each assembly.  There is no  restriction  on  the  use  of  assembler
directives or even code in the configuration  file.   The  user  can
also  re-edit or add options using a texteditor.   Previously
generated config files can be loaded into ProOpts and then be changed
to the new option settings.

@Node "Running ProOpts"

Running ProOpts
---------------

    To run ProOpts, you can either double-click on its icon, or enter
@{b}ProOpts@{ub} on the shell command line.  ProOpts requires Kickstart and
Workbench 2.0 or higher to run.  There is no need to use the AmigaDOS
@{b}Run@{ub} command to start ProOpts since it will automatically self-detach
from the shell or CLI that it was started from.

@EndNode

@Node "Using ProOpts"

Using ProOpts
-------------

    If started successfully, ProOpts opens the ProOpts Index window
(shown above).  This window contains seven gadgets that open additional
windows.  Each of these windows allows you to set options sorted after
their main topic.  The seven windows are:

@{b}Assembler Options@{ub}
@{b}Code Options@{ub}
@{b}Default Options@{ub}
@{b}Miscellaneous Options@{ub}
@{b}Optimization Options@{ub}
@{b}List Options@{ub}
@{b}Linker Options@{ub}


    In addition to these topic gadgets that represent these seven
windows, three cycle gadgets can be found:

@{b}No Optimize@{ub}
@{b}Optimize@{ub}
     Disables respectively enables the selected optimizations.  By
     default, the optimizations are turned off.


@{b}No List@{ub}
@{b}List@{ub}
     Disables or enables the listing generation.  By default, the
     listing is disabled.


@{b}Executable@{ub}
@{b}Linkable@{ub}
@{b}Binary@{ub}
@{b}Preasm@{ub}
@{b}S-record@{ub}
@{b}No Object@{ub}
     With this cycle gadget, the type of the output file can be
     selected.  By default, the assembler creates an executable object
     file.


    Three other action-gadgets can be found in the bottom row, that
control ProOpts:

@{b}Save@{ub}
     Stores the current settings to @{b}ENVARC:proasm.config@{ub} and
     @{b}ENV:proasm.config@{ub}.

@{b}Save as@{ub}
     Save the current settings to a user specified file.  After
     selecting this gadget, a file requester is opened that allows you
     to specify the name of the file the configuration is written to.
     The file requester will always appear with this command, whereas
     the @{b}Save@{ub} command will assume the predefined names.
@{b}Cancel@{ub}
     Simply quits ProOpts.


    ProOpts has also a menu, the same for all the different windows.
The following menu items can be found:

@{b}Open...@{ub}
     The @{b}Open...@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-O@{ub}) command allows you to load an existing
     configuration file using a file requester.  ProOpts updates all
     gadgets according to the new loaded configuration file.  All lines
     that could not be recognized by ProOpts are added to the `Custom
     Lines' in the assembler options window (see @{"Assembler Options" Link "Assembler Options"}).

@{b}Save@{ub}
     The @{b}Save@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-S@{ub}) command stores the current settings to
     @{b}ENVARC:proasm.config@{ub} and @{b}ENV:proasm.config@{ub}.

@{b}Save as...@{ub}
     The @{b}Save as...@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-A@{ub}) command is very similar to the @{b}Save@{ub}
     command.  It allows you to store the current settings to a user
     specified file.  A file requester is opened that allows you to
     specify the name of the file the configuration is written to.  The
     file requester will always appear with this command, whereas the
     @{b}Save@{ub} command will assume the predefined names.

@{b}About@{ub}
     The @{b}About@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-?@{ub}) selection displays the copyright and version
     notice for ProOpts.

@{b}Quit@{ub}
     The @{b}Quit@{ub} (@{b}AMIGA-Q@{ub}) command quits ProOpts.

@{b}Reset To Defaults@{ub}
     This command (@{b}AMIGA-D@{ub}) resets all settings to their default.



Types of Gadgets used
---------------------

    When using ProOpts, you may encounter one or more of the following
basic types of gadgets:
@{b}action@{ub}
     Action-gadgets appear as raised buttons.  Normally the buttons are
     labeled with a small text that is written inside the gadget.
     Selecting such a button causes an immediate action.  For example,
     the @{b}Cancel@{ub} gadget in the main window causes ProOpts to quit.

@{b}cycle@{ub}
     Cycle-gadgets look quite similar to action-gadgets, except that a
     small symbol of a curled arrow that points to itself is on the
     left side.  By selection the gadget you can cycle through the
     available settings for that specific option.  The cycle direction
     can be reversed by pressing the @{b}SHIFT@{ub} key as you click the left
     mouse button.

@{b}list@{ub}
@{b}listview@{ub}
     Generally list-gadgets appear as a set of control gadgets.  A
     small scrollbar, arrow gadgets, and a string area.  ProOpts has
     additional control gadgets attached to its list-gadgets.  These
     gadgets are a string-gadget, an add-gadget (in one case),
     del-gadget, top-, up-, down-, and a bottom-gadget.  Use the scroll
     bar and the arrow gadgets to position the scrolling area to a
     specific entry.  To add new entries to the list, select the
     add-gadget (if available) or type the new entry name into the
     string-gadget (below the scroll area) and press RETURN.  Entries
     can be removed from the list, by selecting the entry to be cleared
     in the scroll area (to copy its name into the string-gadget), and
     selecting the del-gadget.

     The top-, up-, down-, and a bottom-gadget can be used to move the
     entry to the desired position in the list.  Top and bottom move
     the item directly to either the top end or the bottom end of the
     list. Up and down move the selected item one position upwards or
     downwards in the list.  Some gadgets can be disabled if they
     cannot be used (e.g. on empty lists).

@{b}string@{ub}
     String-gadgets appear as raised ridge around a text area.  Any
     string can be entered by clicking (activating) within the text area
     and typing your string.  When you have finished typing, press the
     RETURN key to confirm or the TAB key to confirm and jump to the
     next string-gadget.

@{b}integer@{ub}
     Integer-gadgets are in function and look identical to the
     string-gadgets.  But they accept only decimal integer numbers as
     input.

@{b}check@{ub}
     Check-gadgets appear as small rectangular raised buttons, labeled
     with a text on the left or the right side of the gadget.  When the
     gadget is selected, a small checkmark appears, or disappears when
     unselected.

    The rest of this section describes all the different windows that
ProOpts offers to set and change the assembler options.  Everything in
these windows should be fairly self-explanatory.  The individual
options are not described to their last details, since they all can be
found somewhere else in this manual.  The discussed options carry
references that leads you to their descriptions in this manual.  The
saved configuration file will be used the next time ProAsm is run.

@Node "Assembler Options" "pro.guide/Assembler Options"

Assembler Options
.................

@{b}Include Directories@{ub}
     Include search pathes tell the assembler where to look for files
     to be included by the @{b}INCLUDE@{ub} or @{b}INCBIN@{ub} directives, or their
     synonyms.  A new path can be added by either selecting the @{b}Add@{ub}
     gadget that opens a file requester to select the directory, or its
     name can be typed into the string-gadget.  You do not have to
     enclose the path name in double or single quotes if it contains
     one or more whitespaces.  ProOpts encloses automatically all
     entries with double quotes if needed.

     When the settings are stored, these include directories are all
     written as arguments of the @{b}INCDIR@{ub} directive to the configuration
     file.  See @{"INCDIR" Link "pro.guide/INCDIR"}.

@{b}Custom Lines@{ub}
     When a configuration file is loaded at startup or via the @{b}Open...@{ub}
     menu item, all lines that could not be recognized by ProOpts are
     put in this list.  See @{"ProOpts Directives Summary" Link "ProOpts Directives Summary"}, for a list of
     all valid directives.

     The custom lines list can also be used to add directives to the
     configuration file that are not supported by ProOpts.  You may
     even put complete macro definitions into the list.  Awkward, but
     it works.

@{b}No XPK Support@{ub}
     This check-gadget controls the XPK support.  XPK support is
     disabled when the gadget is set.  See @{"OPT NOXPK" Link "pro.guide/OPT XPK"}.

@{b}Assembly Priority@{ub}
     Using the integer-gadget you have the possibility to set the task
     priority of the assembler while running (see @{"ASMPRI" Link "pro.guide/ASMPRI"}).

     Note that ProOpts does not check the range of the entered value to
     its validity.  The range of the priority are the integers from
     -128 to 127.  The CLI and the most other tasks have a priority of
     0, and it is suggested that you do not set the priority higher
     than 10.  A priority higher than zero means that the assembler
     will not be slowed down as much by other tasks.  Setting the
     priority lower than 0 will prevent ProAsm from slowing down other
     programs with normal priority.

@{b}Symbol Search@{ub}
     With this cycle-gadget you can select an appropriate symbol search
     algorithm for your source codes.  You can choose between @{b}Standard@{ub}
     (default), @{b}ESS1@{ub}, @{b}ESS2@{ub}, and @{b}ESS3@{ub}.  See @{"OPT ESS1" Link "pro.guide/OPT ESS1"}, for more details.


@EndNode

@Node "Code Options" "pro.guide/Code Options"

Code Options
............

@{b}CPU@{ub}
     This cycle-gadget specifies the processor to be programmed for.
     See @{"Processor Type" Link "Processor Type"}, for more information.

     Note that the cycle-gadget entry @{b}Any@{ub} represents the @{b}MCRELAX@{ub}
     directive.

@{b}FPU@{ub}
     This cycle-gadget allows you to specify the floating-point
     coprocessor you want to program for to allow its instruction set.
     See @{"MC68881" Link "pro.guide/MC68000"}, for more details.

     Note that the MC68040 and MC68060 processor have built-in FPU.
     Their FPU instruction sets are automatically allowed when the
     specific processor is selected (see the @{b}CPU@{ub} gadget above).

@{b}MMU@{ub}
     This cycle-gadget only toggles between @{b}None@{ub}, for no MMU, and
     @{b}MC68851@{ub}.  See @{"MC68851" Link "pro.guide/MC68000"}, for more details.

     Note that the MC68030, MC68040, and MC68060 MMU instruction set
     will automatically be enabled when the specific CPU has been
     selected (see the @{b}CPU@{ub} gadget above).

@{b}Case@{ub}
     With this cycle-gadget you can toggle between case @{b}sensitive@{ub} and
     @{b}unsensitive@{ub} symbols.  See @{"OPT C" Link "pro.guide/OPT C"}, for more information.

@{b}Symbol Significance@{ub}
     Specifying a value using the integer-gadget makes the first part
     of symbol case sensitive or unsensitive, according to @{b}Case@{ub} (see
     above).  See @{"OPT C" Link "pro.guide/OPT C"}, for more information.

     Note that ProOpts does not perform a range check on the entered
     value.  Valid values must be from 0 to 256, where 0 turns the
     symbol significance off.

@{b}Underscore for Local Labels@{ub}
     If this gadget is selected, the underscore (@{b}_@{ub}) rather than the dot
     (@{b}.@{ub}) is used to introduce a local label (see @{"OPT U" Link "pro.guide/OPT U"}).

@{b}Warn not Supervisor Instructions@{ub}
     This check-gadget allows you to enable or disable all warnings on
     supervisor-only opcodes.  The warnings are disabled when the
     gadget is selected.  See @{"SUPER" Link "pro.guide/SUPER"}, for more details.

@{b}Warn not Read-Modify-Write Instr.@{ub}
     You can suppress all warnings for read/modify/write instructions
     by selecting this check-gadget.  See @{"READMODWRITE" Link "pro.guide/READMODWRITE"}.

@{b}Ensure PC-Relative Code@{ub}
     Selecting this check-gadget forces the assembler to report a
     @{b}relocation not allowed@{ub} error on any instructions that require
     relocation.  See @{"OPT P" Link "pro.guide/OPT P"}, for more information.

@{b}Immediate Data Check@{ub}
     All absolute addresses will be checked for missing pound signs (@{b}#@{ub}),
     when this check-gadget is selected (see @{"OPT I" Link "pro.guide/OPT I"}).

@{b}Automatic PC-Relative@{ub}
     In selected state this gadget forces the assembler to use the
     PC-relative addressing mode where possible instead of the absolute
     long addressing mode.  See @{"OPT AUTOPC" Link "pro.guide/Optimization"}, for more information.

@{b}Control software-supported instructions@{ub}
     These two cycle-gadgets allow you to control the use of
     software-supported instructions.

     The first cycle-gadget enables or disables the software-supported
     floating-point instructions of either the MC68040, the MC68060, or
     both processors.  The second gadget controls only the use of the
     MC68060 software-supported integer instructions.

     See @{"OPT FPSP40" Link "pro.guide/Processor Options"},and @{"OPT SP60" Link "pro.guide/Processor Options"}, for more detailed information.

@{b}Bit Number@{ub}
     Using this cycle-gadget you can decide whether a warning, no
     warning, or an error should be reported if ProAsm encounters a bit
     number that is not in bounds.  See @{"OPT CHKBIT" Link "pro.guide/OPT CHKBIT"}.

@{b}(Syntax) Model@{ub}
     This gadget can be used to determine whether the assembler should
     accept the new syntax model, the old one, or both.  See @{"NEWSYNTAX" Link "pro.guide/Syntax Options"}.


@EndNode

@Node "Default Options" "pro.guide/Default Options"

Default Options
...............

    In the default options window you have the possibility to define
the default behaviour of ProAsm.  Refer to @{"Assembly Options" Link "Assembly Options"}, for more
details on these and possible settings.  ProOpts uses the @{b}DEFAULT@{ub}
directive for all these cycle-gadgets when saved to the configuration
file.  See @{"DEFAULT" Link "pro.guide/DEFAULT"}, for information about this directive and its
arguments.  The cycle-gadgets let you specify the @{i}mode@{ui} arguments of the
@{b}DEFAULT@{ub} directive.

@{b}Default Branch Size@{ub}
     Corresponds to @{b}DEFAULT _BRANCH,@{i}mode@{ui}@{ub}.

@{b}Default Base Displacement@{ub}

     This check-gadget lets you suppress all error messages (see @{"OPT E" Link "pro.guide/OPT E"}).

@{b}Error Failat Level@{ub}
     The value in the integer-gadget specifies the maximum number of
     errors to be reported before aborting assembly.  A value of zero
     sets the limit to unlimited number of errors.  See @{"FAILAT" Link "pro.guide/FAILAT"}.

@{b}Enable Escape Strings@{ub}
     This check-gadget controls the allowance of escape sequences
     withing strings.  If it is selected, escape sequences are allowed.
     See @{"ESCAPESTR" Link "pro.guide/ESCAPESTR"}.

@{b}Enable Type Checking@{ub}
     Select this check-gadget to enable type checking.  Refer to
