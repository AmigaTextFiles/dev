Replaces: PHXGUI V1.2 Alpha for PHXASS V43.7
Version : V2.0
Distribution: Aminet


This is my 2nd Version of PHXAssGUI. It's still ALPHA because I have no tester
but it should be stable now.

For any bugs please contact me. PHXAssGUI V2.0 uses kcon for output.

kcon is available in aminet.

Have fun with this small programm
