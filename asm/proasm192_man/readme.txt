This is the postscript manual distribution of ProAsm 1.92.


Notices
-------------------------------
The postscript file is the complete user's manual of the ProAsm assembler
and all associated utilities. It contains about 320 pages and has the proud
size of 1600078 bytes.

You find a shortened version of it in the ProAsm binary distribution splitted
into four AmigaGuide files (pro.guide, asx.guide, proopts.guide, proutils.guide).

The manual was written using TeX and texinfo. The TeX document will be
included in a future distribution.


You may use PSUtils (pstops, psnup, psselect, psbook) from Angus J. C. Duggan
to reformat the manual. The utilities can be found on the Aminet
'text/print/PSUtils_v1r16.lha'.
