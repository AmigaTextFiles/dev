Earlier this year (1997) me and oj had an idea for a stradegy war game
like hack and populous. 
I got as far as the level display 
when i got diablo on the PC (now go wash your monitor!)

Anyway we quickly abandoned this idea and went started on minermadness4

use cursor keys to move around
and  f10 shows level map and F9 brings you back to the iso display.

BUGS:
	only a minor one which i would have fixed anyway,
	if you move the cursor keys while showing the map
	it displays the ISO screen but in funny colours
