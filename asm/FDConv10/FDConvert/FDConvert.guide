@node intro "FDConvert - Introduction"

FDConvert is a utility to convert standard FD files to assembler includes.
There is also a number of options you can use to customize the output a bit.
All other FD converters i've seen are CLI only with no options at all. So,
i wrote this one and i hope you like it.

@node feat "FDConvert - Features"

 o Very quick
 
 o Optionally copies comments from the FD file
 
 o Optionally writes extra info to make the comments make sense with the
   Commodore FD's
 
 o Optionally writes macros for accessing the library and the library name
 
 o Full Workbench utility
 
 o Small.. only 15K
 
 o Has a nice gui :)
 
 o And probably more i haven't thought of

@node sysreq "FDConvert - System Requirements"

FDConvert requires Workbench 2.04+ and asl.library in libs. Memory usage
is minimal and FD's are read a line at a time so even the largest FD should
convert with no trouble on a 1Mb machine.

@node use "FDConvert - Useage"

FDConvert can be run from the CLI or the Workbench. Currently, there is no
CLI interface so the GUI just opens when run from the CLI.

The GUI is split into two parts, Main and Options.

Main
----
The two string gadgets are for the filenames, top one is the FD one and the
bottom one is the filename of the file FDConvert will generate. The two
GetFile gadgets next to the string gadgets are for selecting files using a
asl file requester.

Underneath the string gadgets, you'll see a row of button gadgets. They're
all pretty obvious.

Options
-------
This section contains 4 CheckBox gadgets. These are as follows:

  @{i}Gadget Name             Does@{ui}
  Copy Comments           When ticked, comments will be copied from the FD
                          file to the generated file

  Copy extra info         This will create some extra comments in the
                          generated file. They'll inform you of changes
                          between private and public functions, also bias
                          changes. This was included so some FD files make
                          more sense when Copy Comments is ticked.
  
  Access Macro            When ticked, FDConvert will make a library access
                          macro for you.

  Name Macro              When ticked, FDConvert will make a library name
                          macro for you.

All the options default to off. If you want just a LVO include without any
trimmings then dont tick any options. The filesize of the generated file
will normally be considerably smaller when none of the options are ticked
(this, of course, depends entirely on the FD file you're converting).

Copy Comments can be usefull when using the Commodore FD files as they
normally tell you the version of the library the LVO's are in.

When using the macro options, you may notice some descrepencies in the
names. This is NOT a bug. FDConvert works out the name of the library by
taking the characters between the leading _ and the word Base as the name
of the library. If someone desides to call their library base 'fubar' then
the macro functions WONT work.

The underscored letters on some of the gadgets denote a keyboard shortcut.

@node dist "FDConvert - Distribution"

FDConvert is freely redistributable as long as all files remain intact and
are unchanged. You may not charge anything for FDConvert except a small
copying fee which can be no more then the cost of 1 blank DSDD floppy disk.

If magazines wish to include FDConvert on their coverdisk, they MUST send me
a copy of the magazine it appears on.
