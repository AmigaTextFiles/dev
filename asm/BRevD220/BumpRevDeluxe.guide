@NODE COPYRIGHT

     This is the second version  of  BumpRevision.  There  may  be  no
     additional releases, because I don't belive that this version has
     many bugs. (It isn't very complex!) Perhaps  I'll  add  some  new
     features if the feedback is alright.

     This version is freeware. This means that everybody can use it as
     they like without paying any money. But I - as the author - don't
     loose my copyright on this program. If  I  believe  it's  a  good
     idea, I might re-release it as  shareware  or  include  it  in  a
     commercial product.

     If you like this tool, don't hesitate  to  use  it,  but  do  not
     change my name as the author in any way.

     Spreading this program on so  called  "Public  Domain  Disks"  is
     *NOT*  allowed  without  my  explicit  permission.  (This  dosn't
     include the Fred Fish collection!) But I agree to  every  way  of
     spreading that doesn't charge money as FTP or  via  bulletin  box
     systems.

@NODE "WHAT IS IT?"

     This is a tool for all assembly language  programmers  who   want
     to  document  the  changes   at    the    different    revisions.
     BumpRevision Deluxe generates the   well-known   $REVISION-HEADER
     autoMAGICally and allows you to comment the changes.

     Additionally, the latest version number and the revision-date  is
     included in the source-code as a @{"macro," ALINK MACRO-USAGE} so you can easily  update
     things like version-strings in your own programs.

     BumpRevision Deluxe requires an ordinary AMIGA equipped  with  OS
     2.0. (Administering gadgets under OS 1.3 was a lot of work!)


     This is an example-header:

;****** Auto-Revision Header (do not edit) *******************************
;*
;* © Copyright by Gods - Software Development
;*
;* Filename         : Foobar.asm
;* Created on       : 21-Jun-92
;* Created by       : Peter Simons
;* Current revision : V0.000
;*
;*
;* Purpose: This is just a demonstration of what this program does...
;*
;* V0.000 : --- Initial release ---
;*
;*************************************************************************
REVISION        MACRO
                dc.b "0.000"
                ENDM
REVDATE         MACRO
                dc.b "21-Jun-92"
                ENDM

     You should *NOT* edit anything in the header by hand. For example
     the first ";* V" is needed to find the last revision  and  insert
     this one before. All revisions behind that aren't changed in  any
     way, so you can change the text there.

     The header needn't start at the first line  of  the  source-code.
     You can even split the revision-header  and  the  macros  as  you
     like, as long as you do *NOT* delete or add any blanks  or  other
     characters.

     The "Copyright", "Filename", "created on" and "created by"  lines
     are touched only at the generating of  the  header,  so  you  can
     change them, too. ("Current Revision" is of course changed  every
     time, so stay away from that entry!)

     BumpRevision Deluxe tries to read two environment-variables named:
     "COMPANY" [max. 34 chars] and "AUTHOR" [max. 24 Chars].  You  can
     set them using the Shell-command SetENV. Their contents are added
     in the "Copyright" and "Created by" lines. (Just try it out...)
@ENDNODE


@NODE MACRO-USAGE

     The usage of the macros may be seen in the following example:

             dc.b    "$VER BumpRevision "
             REVISION
             dc.b    " ("
             REVDATE
             dc.b    )",0

     is gonna be assembled to

             dc.b    "$VER BumpRevision 0.000 (21-Jun-92)",0


     NOTE: If you do *NOT* want  BumpRevision  Deluxe  to  create  and
           update these macros, just delete them in your  source-code,
           and BumpRevision will skip this feature the next time...

@NODE FEATURES

     This version of BumpRevision Deluxe  includes  a  completely  new
     designed GUI. For example you can now select the  comment-string-
     gadgets via keyboard-shortcut.

     Then the gadgets support the tab-cycling-feature of OS 2.0.  This
     means, that you can switch to the next gadget by simply  pressing
     the TAB key.  SHIFT+TAB  will  switch  to  the  previous  gadget.
     Pressing RETURN will unselect  every  gadget,  so  that  you  can
     choose the next action via shortcut.

     Additionally, empty  lines  will  be  truncated  by  BumpRevision
     Deluxe, in order to keep the header as small as possible. If  you
     can't mess with cutting-lines, you'll have to insert a  space  in
     the comment-gadget.

     A "New" possibility is  to  append  the  revision-author  to  the
     current revision. This  feature  can  be  en-/disabled  with  the
     "Include Author-Line"-checkbox. The name of the  author  is  read
     from @{"the enviroment variable \"AUTHOR\"" ALINK "WHAT IS IT?" 54} and will be copied  to  the
     gadget, formatted to the right  margin,  also  the  date  of  the
     revision will be appended to the line (in brackets).


     You may edit this line as you wish, before you select "Okay", and
     append it to this revision!

     The last thing is, that the window will now be  opened  centered,
     even  if  you're  working  in  interlace  or  NTSC-Overscan.  The
     position  of  the  AboutWindow  is  calculated  relative  to  the
     position of the main window. Also, all gadgets in the main window
     will be de-activated, so you can't missuse them. :-))
@ENDNODE

@NODE SYNTAX

     BumpRevision Deluxe requires only one  parameter:  The  path   to
     the file that is going  to  be  updated.  If  you  call   BumpRev
     without  any  parameter  the  well-known  Usage-message  will  be
     displayed.  You  can  specify  filenames  that  include    blanks
     without  quotation-marks, beause  the  whole  line  is  taken  as
     filename.

     virus, here are the CRC-checksums of this version. If you believe
     they've been changed, just @{"contact me" ALINK "IDEAS, SUGGESTIONS"} and ask  for  the  original
     values. Don't forget the @{"revision number." ALINK MAIN}

@NODE GREETINGS

     My greetings belong to Kai Iske, who included such a tool as  one
     of the first in his KCommodity (Look out for this  commodity,  it
     is unbelievable!) where I got my ideas from. (I thought it was  a
     bit overreacting to load a 70k  commodity  just  to  update  ones
     source-codes :-»)

     Thanks to Bullfrog for proofreading my horrible school-english!
