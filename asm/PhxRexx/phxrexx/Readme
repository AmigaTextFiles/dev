This package contain two arexx scripts for CygnusEd and PhxAss.

1) PhxAss.ced

        This script will help you assembler your source with PhxAss from
        CygnusED.

	Added two new features:

	- Requesters can be turned off (see rexx script)
	- Save to binary by inserting this line in top of the source:

---
*>C:MyProg

[source]

---
	  If this line isn't present it will save to default ram:test.
	  If requesters are on you will get as before:


        - You now get a inputrequester asking you for a binary file name
          Here you can set default name within the arexx script.
        - Press return and the script will start 'PhxAss'
          (change path to where you contain your PhxAss program)
        - The assemble result will now pop up in another CED window.
        - If any errors nothing more will happand
        - If all went ok you will get a question about if you want to start
          the binary file. If you press return (typed 'y') it will start with
          a default output console which you can edit in the script.
          If you press DEL and return (or ype anything else) the script will
          stop.

        For more information please read the arexx script itself.

2) InsertAsmtext.ced

        This script will format a whole page to assembler dc.b lines.

        USAGE:

        You need to open a new window. Use the whole field to edit your text.
        When you're done start the script:
        - The script will now insert <tab>dc.b<tab>" in front of each line
          and add ",10 at every end of line.
        - The script does not check " or ' in text. Use ' in your text or
          change the "" of the beginning and end of line (or the arexx
          script)
        - Cut the whole block and quit. Insert the block in your data section
          or the source. Assemble your source with PhxAss.ced
