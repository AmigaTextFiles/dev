DESCRIPTION

SConv converts Matt Dillions DAsm2.12 object files to S-RECORD format.
The first default format must be used for assembling.
Inspired by the 68HC11 assembler support but alas no S-RECORD.

USAGE 

Sconv inputfile [outputfile]

If no outputfile is specified, standard output will be used.

Have fun!
