About
-----
These converters converts between RAW c64 file to P00 format and vice
versa, used by C64 emulators. These small tools works, but was never
released to the public (don't as me why), however they are assembled with
asm-one, so you can improve the source, compile and release it if you want
as the sources are freeware. Back then i was a member of Depth "Sweden",
but today i'm in OldSk00l Crackers. Releasing freeware stuff.

Remember, A 19 years old tool never relesed, not even compiled to friends,
just compiled to test it.

Enjoy!
