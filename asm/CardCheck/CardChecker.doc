Distribution:

It is forbidden to include this on a magazine coverdisk without first
writing to me to make sure you include the latest version, and also,
I'd appreciate a copy of the magazine featuring my program.
No other limitations are implied on the distribution.

If you include this routine in your programs, please consider giving
me credit for what I've done, and why not send me a copy of the program?

BackGround:

I came across an algorithm for checking credit card numbers, and decided
to write this short program to put the algorithm to the test.
I can't actually think of a use for this (Except maybe you'd like to
incorporate the routines in an automated ordering program like the SASG
registration program)
If you can think of a use for this, please mail me, and I'll do more work on
this ;^)

This program will check the checksum of a card, and report it as valid/invalid,
as an added bonus, it will print the issuer of the card if known.
I only know the prefix of a few banks, If you send me the name of your Bank
or Building Society, and the first four numbers of your credit/debit card, I'll
add support for them.

*NB* This is not a means for me to get credit card numbers for fraudulent
purposes. I only need the first four numbers of your card, this is useless
to a fraudster, but allows me to identify cards from different banks/building
societies.
