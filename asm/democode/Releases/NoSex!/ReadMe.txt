Ok, to compile these sources use asm-one compatible assembler.  Should be
relatively easy to compile under phxass too.

  compile effect, don't run it, but look in the beginning of the source for the name
of the executable file.  Then save it with that name to a directory. After you have
compiled all files except the loader file and saved them to the SAME directory you
have to copy <missing-files> directory to that directory.  After that enter dosprompt,
go to that directory you put all files into and run loader.

  I was feeling lazy so I didn't change the paths for various data files so you have
to do it by yourself.  Shouldn't be too hard.

  Look in aminet for some other sources released by me NOT needing any loader which
can be run straight after compiling.

 And those chunky files named cncdxx.c are named that way because I did them after seeing
Killer demo by cndc, which has absolutely fantastic textures.  These textures by me aren't
anyway that fantastic ;)  JThey are ust lame rendered with some lw-textures and
photoshopped(with photogenics and ppaint) by me.

 One last word, if you find these sources any way useful please greet me in your demos or
whatever.  You are absolutely free to modify these sources to suit your needs.

That mod file -prototyyppi- is copyrighted by broom/zenon so keep your dirty
fingers away from it!

If there is any questions about these sources mail to me at : mluukkai@rieska.oulu.fi
