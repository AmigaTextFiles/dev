SetDepth

POSTMORTEM****This program FAILS under Kickstart 3.0!!!
But great for 1.3 peoples!!!!!

SetDepth is a utility to change the number of colors available on any screen.
It is very flexible and powerful.

USES:

If you do not yet have version 2.0 of the operating system, you can use SetDepth
to give yourself an 8 color Workbench screen, allowing you to use 8 color icons.

(Use SetColor to set the extra four colors.)

If you are running low on memory, set the Workbench depth to 1 (2 colors), and
you will have more memory to work with.

If a program crashes and hangs, but you still have work to complete before
you can reset, set that program's screen to a depth of 1 so you have more
memory to work with.

If you have Workbench 2.0, you probably are using 8 or 16 colors.  If so, when
you do a lot of Shell work you can temporarily set the number of colors to 2
or 4 and text display will be accelerated considerably.  Then, when you are
done, set the depth back to where it was originally.

If certain programs' graphics operate too slowly for your taste, or take up a lot
of memory, try stripping a bitplane or two off of them.

SetDepth can also tell you how many bitplanes a particular screen has currently.

LIMITATIONS:

Some programs do not make any usage of extra colors you might give them, so
adding bitplanes may do nothing observable.  Other programs may not take kindly
to having bitplanes removed.  I have not seen any programs crash after I removed
bitplanes, but I'm sure someone has figured out how to make my program crash 
their program.

ERRORS:

Workbench 1.x does not seem to support 16 colors very well.  It sometimes crashed
my A3000 running 1.3, my A500 running 1.2, and an A2000HD running 1.3.

SetDepth requires no memory, (it uses the stack), opens only libraries that are
in every Amiga's ROM, and appears bug-free under 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 on A500's, A2000's,
and A3000's.
