Output:  Cheap docs

There are instructions contained in the program.  Run the program, and
double click the AppIcon.

Output sets up an AppIcon under 2.0 that processes IFF files.  It is a crude
and simple program.

For example, to set it up to view pictures, play sounds, and view text files:

Select the icon in workbench and choose Information...

Add the tooltypes

8SVX=C:Hear *
ILBM=SYS:Utilities/See *
TEXT=SYS:Utilities/Read *

* is where the argument will be inserted.  Arguments can be passed, e.g.
ILBM=SYS:Utilities/See * PAL
will force See to show all pictures in PAL.

TEXT is called when the file is not IFF (like ASCII).

Yes this is crude.  But it allows you to add any IFF file type and choose
your own viewer, editor, or any other program.  I dropped it in my WBStartup
drawer.

I wrote this program a long time ago for my own personal use.  Future versions

It seems sort of like MultiView, doesn't it.  I always thought it was strange
how I mailed this program to Commodore to see if they wanted to include a
similar program with the OS, and I never heard from them.  They've answered
every other letter I sent, except when I mailed them this program.  Hmmmmm.....

Actually, this program works well with multiview.  I have TEXT set to MultiView
so it will show text and AmigaGuide files I drop on it.  Try this.
