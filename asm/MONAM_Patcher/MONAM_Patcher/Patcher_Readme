This little program update @{b}@{u}ANY version@{ub}@{uu} @{b}@{i}of Monam program@{ub}@{ui} by Hisoft to a new
@{fg shine}3.09 version@{fg text}, that read any library, device & resource.

It is an evolution of previous CLI patcher program: You don't need an assign
to FD or INCLUDE directory, You can choose from a file (NdR » directory)
requester this.


@{b}@{fg shine}ATTENTION PLEASE !!! YOU CANNOT CREATE MONAM.LIBFILE WITHOUT MONAM PROGRAM@{ub}@{fg text}


When You select @{"START" link "Document_0" 0} (HI ! HI ! HI!....), the program make:

- Directory Requester for *.FD files dir

- Scan this dir for FD

This scanning start from the #bias XX of *.fd's init:
     
  -  6 equ resource

  - 30 equ library

  - 42 equ device

(the Amiga Guru Book is very very Good !!!)

- Elaborate a new Monam.LibFile & write this into Ram: directory

- File requester for original Monam program (ANY VERSION » 3.03!! - NOT 3.07)

- Elaborate this into new version 3.09
