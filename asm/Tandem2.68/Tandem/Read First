Following the previous pre-release of Tandem on Aminet, this is
release 1 of Tandem, Version 2.68, released April 2000.

Tandem requires at least 1Meg to run, and AmigaOS 2.04+

To @{b}Run@{ub} Tandem, click the @{b}Tandem.exe@{ub} icon.

If you save prefs from within Tandem, @{b}ENVARC:tandem.prefs@{ub} will exist.


You can do the following @{b}(optional)@{ub} CLI commands if you want to:

   copy    tandem/tandem.library  to  LIBS:tandem.library
   delete  tandem/tandem.library


You must have the Amiga Developer CD (published by Schatzruhe) to use
Tandem, and preferably the 2.04 RKM's, published by Addison Wesley.


@{b}Improvements on Release 1@{ub}

The previous pre-release of Tandem proved very stable and robust. Only 1
important bug was found, which on some configurations of Amiga caused
Tandem to refuse to assemble in rare instances. This has been fixed.

I have also made the following improvments:

1. Tandem now opens on the default public screen. You can still cause it
   to use its own screen by Clicking "Prefs" and setting preferences
   appropriately.

2. Tandem now remembers the position and size of its windows, and restores
   them to those sizes and positions (if possible) next time you run it.

3. The <Tab> key now operates in the normal Amiga fashion, and will
   jump to tab positions in multiples of 8, in Tandem's text editor.

4. The icon for the Demo program has been fixed to run ok with OS3.5 (as
   well as OS2.04+).

5. An additional parameter for TLreqshow to show a line initially
   highlighted.

6. TLdemo has been re-written.
