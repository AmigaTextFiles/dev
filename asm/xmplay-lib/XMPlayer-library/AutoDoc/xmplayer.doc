   NAME
	XMPl_Init -- Inits a player structure & player.

   SYNOPSIS
	error=XMPl_Init(XMPlayerInfo)
	  D0	  A0

	BOOL XMPl_Init(struct XMPlayerInfo *);

   FUNCTION
	This function initialize a XMPlayerInfo filled by user and initialies a player.

   INPUTS

	XMPlayerInfo - a structure XMPlayerInfo filled by user

	XMPlayerInfo must be filled with the following information:
        -----------------------------------------------------------
	XMPl_Cont = pointer to a FastTracker module (XM).
	XMPl_MixType = type of module mixing. Following types available:
			XM_MONO = mono mixing - fast but low quality.
			XM_STEREO = stereo mixing - fast and medium quality.
			XM_SURROUND = stereo surround mixing - pseudo surround,
                                      partly eliminates "Paula Stereo" problem.
			XM_REALSURR = stereo real surround mixing - better surround,
                                      partly eliminates "Paula Stereo" problem.
			XM_STEREO14 = 14 bit stereo mixing - high quality but slowest.
	XMPl_MixFreq = mixing frequency in Hz (0-n). Maximum frequency is dependent from
                       display mode. High mixing frequency works slower.
	XMPl_VBoost  = volume boost value (0-8).
	XMPl_PrName  = pointer to NULL terminated string which contain name for player
                       process.
	XMPl_PrPri   = Priority for player process (-127 - 127).

   RESULT
	In D0 returns FALSE if initialization fails.

   NOTES
 	XMPlayerInfo MUST be filled with valid values and XMPl_Cont must be a XM module.

   NAME
	XMPl_Play -- Plays a FastTracker module.

   SYNOPSIS
	error = XMPl_Play()
        D0

	BOOL XMPl_Play(void);

   FUNCTION
	This function creates port (see XMPlayerInfo -> XMPl_PrName) and
	plays a FastTracker module.

   INPUTS
	NONE

   RESULT
	error - if the player started successfully, this will be TRUE.
		Else an error value will be FALSE.

   NOTES
	You cannot play two module at the same time.

   NAME
	XMPl_StopPlay -- Stops playing a FastTracker module.

   SYNOPSIS
	XMPl_StopPlay()

	void XMPl_StopPlay(void);

   FUNCTION
	This function stops playing a FastTracker module.

   INPUTS
	NONE

   RESULT
	NONE

   NOTES
	You cannot stop if you don't call XMPl_Play becourse this will wait for
	player process ends and creates a infinite loop.
