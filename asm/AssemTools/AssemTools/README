	MC68000 ASSEMBLY TOOLBOX by Supervisor Software
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




This is a collection of files which should be of great interest to
Amiga assembly language programmers.  The collection includes about
140 macro routines which make assembly language programming a lot
easier.
For example, there is a routine to build the menu structures using
simple instructions given in an (almost) ASCII string.  Also, there
is a routine to create any type of gadgets.

There is also a library of routines called sslib.lib to be used with
ALink/BLink.  The library contains buffered C-like file handling
routines (fopen, fclose, fgets, fputs etc) and a file name requester.
All routines are re-entrant (they can be called by several processes
simultaneously).

And finally, there are several example programs which use the macros
defined in the include files.  The best way to learn to use all these
routines is to examine the source codes and include files.

I'm sorry but I haven't got enough time to write full documentation
for all routines just now.  I may do that in the future but I make
no promises.  However, the macro libraries will be updated from time
to time (mainly because we are using them ourselves).

If you have any suggestions or bug reports or extra dollars I would
like to hear from you!  A small donation ($20...$50) would be greatly
appreciated.  It has taken a long time to write all these routines...

Note:  Not all the example programs use the latest macros.  For
example, the Asm65 65c02 cross assembler was written a long time
before I wrote the buffered file handling routines (in sslib.lib).
I just wanted to include it because I know there are people out there
trying to develop programs for 6502/65c02 on the Amiga.

Please excuse my bad English.  I know assembly language much better
than I know English, I think...  :-)
