These files can be compiled using A68k v2.42, a PD assembler for the
Amiga.




FUTURE CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The longest  macros will be  compiled and  placed in the sslib.lib to
  shorten the include files and speed up the assembly of user programs.
  Calling procedure ("strlib strcmp" etc) will remain the same.

* Bugs will be fixed and more routines written.
