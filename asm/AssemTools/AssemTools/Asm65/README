Asm65 is a cross-macroassembler for Amiga - exclusively written for
Amiga in assembly language.  The development started in April, 1988
and is still in progress although I only edit the source file when
new bugs are found.
I wrote this compiler because I designed a small controller board
using the Rockwell 65c02 CMOS processor and I didn't want to compile
the programs on a C-64...  I also wanted to be able to use macros
which weren't available on my old SAKU assembler on C-64 (SAKU was
also written by me - in 6502 assembly language, of course!).

My 65c02 board supports limited multitasking (max. 16 tasks can run
simultaneously).  Each task has it's own private zero page and stack
which are swapped by hardware to allow fast task-switching.
My software currently supports inter-task messages and dynamic memory
allocation (allocated in blocks of 256 bytes).
The board contains a 65c02, two 65c22's, 32KB RAM, and 32KB EPROM.
It runs reliably at 2,45MHz (using 2Meg chips).  The current consump-
tion is about 20mA at 5V.

If you are interested in the 65c02 board OR want to get the latest
version of Asm65 OR want to send your contribution you can contact

P.S.	If you like this program I would  appreciate a small
	donation from you!  You know,  it takes some time to
	write a macro assembler...  You may also ask for the
	latest  version of the Asm65 (or the  source code if
	you  especially want  to get it - but the  source is
	*terrible* :-o ).

	Thanks for your contribution!

	-jm

P.P.S.	The sources are now included.  But - you shouldn't
	read them unless it is absolutely necessary.
	Bug reports etc. are welcome.  I'm trying to update
	Asm65 whenever it is needed...     ~~~~~~
	However, I've got my job...

12-Mar-89:

	Re-compiled using A68k...  Several branches converted to
	short using a special utility.  Executable now smaller
	and faster (well, at least a bit...).
