   NCode: The conditional macro assembler for MC68000/10/20/30
   -----------------------------------------------------------

NCode is a conditional macro assembler for the Motorola MC68000,
MC68010, MC68020 and MC68030 that produces object code for the
Commodore AMIGA. The assembler offers the possibility to put
your standard assembler options (for example the target CPU and
the page length) in an argument file.

NCode is a two pass assembler that never rereads the source file
in the second pass. Instead, it keeps the file in memory (also
needed to produce the listing) and only rescans the forward
references. This can speed up the assembly time significantly,
especially when you're using slow floppy drives or lots of
include files. In fact the gain of speed is most noticeable at
large source files with many include files. Unfortunately,
sending the listing file to the screen is slow, because of the
use of standard I/O routines. If you want your listings to go to
the screen, you might want to turn off the listing (the assembler
will still produce error messages). This can be done by the
"NOLIST"-directive. To further speed up the process of writing
assembly language programs, NCode will produce executable code
whenever possible. So, if your source contains no external
references or definitions, you won't need the linker.

NCode is compatible with most assemblers for the AMIGA and uses
the standard Motorola syntax for both instructions and operands.

See the manual for further details on the supported assembler
directives, conditional assembly and macro's. There is an English
and Dutch manual included (files Manual.English and
Manual.Dutch).
