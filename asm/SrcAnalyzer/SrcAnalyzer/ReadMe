			Program Title : SrcAnalyzer
			---------------------------
			Author : Laurence Vanhelsuwé
			----------------------------

1. How to "install":
   -----------------

	"SrcAnalyzer" is a standalone executable.
	It doesn't need any assigns or run-time files.

2. How to use it:
   --------------

	SrcAnalyzer is used to analyse 68000 source files to determine
	mnemonic frequencies.
	The program produces an ASCII file called "chart.dat" of the format

		:
	XXXXX MNEM
	XXXXX MNEM
	XXXXX MNEM
		:

	Where XXXXX is a decimal integer and MNEM is the assembler mnemonic
	string (Use program "Chart" to display a bargraph of this data).
	Any source lines with unknown mnemonics are dumped to standard out.

	I wrote this program to get an idea of which 68K instructions are
	most frequently used.
	This information in turn can be used to optimize the parsing of
	mnemonics in a 68K assembler.


	Any comments, ideas or bug reports?
