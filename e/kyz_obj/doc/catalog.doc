   PURPOSE
	To act as the base class for localized ID/string pairs.

   OVERVIEW
	The  locale  library  contains  a  mechanism for isolating textual
	strings  in  program  code (such as "OK", "Please select file" and
	other  strings  for the benefit of the user) and allowing for them
	to  be  changed  externally  from the program, while still holding
	'default'  copies of the strings in the program core. This creates
	the opportunity to have 'localized' strings.

	The default mechanism for this is with two 'catalog' files, Bla.cd
	and Bla.ct, where the .cd file is the catalog of 'descriptors' and
	the .ct file is a catalog of translations for a specific language.

	The .cd file contains your original text strings, and an uppercase
	identifier for each of them. Example:

	MSG_OPEN_FILE (//)
	Open file...

	The  identifier  is  translated into a numerical ID, and using the
	'const' / 'define'  feature  of most programming languages, the ID
	name is associated with that unique numerical value.

	When  you  wish  to use a string in your program, you would get it
	from a function taking the ID and returning the string.

	filereq('Open file...')
	BECOMES
	filereq(get(MSG_OPEN_FILE))

	What  the  catalog_obj does is represent the catalog as an object,
	thereby allowing you easy use of multiple catalogs, and using even
	single  catalogs  very  easily. The general mechanism for actually
	using  catalogs  is to subclass the bare catalog object and set up
	default preset values - catalog name, builtin strings, language of
	builtin strings, and possibly version.

   EXAMPLE
	See the included example files showing a localised 'helloworld'.

	A  FlexCat  '.sd'  file,  included and used by the example, can be
	used for automatic generation of compiled catalog modules from .cd
	files.

catalog.m/def                                                   catalog.m/def

   NAME        
	catalog_obj.def() -- Set up the default strings block.

   SYNOPSIS
	def(block:PTR TO LONG)

   FUNCTION
	Set the catalog's block of default strings. This is best kept as a
	static  list with constants and static strings in it - the catalog
	neither  copies  the strings nor the block into its own memory, it
	uses the block and strings direct from whatever you pass it.

   INPUTS
	block - a list containing ID/string pairs, see the example below.

   EXAMPLE
	CONST MSG_HELLO=100, MSG_BYE=101
	catalog.def([
	  MSG_HELLO, 'Hello',
	  MSG_BYE',  'Bye'
	])

   NOTE
	The block _must_ be terminated with a long containing NIL. Amiga E
	does  this  automatically  when you use the list operator, but not
	when  you  use  the builtin-assembler 'LONG' directive, or magic a
	list up yourself.

	In other words, just use this as shown and you'll be fine.

catalog.m/end                                                   catalog.m/end

   NAME
	catalog_obj.end() -- Destructor.

   SYNOPSIS
	end()

   FUNCTION
	Frees resources used by an instance of the catalog_obj class.

catalog.m/get                                                   catalog.m/get

   NAME
	catalog_obj.get() -- Get a localized message string.

   SYNOPSIS
	string := get(id)

   FUNCTION
	Attempts  to  retrieve  a  string from the opened catalog with the
	requested  ID value. If not in the catalog, it will look for it in
	the  block of default strings. If not there either, it will return
	NIL.

   INPUTS
	id - the ID value associated with the required string.

   RESULT
	string - the  requested  string,  possibly  translated,  or NIL if
	         there is no such string available.

catalog.m/open                                                 catalog.m/open

   NAME
	catalog_obj.open() -- Constructor.

   SYNOPSIS
	open(catalog, language, locale:PTR TO locale)

   FUNCTION
	Creates an instance of the catalog class. Opens the locale library
	and appropriate translations of the catalog as neccesary.

	As  no  minimum  level  of  allocations  are  necessary to operate
	correctly, this constructor throws no exceptions.

	Apart from calling this constructor, you should also call def() to
	set up default strings before starting to call get().

   INPUTS
	catalog  - The  name  of  the catalog containing your strings, for
	           example 'helloworld.catalog'. Must not be NIL.

	language - A  string  representing the name of the language of the
	           default strings you supply - for example, 'français' or
	           'deutsch'.  If  the language of the defaults strings is
	           'english', you can pass NIL instead.

	locale -   If  you  are  using  a particular locale structure from
	           OpenLocale(),  you  may  pass  this  in  to  affect the
	           opening and parsing of the catalog. If you just want to
	           use  the default locale (user's preference) then simply
	           pass NIL.
