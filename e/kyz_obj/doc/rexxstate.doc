   PURPOSE
	To control the global aspects of the ARexx system.

   OVERVIEW
	ARexx  is  an  interpreter program which has the ability to trace,
	start,  pause,  and  cancel  the  ARexx scripts that it runs. This
	object allows you to control these global ARexx processes:

	- whether ARexx is running or not (RexxMast / RXC)
	  running(), start(), shutdown()
	- whether ARexx scripts are suspended or not
	  suspended(), suspend(), resume()
	- whether the ARexx console is open or not (TCO/TCC)
	  console_open(), open_console(), close_console()
	- whether ARexx is running in trace mode or not (TS/TE).
	  tracing(), trace_on(), trace_off()

	There  is  also  a method to immediately and irreversibly halt all
	running ARexx programs, which simulates the HI command.

   NOTE
	The  state  of  ARexx  is global, and this class respects that, it
	shows  and sets this global ARexx state, it does not hold seperate
	states  in  individual  instances of the class, so therefore using
	more than one instance does not make sense, and is unneccessary.

	This class is based on the guts of commands in SYS:RexxC/

	Still todo is RXSET, RX is done by other/sendrexx.m and
	WaitForPort / RXLIB aren't all that useful?!

   FUNCTION
	Shuts the ARexx trace and debugging console, like the TCC command.

   RESULT
	succeeded - TRUE if the console is now shut, otherwise FALSE.

   SYNOPSIS
	open := console_open()

   FUNCTION
	Checks if the ARexx trace and debugging console is open or not.
