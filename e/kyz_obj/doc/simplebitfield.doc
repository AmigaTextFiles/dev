   PURPOSE
	To provide a simple bitfield.

   OVERVIEW
	Implements  the  same  concepts  as  bitfield.m,  but a great many
	services  are  removed  or simplified, for applications where only
	the simple get/set/clear functionality of a bitfield is needed.

   SEE ALSO
	bitfield.m

   NAME
	simplebitfield.set() -- set an individual bit.
	simplebitfield.clear() -- clear an individual bit.
	simplebitfield.test() -- test an individual bit.

   SYNOPSIS
	state := set(bit)
	state := clear(bit)
	state := test(bit)

   FUNCTION
	Will  test,  then perform an operation on an individual bit in the
	bitfield:

	set()    will set the bit to boolean TRUE.
	clear()  will clear the bit to boolean FALSE.
	test()   will perform no altering operation on the bit.

	The  bit  specified  must  not lie outwith the range stored by the
	bitfield, otherwise innocent data _will_ be corrupted.

   INPUTS
	bit   - the bit to perform an operation on.

   RESULT
	state - the  previous  state  of  the bit before the operation was
	        performed on it, either TRUE or FALSE.

simplebitfield.m/clearfield                       simplebitfield.m/clearfield

   NAME
	simplebitfield.clearfield() -- clear all bits.

   SYNOPSIS
	clear()

   FUNCTION
	Clears all bits in the bitfield to boolean FALSE.

simplebitfield.m/end                                     simplebitfield.m/end

   NAME
	simplebitfield.end() -- Destructor.

   SYNOPSIS
	end()

   FUNCTION
	Frees resources used by an instance of the bitfield class.

   SEE ALSO
	new()

simplebitfield.m/new                                     simplebitfield.m/new

   NAME
	simplebitfield.new() -- Constructor.

   SYNOPSIS
	new(max)

   FUNCTION
	Initialises  an  instance  of the bitfield class. Raises exception
	"MEM"  if it cannot allocate enough memory for the required number
	of bits. All bits are initially cleared.

   INPUT
	max   - the  maximum integer value that will be represented in the
	        field. Must be positive. The minimum will be 0.

   SEE ALSO
	end(), clearfield()
