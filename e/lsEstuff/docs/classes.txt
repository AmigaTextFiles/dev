Give me a mail if youre interested in anything!


---xl---
The basic list class, just next, prev in nodes.
Lotsa nice methods!

---xli---
Inherits xl
Handle nodes with ID (LONG)
Methods for sort()ing, find()ing,
ordInsert(), mergeing, etc..


---smartList---
* Uses xli but is not compatible except nodewise.
* Interface like xli but fewer methods.
* Use this one for very big lists, 200+ nodes.
* VERY faast find() and ordAdd().
  ex. with 10 000 nodes its ~40 times faster then xli! (theoretically)
* The backside is a slower list.remove(node) and that u cant use
  the nodes next and prev fields directly (unless u really know
  what youre doin). Use list.next(node) and list.prev(node) for that.
* Eats some percentages more memory.



---bits---
Fast asm procedures for handling bits.


---dbmapX---
Uses xli and bits
Dynamic BitMap Class (1D)
Fast and neat.
Nice map <> map functions.

---dbmapYX---
Uses dbmapX and xli
Dynamic BitMap Class (2D)
Fast? and neat.
map <> map functions.

---dbmapZYX---
Not finnished yet
Dynamic BitMap Class (3D)
For feautures see dbmapYX


---newArrayX--- (this was xliv)
uses xli
Dynamic Array OF LONG. (1D)
Its basically a list with an array-interface.
(list functions also available)
Lotsa, lotsa nice feutures... :)
Many Array <> Array functions!


---newArrayYX---
uses newArrayX, xli
Dynamic Array OF LONG. (2D)
Lotsa nice feutures... :)

---newArrayZYX---
uses newArrayYX, xli
Dynamic Array OF LONG. (3D)
Lotsa nice feutures... :)


---libraries---
Uses xli
Class for handling libraries.
(resourcetracking)

---gle---
An GadListEngine of 5k :)
Class that generates nice gadtools GUI's.


---ipc---
Classes for Inter Process Communication.
newMsg, newPort, waitSigs


---msgserver---
Uses ipc and ???
Not finnished!
Something that should have been buildt in to the AOS long ago.


---thread---
Class for handling threads.
Not tested.
Based on (tested!) module.


---myfile---
Module with file I/O functions.


---mymem---
Module with memory functions.


---mystring---
Module with string functions.


---THE BIG PROJECT :)---
eulaliaII - XGMIDI and AHI - Tracker.
Uses MUI and is threaded and systemfriendly.
project started in dec 97.
Is put on hold for now.
