There's really almost nothing to say about this...

Just call stayrandom() once at the beginning of your program
to seed the random number generator (Amiga E's random number
generator).  Afterwards, enjoy better random numbers.

'stayrandom()' requires emodules:other/stderr.m be installed
so it can write its error messages.  It also opens the
timer.device to get mics.

Lemme know if you have probs with it.  As far as I can tell,
this works rather well.
