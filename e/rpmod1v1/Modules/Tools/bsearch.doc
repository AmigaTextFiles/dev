This module implements the binary sort algorithm in the most flexible way.

	PROC bsearch(base,first,last,find,comp) /* : LONG */

base:
	the start address of an ARRAY OF ? e.g. CHAR, INT, LONG, OBJECT ?.

first:
	the lowest position you want to search from

last:
	the highest position you want to search to

find:
	the item to find: value/pointer to value/etc

comp:
	a pointer to a PROC to compare the value at position
	with the value for find.

	e.g.

	PROC comp(base:PTR TO LONG, position, find:LONG)
	  DEF item

	  item := base[position]
	  IF item1 < find THEN RETURN -1
	  IF item1 > find THEN RETURN 1
	ENDPROC 0


If search failsThe result is -1 ($FFFFFFFF) if search fails.

Note:
  Any registers it uses are saved, but if your comp routine
uses registers other than D0/D1/D2/A0 and the caller of bsearch
needs them, then you will need to save them. bsearch doesn't
care which registers you use.

  The module contains 96 bytes of assembler / E code.

  The routine will only stay in a 68020+ code cache if the
PROC comp it calls is small and very close to it.

  The routine has been heavily tested, though there are no promises
and I won't be held responsible if you find bugs or you misuse the
routine.

  If you do find any bugs then please email me.
