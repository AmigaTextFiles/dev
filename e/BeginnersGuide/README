Beginner's Guide to Amiga E
===========================
Included in this archive are an AmigaGuide file "beginner.guide" and
an ANSI text file "beginner.txt".  The AmigaGuide file contains
special commands which nicely (?) highlight words.  Unfortunately
these are, at present, recognised only by the MultiView version of
AmigaGuide.  The v34 AmigaGuide simply ignores them, so you get plain
text.  I have a more v34-compatible version, but I thought I'd try to
keep the archive size down.  (Contact me if you want this version.)

The Beginner's Guide to Amiga E is Copyright (c) 1994, Jason R.
Hulance.  The AmigaGuide and ANSI text versions are Freely
Distributable, provided this file is included with them.  A TeX dvi
version and a PostScript version are also available, but at a small
cost of five (UK) pounds (I didn't want to make the Guide Shareware as
a whole).  Contact me for more details.

Amiga E v3.0
============
By the time v3.0 is released I hope to have updated this guide to
fully cover this version.  The new Guide will probably then be part of
Wouter's Shareware package.
