Short: First update patch to Amiga E v3.2a for registered programmers
Type: dev/e
Author: Wouter van Oortmerssen (wouter@mars.let.uva.nl)

This archive contains the EC v3.2e compiler for registered
programmers only (only a few quick bug-fixes), as well as
new versions of EDBG (with an Arexx-port and config saving),
and EasyGUI (with PLUGINs). read the docs in the archive.

Bugs fixed in v3.2e:
- procident.member gave weird errors
- preprocessor failed on 68000 in particular situations
- preprocessor didn't handle international characters
- '\0' in strings would cut them off
- EC would Lock() with an illegal mode from other dirs
- $FFFF as default arg became $FFFF0000
- macro errors could cause garbage to be printed on screen
- /* */ in comments failed
- inheriting from yourself wasn't detected
- didn't accept 0(A3,a) or 0(A3,a.L) or lab(PC,a) etc. where a:REG
- AND.L D0,a where a:REG changed src-dest

The patch program will read 'ec' (v3.2a registered) in the current dir
and output the new v3.2e compiler (also in the current dir).
