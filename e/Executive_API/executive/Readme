ExecutiveAPI.m
--------------

This is a conversion of the .h and the example provided with Executive 2.00.

To install it, copy the modules-directory to e:Modules

To use it, have a look at the excutive-documentation and the example-source.
I tried to keep the translation from C to E as starightforward as possible.

Any questions/comments?
