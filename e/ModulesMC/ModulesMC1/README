The module interval is an easy way to insert timing into a program.

The module randomize simultaneously randomizes Rnd and returns a seed for
RndQ.

The module realf provides a substitute for RealF until Wouter corrects the
problems with RealF, if he hasn't already.

The module writef is to be used with the various stringf options, if and only
if your version of dos.library is new enough to have the PutStr function.

The modules stringf20 and qstringf20 replace StringF if and only if you have
a 68020 or above chip. They are 80 bytes smaller than their 68000 cousins,
but not noticeably different in speed. If you have a 68000 chip, use the
versions without the 20 suffix.

The qstringf modules run 15 to 20 times faster than StringF. Without the
q they run 8 or 9 times faster. These speed differences apply only to an
Amiga 1200. Your machine may and probably will produce different results.

All the varieties of stringf produce binary strings when the %lb option is
used in the format string. All varieties must be used with a list as the
third argument, i.e. stringf(str,format,[datastream]). Read Estuff.doc and
look at the test programs to clarify this.

Estuff.doc has a few tips about speeding up E programs by inserting assembly
language. Comparing stringf20.e and stringf20.doc files will provide more
information on this subject.
