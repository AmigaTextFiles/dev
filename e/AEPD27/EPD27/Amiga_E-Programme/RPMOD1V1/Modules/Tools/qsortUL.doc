  This is a module containing a heavily optimised Quicksort routine
for ARRAY OF LONG ( unsigned values ), it sort the array in accending
order.

  There are 3 ways to call the routine:

  1.
	by direct machine code access to the core routine,
	pass two registers to it.

		A0 =  the start address of array
		A1 =  the end address of array

		BSR	qsortUL_mc

		  or

		JSR	qsortUL_mc


  2.
	by calling a PROC with the start and end address
	of the array.

		PROC qsortUL(first_p,last_p)

  3.
	by calling a PROC with the base address of array,
	a start index and an end index.

		PROC qsortULi(base_p,first,last)


Note:
  All 3 methods save any registers they use, the only exception is
A0 and A1 for qsortUL_mc.

  The module contains 184 bytes of assembler / E code and embedded
  copyright, please do not try to remove or reverse engineer.

  The routine has been heavily tested, though there are no promises
and I won't be held responsible if you find bugs or you misuse the
routines.

  If you do find any bugs then please email me.
