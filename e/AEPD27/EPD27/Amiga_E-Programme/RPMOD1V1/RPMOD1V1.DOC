AREXX scripts for CygnusED Pro 2.11+
------------------------------------
* Requirements

  OS 2.0+
	(you are crazy if you don't have at least this by _NOW_)

  RxGen.library in libs:		(not included)
	ALL library interface for AREXX and on Aminet.

  DOS.rxfd (OS2.0 updated) in REXX:	(included (OS3.0 version) )

* If you want the update the other files for RxGen get this.

  Native Developer User Kit for the FD files to update dos.rxfd to OS2.0+.
	ftp: ftp.rz.uni-wuerzburg.de/pub/amiga/frozenfish/bbs/cbm/NDUK-v??.lha
	(e.g. for V2.0 get NDUK-v37.lha, for V3.0 get NDUK-v39.lha)


* Scripts

doEC.ced
	Does the following:
		fixes some common (mine) mistakes;
		saves file;
		splits the 'view';
		calls the compiler;
		parses error text;
		marks any error with 'Mark location 1';
		shows status in an OKAY1 requester.

	Where the return code for the byte position is suspect then 'Mark
	location 2' is used to mark the given line number.  Only if there
	are no errors will the view unsplit.  In the 'OKAY1' requester
	all the details from the error / PASS are displayed formatted and
	any ANSI formatting codes removed.

	You will probably need to change some or all of the following
	variables:
	  'flush',
		the path/filename for flushlib or '' if you don't want to
		use it, I use it to stop the dumb module cache keeping old
		and version of module(s) when the compiler had compiled new
		version(s) of the module(s) since.
	  'compiler',
		the path/filename for the compiler;
	  'option',
		the compiler options, don't use ERRBYTE or ERRLINE;
	  'log',
		the path/filename for the error file;
	  'log2'
		the path/filename for the return code file;


openEmodule.ced
	Calls ShowModule and caches the result in a directory in RAM:  in
	case it is called again for the same module then loads the text
	file in a new window.

	You will need to change variable 'compiler' to the path/filename
	for the compiler.



	Notes
	-----
All the modules in here are Freeware, but are not allowed to be used in
commercial software except with my permission by snail mail or PGP signed
email (when I get PGP installed that is!).  Anyone who wants the source
code ?Wouter?  should email me.



	Glossary
	--------

BCPL
	a language that was used to write AmigaDOS 1.0..1.3 by Metacomco
	that originated at Cambridge University, England. The language
	is no longer used for writting AmigaDOS, C is used instead.
	Unfortunately we are stuck for compatability reasons with several
	structures and library routines which still use and require BCPL
	formatted addresses and strings.

BCPL string
	an array of characters in multiples of 4, the 1st character
	holds the length of the string and the remainder the string
	itself. Typically pointed to by a BPTR.

BPTR
	a BCPL pointer base on LONGs rather than CHAR
	e.g. CPTR = $001A3460, BPTR = $00068D18

BSTR
	a BPTR to a BCPL string.

CPTR
	a normal memory address.


	Planned Modules
	---------------
1.	An integer square root using the _fast_ method (the same
	method explained in an old issue of BYTE magazine for cube roots
	etc) _not_ Newton-Raphson divide by 2 method.
	No I'm not a maths nut, I pinched it from the forth source code
	and the hardware manual for the NOVIX RISC processor, figure that
	out if you can!


	Thanks

CygnusSoft & ASDG for CygnusEd Pro 2.11, still the best editor

Amiga and the Commodore(/ex) engineers and programmers for the best
computer and the best fully multi-tasking OS.

Blizzard for the wickedly fast Blizzard 1230 III 50MHz Accelerator card for
the A1200.

William S. Hawes for ARexx, I couldn't do without it.

Martin Korndörfer for Magic Menu.

De Montfort University Milton Keynes, for finally getting on the net in
January 1995, pity it has to be PCs (many crashes, mad-tasking Windows).

And finally you for reading this tripe, he he, enjoy :-))
