Short:    EasyGUI PLUGIN: Dbl-clickable listview
Type:     dev/e

    This plugin creates a GadTools listview gadget, almost identical to the
standard EasyGUI one, except that it will also report double-clicks on list
items.

Changes to this version
-----------------------

    v1.6 (19-Jan-99)

    -   added new tag, DCLV_USEARROWS.  This will allow scrolling the selected
        list item with the up/down cursor keys, instead of an underlined label
        key.
    -   if the selected item was changed with DCLV_CURRENT, self.top didn't
        get updated properly, causing problems if you needed to get(DCLV_TOP).
        Fixed.
    -   MAJOR bug fixed.  Reporting a double-click worked fine, as long as you
        closed your GUI afterwards.  If your GUI stayed open, any subsequent
        clicks would cause trouble.
