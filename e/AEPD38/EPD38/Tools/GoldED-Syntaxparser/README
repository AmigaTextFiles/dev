DESCRIPTION

  A collection of syntax parsers libraries for GoldED 3.

FEATURES

  written in pure assembly for maximum performance.

PROGRAMMER NOTES

  In order to assemble these parsers, use the assembly #?.i include files,
  that contain assembly equivalents of GoldED's #?.h files, as found in the
  GoldED distribution.
