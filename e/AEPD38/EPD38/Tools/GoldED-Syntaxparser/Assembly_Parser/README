DESCRIPTION

  A parser library for assembly language sources.

FEATURES

  Highlights assembly style comments; either full line comments, with
  an asterix ('*') as first non-space character, or partial line comment,
  introduced by a semicolon (';').

KNOWN BUGS

  A semicolon in a string ('; bla bla') or character value (#";" or #';')
  is falsly recognized as being a comment introducer.
