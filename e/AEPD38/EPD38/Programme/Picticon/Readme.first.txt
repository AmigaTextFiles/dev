Ok.  Read the guide's introductory piece, first!

Also, there's an undocumented feature:

Picticon  supports LOCALE, but I don't have very good catalog building
skills.  If you are able to create a catalog, by all means EMail it to
me!   I'll  credit ya, and include it in future Picticon releases.  If
you want, include your credits in the "QUIT|CANCEL" window.  Thanks to
Lionel  Vintenat  for  his  French  translations  of  both Iconian and
Picticon!

Please  EMail  me  with  suggestions.   I try and answer ALL email, so
expect  a  response.   Picticon works like *I* want.  But I'd like the
Amiga  community  to  take advantage of it, too.  SO...PLEASE email me
with  some  comments,  bugs  sightings,  and  suggestions  for  future
versions.  This is the only way you'll have a chance to see what *you*
want, instead of what *I* want.

Please,  DON'T  send  money.   This program is a gift.  If you want to
send  me money, register Iconian!  That program is worth it.  Picticon
really isn't.

Ok. See ya later.
