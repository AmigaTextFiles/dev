Copying and Disclaimers

    @{fg shine}Picticon@{fg text} was thrown together in a few days using bits and pieces of @{"Iconian" link "Iconian" 0}.  If you haven't gotten a copy of Iconian, find one.  It is the number one OS3.x icon editor you can get (IMHO).

    Since @{fg highlight}Picticon@{fg text} is a patchwork program that's held together by spaghetti sauce, many bugs will probably show up.  I will honestly claim that I can get consistent, satisfactory results at this time.  If you do run across any, please let me know.  SEE:  @{"Bugs" link "Bugs" 0}

So warn your fellow Amigans about excessive prices.

    There are several exceptions to this.  @{b}@{fg shine}Fred Fish@{ub}@{fg text} may include this program, of course.  He is the one spot any Amigan should be able to look to for quality material.

    @{b}@{fg shine}Aminet@{ub}@{fg text} also has free distribution rights.  This is another high-quality distribution network that should not be hampered in any way.

    Any @{b}@{fg shine}CD collection@{ub}@{fg text} can include @{fg highlight}Picticon@{fg text} for free.  CD's are a great source for programs.  Publishers of CD's rarely (never?) take seem to take advantage of end users.  (Unless they were to *only* include Picticon on a CD and then charge 19.95...  yea right)

    @{b}@{fg shine}Magazines@{ub}@{fg text} wishing to include @{fg highlight}Picticon@{fg text} on a coverdisk may do so on one condition.  I'd like a copy of the specific issue mailed to me.  My address is at the end of this guide.  10-30$ isn't alot considering all the issues a magazine sells.  Is it?  (A big thanks to Amiga User International for asking for Iconian in the past.)

Introduction

    @{fg highlight}Picticon@{fg text} is a conversion program that creates "thumbnail" icons from pictures.  This is accomplished through datatypes, and therefore many various formats are supported.

    Also, palette sharing routines are used to remap these scaled icons to the current Workbench's palette.

    Unlike previous similar programs, many options are available to customize what these icons look like.  These include background images, size text, centering, and sizes from real small to extrodinary large.  SEE:  @{"Tooltype Summary" link "Tooltypes" 0}

    A graphical status window is opened if run from Workbench or a Appicon.  This status window will be opened and closed many times, but it's position is remembered until you turn the computer off.  If you wish to set a permanent default position, then copy the file "Picticon.prefs" from ENV:  to ENVARC:.

    All visual information may be turned off by the QUIET tooltype@{"QUIET tooltype" link "Tooltypes" 0}.  This includes the status window and/or CLI output.  (Note, the CLI QUIET switch isn't operational, so use the >NIL:  pipe for now.)

    New features of version 0.90 include aspect scaling, fractional scaling, faster rendering, HAM support, and a complete CLI interface.


  There are three ways to run @{fg highlight}Picticon@{fg text}.

    CLI:  Recommended usage would be from a script.  A sample script is included.

    Workbench:  Seleting multiple icons, then double-clicking Picticon's icon will invoke conversion of the selected pictures.

    Appicon:  If run from Workbench without passed files, an Appicon will be opened.  Any "dropped" files will be processed.  To remove Picticon, just doubleclick the appicon and select "Quit".

@node "Require" "Requirements"

Requirements

    Any Amiga running at least Kickstart 3.0 and Workbench 3.0.

    At least 1 megabyte of RAM is required.  2 megs of CHIP and 4 megs of FAST is recommended.

    A 68000, but a faster processor is recommended.

    The external librarys "iffparse", "diskfont", and "mathtrans" of at least version 37.  All these are standard, so no problems should arise.

    A strong knowledge of palettes, colors, and tooltypes/cli is recommended for full feature utilization.

    A nice set of pictures.  Come on, at least one.  :) 

@endnode

@node "Usage" "Usage"

Usage

    Just double click the icon for an instant result.  Then drop a picture icon onto the newly created appicon.  If you need the picture to show up on Workbench, use the "Window-> Show-> All Files" Workbench menu option.

    Read the section "@{"Tooltype Summary" link "Tooltypes" 0}" for some better info on creating custom backgrounds, sizes, and overall looks.

@endnode

@node "Tooltypes" "Tooltype Summary"

Tooltype Summary

    x a numerical value
    B a boolean value (ie YES or NO, TRUE or FALSE, 1 or 0)
    $ a string, usually a file with directory path
    () What the option defaults to


APPICON=$ ('ENV:SYS/def_appicon') then,
          (program's icon) then,
          ('ENV:SYS/def_tool') then,
          (default tool icon supplied by Workbench)

    Names a user defined icon for the appicon image.  X and Y positions are set to NO_ICON_POSITION unless overridden by APP_X_POS and/or APP_Y_POS.


APP_X_POS=x (NO_ICON_POSITION) APP_Y_POS=x (NO_ICON_POSITION)

    Specifies where the appicon will appear, in typical unreliable Workbench fashion.


ASPECT_X=x (1) ASPECT_Y=y (1)

    Defines your screen aspect ratios.  If you are in hires, non-interlaced NTSC, then you could specify "ASPECT_X=2" and "ASPECT_Y=1".  This states that there are 2 horizontal pixels to every 1 vertical.


BACKGROUND_ICON=$ (none)

    Names a background you wish to overlay the picture over.  There is no default.  If the named icon does not exist, a blank workspace will be used.


CENTER=B (NO)

    Centers the image in the PIC___POS/PIC___SIZE rectangle.  Otherwise, it'll be upper-left justified.


CHUNKYMODE=B (NO)

    Turns on chunky image conversion.  This may allow certain types of graphic boards to save correct looking icons.  The conversion process is a bit slower, but much safer.


DITHER=B (YES)

    Turns error-diffusion dithering on or off.


FREE_ICON_POS=B (NO)

    If on, all saved icons will be "unsnapshot".  If off, then the template icon's position will be used.


FORCE_EIGHT=B (NO)

    Saves the icons with 8 planes, always.  This will only help with icons created with 3 planes (8 colors), and a MagicWB style palette setup.  Hopefully, everyone has switched to "shovecolors" by now, and won't need this option...  :)


HIGHPEN=x (256)

    Specifies the highest pen to use.  A value of 4 or 8 is useful for cross-computer displaying.


LOWPRI=B (NO)

    Turn this on to allow Picticon to run at -1 priority.  Usefull for background processing of many images.


MAXIWIDTH=x (128) MAXIHEIGHT=x (100)

    This is the workspace you wish to allocate to the processing engine.  It ranges from 50 to 1000 in size.  If you specify too small of a number, your icons may come out chopped off.  The default values Usually work fine.


PIC_X_POS=x (0) PIC_Y_POS=x (0) PIC_X_SIZE=x (size of buffer (128)) PIC_Y_SIZE=x (size of buffer (100))

    Creates a rectangle to place the scaled image into.  This can be used along with BACKGROUND_ICON to create frames.  See my examples.  Also, see the CENTER tooltype.


QUIET=B (NO)

    Turns off all status output, including messages and the status window.  Not tested much, so take care.


SHOWSIZE_NORMAL=B (NO) This overrides:  SHOWSIZE_OUTLINE=B (NO)

    The size text can be 1 of three styles.  It defaults to a shadow look, but a normal font or outline style can be specified.  NORMAL overrides OUTLINE.  Use OUTLINE if you expect the text to be displayed over a confusing background.


SHOWSIZE_TALL=B (NO)

    Tells the show size renderer to use the 8 pixel high font instead of the 6 pixel high.  Useful for interlaced displays.


SHOWSIZE_X=x (no display) SHOWSIZE_Y=y (no display)

    Will display the image size using one of two built in fonts.  These coordinates specify the upper-left position, not the baseline.  The height is 6 unless SHOWSIZE_TALL is turned on, in which case it's 8.  Use a X coordinate of -1 to center the display under the scaled image.


TEMPLATE_ICON=$ ('ENV:sys/def_picture') then,
                ('ENV:sys/def_project') then,
                (default project icon supplied by Workbench)

    Names a icon to get tooltypes and positions from.  Only the "meat" is used, not the image.  To specify an image, see the tooltype BACKGROUND_ICON.

@node "Bugs" "Known Bugs"

Known Bugs

    (1) ANNOYANCE A small bug that makes usage annoying.
    (2) VISUAL A bug which makes visual output unattractive.
    (3) GENERAL A general performance lack of a feature.
    (4) SERIOUS Will not crash the machine, but will require a reboot.
    (5) CRITICAL This is a spectacular crash.

  (2) If your screen font is too wide, some text may be chopped off.  This window width is set at 400 pixels until I find a reasonable solution.

  (4) Sometimes the JPEG datatype will freeze and then refuse to respond to all future requests.  I'm not sure about the entire nature, but the only solution is a reboot.  It will affect *ALL* programs    afterwards, so it is probably the JPEG datatype's fault.  ?

      Sending the Picticon process a signal via XOper usually restarts the JPeg datatype.  Any good Amiga user will have XOper sitting on his/her hard drive.  Just send a $FFFFFFFF signal to Picticon's process.  Repeat if neccessary.

  (3) Any picture that's smaller than the domains (pic_x_size, pic_y_size) will be ignored by the aspect scaler.  This is not too bad, as small images don't scale well.

@node "todo" "Stuff to do"

To-do

    ?  Maybe a frame around the image, to distinguish it from the background?

    ?  A GUI preference program/window to make easy option changes?

@node "QA" "Q&A"

Questions and Answers (Q&A)


    Q - When loading JPegs, it takes an awfully long time...

    A - JPegs are slow, even on fast computers.  Just run them in the background (@{"LOWPRI   tooltype" link "Tooltypes" 0}) and do something else.  (Wow, multitasking.)

    ps:  Most of the previous Q&A were fixed/added for this version!

Iconian

A great (IMHO) icon editor that deserves a look at.  Features abound:

                       Features of Iconian v1.98

  Support for sizable windows and custom fonts.
  Multiple undos
  Appwindows
  Custom magnification levels
  Upto 256 colors
  3.x palette sharing
  RGB color editing
  Integer scaling of oversized brushes
  Optional remapping of IFFs to screen colors
  Can save 8 plane icons which stay "normal" regardless of screen depth.
  Full range of drawing tools including beveled boxes
  Recolors 1.3 icons
  Clipboard support
  Extensive keyboard support
  Ability to cut and paste brushes
  Drawing with text, including selectable font and styles
  100% system supported, no reqtools/explode/iff/powerpacker required

Look for it on Aminet in the gfx/edit directory.  It requires OS 3.x.
