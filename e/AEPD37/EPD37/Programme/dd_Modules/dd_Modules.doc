NAME

  dd_modules -- e class implementation sources

AUTHOR

  Leon Woestenberg of Digital Disturbance (Email: leon@stack.urc.tue.nl)

REQUIREMENTS

  AmigaE 3.2a or better.

DESCRIPTION

  This is a part of some e class implementations that I have in
  development for use in my (future) programs. These are the ones
  that actually are functioning.

BACKGROUND

  These sources are released to be shared amongst E programmers and
  to help develop a public pool with e classes that can be used as
  building blocks for applications. Motivation for release was the
  Amiga E Object Oriented Project.

NOTES

   Programming OO objects is one thing, defining an abstract tree
   is another. I find it very hard to determine how to build the tree
   and how to implement inheritance, instances instead of classes etc.
   The tree above is more or less random. Any help on this is welcome.

   Some classes are overprotected for programmer fools; it is filled
   with pointer NIL checks and destructor related stuff. In a more
   definite version, I throw these out, and assume everyone calls
   a class destructor instead of doing CleanUp() or similars.
