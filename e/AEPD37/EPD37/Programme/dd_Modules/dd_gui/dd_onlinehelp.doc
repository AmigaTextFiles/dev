NAME

  dd_onlinehelp.m -- module for context sensitive online help

AUTHOR

  Leon Woestenberg of Digital Disturbance (Email: leon@stack.urc.tue.nl)

REQUIREMENTS

  Requires the amigaguide.library v34 (or later) to be installed.

DESCRIPTION

  The dd_onlinehelp module is an easy way to add online help features to
  your window applications programs, in a somewhat object oriented way.
  It is context sensitive; a help item is shown that corresponds to the
  current application context, i.e. a window, a gadget, a menu item etc.

FEATURES

  A base layer to add online help features to your applications, a thing
  that should be supported by a good application. Context sensitivity
  fully supported.

METHODS

  new -- construct a class instance

    SYNOPSIS
      instance.new(guidefile,arexxname,basename,contextlist)

    INPUTS
      guidefile (PTR TO CHAR) -- name of AmigaGuide database file.
      arexxname (PTR TO CHAR) -- name of AmigaGuide client's ARexx port.
      basename (PTR TO CHAR) -- bare name of the calling application.
      contextlist (PTR TO LONG) -- NIL terminated list with strings, each
        corresponding with the node names in the amigaguide.

    RESULT
       Returns FALSE if the construction failed.

  setcontext -- set current user context

    SYNOPSIS
      instance.setcontext(indexnumber)

    FUNCTION
      This method just sets the current user context. Advised usage is
      to update this every time a user enters a new context, i.e.
      activates a window, points at a gadget, pulls down a menu etc.

    INPUTS

      indexnumber (LONG) -- The index number (0...) of the context
        you want to set. The index is used to search the context list as
        defined in the new() method.

    RESULT
       No results.

  help -- display help on current context

    SYNOPSIS
      instance.help()

    FUNCTION
      This method displays help on the current user context. Advised
      usage is when the user selected 'Help...' from a pulldown menu,
      pressed the HELP key, or something similar.

      Note that you have to keep the context up-to-date using setcontext()
      during program run, otherwise the user might get false help texts
      when he or she needs it, which lead to confusion.

    RESULT
       No results.

   signalmask -- returns the signal to wait for

    SYNOPSIS
      instance.signalmask()

    FUNCTION
      Returns the signalmask your program should Wait() for. When there
      is a signal, you must call the handle() method. You may not act
      on this signal yourself.

    RESULT
      A 32 bit mask indicating which signal is reserved for amigaguide
      communication.

   handle -- handles amigaguide messages

    SYNOPSIS
      instance.handle()

    FUNCTION
      Handles amigaguide messages from the amigaguide server process.

    RESULT
       No results.

TODO

  - Make the interface more standard and open for feature enhancements.
  - Also, I would like to know how to detect when an AmigaGuide online help
  database is closed by the user. There seems to be no message for that?
