Hello, all E-ers.
Would You like to debug Your program directly from CED? I do.
Here are two files needed for this. They are *both* necessary.
All You have to do is to copy them to e:rexx and install the
Edebug.rexx in CED (Special/ DOS/Arexx Interface/ Install...).
Why can't it be one file?
The EDBG needs the debugged file to be in the CURRENT directory.
I don't know why, but it was impossible to change the current
directory from the ARexx script. I tried

ADDRESS COMMAND
'cd ' path

but it didn't work. So it had to be done in a separate script
file. Maybe it's not very professional, but it works.
BTW, if someone knows WHY the cd command doesn't work in the
ARexx-CED script, please email me and try to explain (I'm not
very good in ARexx...).

WARNING: Use at Your OWN risk. This script cannot do
any harm to Your system or Your sources, but...

PS Of course You have to have the 3.1a version, which contains
the EDBG.
