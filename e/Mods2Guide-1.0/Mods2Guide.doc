                            ---------------

    This is a simple program that will convert the contents of the Amiga E
    "Modules" directory into an AmigaGuide file, for easy reference.

    The program may be run from a Shell or Workbench.
    Just enter "Mods2Guide", or double-click the icon.

    Requirements:
    * "Emodules:" must be assigned to the directory containing the modules
    * "ShowModule" must be in your search path
    * The (included) PD library "rexxapp.library" (and a couple of other
        standard AmigaDos libraries) must be in Libs:
    * RexxMast (ARexx) must be running
    * You will need about 750K of free RAM.

    The two main advantages of this program are:

    1.  It should also work for any future revisions of the Modules
        directory, and

    2.  It will not be necessary to distribute a 260K+ AmigaGuide
        document, just a < 9K program, as everyone will be able to
        create their own AmigaGuide document.

    It would be more appropriate to have this program written in E.
    I am just starting to explore E, and hope to do that shortly.
    Thanks to Wouter for a great job!
