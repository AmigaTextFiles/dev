@Node What " Introduction"


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Since the Amiga_E language in now freeware and at the moment (and during the last years) I've been too short on time to improve ECT *and* i didn't got any registration - that's was also important :| - I've decided to release the full version of this program as freeware, but there will be (very likely) no futher improvements, maybe only a few bug fixing perhaps.
    Still, if you're feeling generous, be my guest ...
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

      As you surely know, the Amiga_E is a case sensitive programming language so @{B}E-Case Tool (ECT)@{UB} born (a long, long time ago), because I would like to type in Amiga_E always in lower case, since I @{" was " link Unix} very lazy to keep hitting always the [Shift] key 8-) .


      So, ECT tries to make the Amiga_E case insensitive ...
      What does this means ??


      Well, it allows you to write code like this :

            proc main()
            writef('boo !')
            endproc

      and it will be translated by magic in to the E standard :

            PROC main()
            WriteF('boo !')
            ENDPROC

Wow ! Isn't that great ?! At least I think so.

And does it *really* works ?
Well @{" ... " link Limitations}
@EndNode
@Node Limitations " Limitations"


      Well, it's very difficult (impossible ?) to turn a case dependent language like Amiga_E into an 100% insensible one.
So, you still have to obey the following rules :(

Errh ... See also the @{" Bugs "link Bugs} section ... 

      * All assembly instructions must be typed in UPPER case;

      * Variables cannot have the same name of E statements or instructions;
         ( like defining the following : DEF write )   @{" HINT " link Salvation}

      * All constants must stay in UPPER case too;

      * Module calls must be also typed as previously;

@Node Bugs " Bugs "


      There are some know bugs :


       BUG: » typing 'new' is always converted into 'NEW'
  SOLUTION:    type 'New' when you want New() or 'NEW' for the other case

       BUG: » typing 'raise' is always converted into 'RAISE'
  SOLUTION:    type 'Raise' when you want Raise() or 'RAISE' for the other

       BUG: » 'gadget' is not converted
  SOLUTION:     This one is on purpose, otherwise when you use the object
                gadget.xxx you would get Gadget.xxx ... The correct bug
                fixing to do would be to search for the string 'gadget.'and
                leave it alone, but again, this fixing would possibly never
                take place in the near future.
 
       BUG: » Let suppose you create a proc called 'intaaaa()'. It's
              then (bugly) converted into 'Intaaaa()' due to the similarity
              to Int() ... Argh !!!
  SOLUTION:    Preceed the name to your proc by a '_', that is, you would
               have to call it _intaaaa()

       BUG: » Using the character * inside a /* */ comment nest results in
		  a existencial confusion to ECT ...     
  SOLUTION:    Don't use it, please


Ok, I think it's all for now.

   Remember that the only job of ECT is to convert the case of the source, so if your program crashes and ECT seemed to work ok, be sure that you didn't do something illegal on E, 'cause my program don't do miracles ;)

   ECaseTool v1.01 never crashed during operation, but even if it crashes some day, remember that you first type and *save* your .ec source and then my program (ECT) converts it into .e, so you never loose your .ec source.

And if ECT keeps crashing with that .ec source, all you have to do is to manually retype it to the standard Amiga_E format ... Boring, but at least you don't loose your work !

@EndNode

@Node Usage " How do I "


Let's go straigth to the point:

      1· Write your program
      2· Save it with an .ec extension  (example: fly.ec)
      3· Use this program like this:

            ECT fly.ec

      Then, the ECT will create a fly.e file ('cased') and then invoke the EC itself (maybe it's wiser to put EC on the C: dir...)

      You may include some extra arguments that will be passed to the EC compiler. Example:

           ECT debug fly.ec



That's all!!

@Node Unix " The 'wonders' of Unix ..."


      When I was developing this program I also went to University to study Physics, so there was those ugly PC's running on Unix %(
And has you may know, the Unix is case dependent, so I got used to use the [Shift] key after all...

@Endnode

@Node Salvation " Salvation !"


      If you define a variable preceding its name by a '_' character, it will be valid !


      @{B}Example:@{UB}

            def and                 -> This is incorrect !

            def _and                -> This is valid 8-)


@Endnode
@Node info2 " More info "

      On this current version (v1.01), ECT recognizes all the stuff known by Amiga_E, that includes now the OS lib calls like 'DisplayBeep' or 'ChangeMode', etc ... Well, at least it should; If you find some function that isn't recognized, you must type EXACTLY it (that is, using upper and lower case as you'll have to do using Amiga_E before ECaseTool).

      Please note that *all* MODULE calls, such as 'AddConfigDev' on expansion.m or others, still aren't supported - they're a lot, so it would be very demanding (slow!) for ECT !

      Speaking on slowness, I was surprised to see that I didn't found any noticeable slowdown with this full version, comparing with the previous (which hadn't without support for the OS lib calls) ... At least on a 68030 running at 50Mhz. OK, that makes a me a nice programmer ?!

@Endnode

@Node Speed " Speed matters ..."


      Strangly enougth, ECT v1.0ß was programmed in Amiga_E, and at the moment I didn't use any assembly routines on it. *Maybe* in the future (and if I got enough registrations ;) ) I'll do that it.
