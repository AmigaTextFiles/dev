Calendar PLUGIN
---------------
Draws a calendar of a month and allows a day to be selected.  Uses the
'calendar.gadget' which needs to be in the normal place of libs:gadgets/
(usually libs: is also assigned to sys:classes/, and .gadget files should
be stored in the sys:classes/gadgets/ directory).

Constructors:

    calendar(date:PTR TO clockdata,resizex=FALSE,resizey=FALSE,
             disabled=FALSE)
        date     -> The initial date selected
        resizex  -> Whether this gadget can resize in width
        resizey  -> Whether this gadget can resize in height
        disabled -> Whether this gadget is disabled

Destructor:

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Data (should be considered read-only, except as mentioned below):

    OBJECT calendar OF plugin
      date:PTR TO clockdata  -> Current date
      disabled               -> Disabled or enabled
    PRIVATE ...
    ENDOBJECT

New methods:

    setdate(date=NIL:PTR TO clockdata) -> Set the current date
    setdisabled(disabled=TRUE)         -> Disable/enable the gadget

    Note: if NIL if specified for setdate() then the current date will be
          used (in which case it's OK to edit the data in self.date just
          before calling setdate()).
    Note: it's up to you to make sure the dates you supply are sensible.

Action functions:

    Your action function will be called (or your action value returned by
    easygui()) in the following circumstances:
      o When one of the day buttons is pressed
        (the date will reflect the current state)

Exceptions:

    "cal" will be raised by the constructor if the .gadget file can't be
          opened.
    "cal" will be raised by the render() method if the gadget can't be
          created.
