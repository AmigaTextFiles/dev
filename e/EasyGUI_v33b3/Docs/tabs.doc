Tabs PLUGIN
-----------
Makes a set of tabs for page selection (most useful with changegui()).
Uses the 'tabs.gadget' which needs to be in the normal place of
libs:gadgets/ (usually libs: is also assigned to sys:classes/, and .gadget
files should be stored in the sys:classes/gadgets/ directory).

Constructors:

    tabs(tabslist:PTR TO tablabel,current=0,max=TRUE,disabled=FALSE)
        tabslist -> The list of labels to use
        current  -> The initial tab selected
        max      -> Whether each tab has the width of the widest tab
        disabled -> Whether this gadget is disabled

    Note: the gadget will *conditionally* resize in width.

Destructor:

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Data (should be considered read-only):

    OBJECT tabs OF plugin
      current   -> Currently selected tab
      disabled  -> Disabled or enabled
    PRIVATE ...
    ENDOBJECT

New methods:

    setcurrent(x)              -> Set the current selected tab
    setdisabled(disabled=TRUE) -> Disable/enable the gadget

Action functions:

    Your action function will be called (or your action value returned by
    easygui()) in the following circumstances:
      o When one of the tabs is pressed
        (current will indicate the selected tab)

Exceptions:

    "tabs" will be raised by the constructor if the .gadget file can't be
           opened.
    "tabs" will be raised by the render() method if the gadget can't be
           created.
