GradientSlider PLUGIN
---------------------
The silder that goes with the colorwheel from the Palette prefs program.
Uses the 'gradientslider.gadget' which needs to be in the normal place of
libs:gadgets/ (usually libs: is also assigned to sys:classes/, and .gadget
files should be stored in the sys:classes/gadgets/ directory).

Constructors:

    gradient(vert=FALSE,curval=0,rel=5,pens=NIL:PTR TO INT,disabled=FALSE)
        vert     -> Whether this gadget is vertical or horizontal
        curval   -> The current value of the slider
        rel      -> The relative size (height if vert, width if not)
        pens     -> The pen array used in the gradient (ends with -1)
        disabled -> Whether this gadget is disabled

Destructor:

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Data (should be considered read-only, except as mentioned below):

    OBJECT button OF plugin
      curval          -> The current value of the slider (0 to $FFFF)
      pens:PTR TO INT -> The current pen array for the gradient
      disabled        -> Disabled or enabled
    PRIVATE ...
    ENDOBJECT

New methods:

    setcurval(x)                 -> Set the current value of the slider
    setpens(pens=NIL:PTR TO INT) -> Change the pen array
    setdisabled(disabled=TRUE)   -> Disable/enable the gadget

    Note: if NIL is specified for setpens() then the current pen array
          will be used (in which case it's OK to edit the data in self.pens
          just before calling setpens()).

Action functions:

    Your action function will be called (or your action value returned by
    easygui()) in the following circumstances:
      o When the slider is moved or released.

Exceptions:

    "grad" will be raised by the constructor if the .gadget file can't be
           opened.
    "grad" will be raised by the render() method if the gadget can't be
           created.
