ColorWheel PLUGIN
-----------------
The famous colorwheel from the Palette prefs program.  Uses the
'colorwheel.gadget' which needs to be in the normal place of libs:gadgets/
(usually libs: is also assigned to sys:classes/, and .gadget files should
be stored in the sys:classes/gadgets/ directory).

Constructors:

    colorwheel(rgb:PTR TO colorwheelrgb,hsb=NIL:PTR TO colorwheelhsb,
               box=FALSE,disabled=FALSE)
        rgb      -> The initial value as RGB
        hsb      -> The initial value as HSB
        box      -> Whether to put a bevel box around the wheel
        disabled -> Whether this gadget is disabled

Destructor:

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Data (should be considered read-only, except as mentioned below):

    OBJECT colorwheel OF plugin
      rgb:PTR TO colorwheelrgb  -> Current RGB value
      hsb:PTR TO colorwheelhsb  -> Current HSB value
      disabled                  -> Disabled or enabled
    PRIVATE ...
    ENDOBJECT

    Only one of rgb and hsb will be valid at any time (the invalid one will
    be NIL), depending on which system you used when you last set the
    current value.

New methods:

    setrgb(rgb=NIL)            -> Set the current value using RGB
    sethsb(hsb=NIL)            -> Set the current value using HSB
    getrgb(rgb)                -> Get the current RGB value
    gethsb(hsb)                -> Get the current HSB value
    setdisabled(disabled=TRUE) -> Disable/enable the gadget

    Note: using setrgb()/sethsb() changes the system that the colorwheel
          uses, so after a setrgb() the hsb element will be invalid (NIL).
    Note: if NIL is specified for setrgb() or sethsb() then the current one
          will be used (in which case it's OK to edit the data in self.rgb
          or self.hsb just before calling setXXX()).
    Note: getrgb()/gethsb() fill in the colorwheelrgb/hsb that you supply
          with the current colorwheel value, but do not change the system
          that's being used.

Action functions:

    Your action function will be called (or your action value returned by
    easygui()) in the following circumstances:
      o When the pointer is moved.

Exceptions:

    "colw" will be raised by the constructor if the .gadget file can't be
           opened.
    "colw" will be raised by the render() method if the gadget can't be
           created.
