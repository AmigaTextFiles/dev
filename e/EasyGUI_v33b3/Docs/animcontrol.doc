AnimControl PLUGIN
------------------
Consists of play, rewind, fast forward, stop and frame number gadgets.
Uses the 'tapedeck.gadget' which needs to be in the normal place of
libs:gadgets/ (usually libs: is also assigned to sys:classes/, and .gadget
files should be stored in the sys:classes/gadgets/ directory).

Constructors:

    animcontrol(frame=0,frames=8,play=FALSE,disabled=FALSE)
        frame    -> The first frame (=position of slider)
        frames   -> The number of frames (=extent of slider)
        play     -> Whether the play button is pressed initially
        disabled -> Whether this gadget is disabled

Destructor:

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Data (should be considered read-only):

    OBJECT animcontrol OF plugin
      frame     -> Current frame number
      mode      -> Current mode
      disabled  -> Disabled or enabled
    PRIVATE ...
    ENDOBJECT

    The mode is taken from 'gadgets/tapedeck'.  It will be:
      o BUT_PLAY if playing
      o BUT_STOP if stopped
      o BUT_FORWARD if fast forward is being held
      o BUT_REWIND if rewind is being held

New methods:

    setframe(n)                -> Set the current frame number
    setplay(play=TRUE)         -> Set play/stop mode
    setdisabled(disabled=TRUE) -> Disable/enable the gadget

Action functions:

    Your action function will be called (or your action value returned
    by easygui()) in the following circumstances:
      o The rewind or fast forward button has been pressed
        (mode will be BUT_FORWARD or BUT_REWIND)
      o The rewind or fast forward button has been released
        (mode will be BUT_STOP)
      o The play button has been pressed (and released)
        (mode will be BUT_PLAY)
      o The stop button has been pressed (and released)
        (mode will be BUT_STOP)
      o The frame slider has been moved
        (mode will be BUT_STOP, frame may have changed)

Exceptions:

    "anim" will be raised by the constructor if the .gadget file can't
           be opened.
    "anim" will be raised by the render() method if the gadget can't
           be created.
