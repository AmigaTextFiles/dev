LED PLUGIN
----------
Draws pairs of digits to look like LED displays (such as clocks).  Uses the
'led.image' which needs to be in the normal place of libs:images/ (usually
libs: is also assigned to sys:classes/, and .image files should be stored
in the sys:classes/images/ directory).

Constructors:

    led(pairs=2,values=NIL,colon=FALSE,signed=FALSE,negative=FALSE,pen=1)
        pairs    -> The number of pairs of digits
        values   -> The values (one value per pair of digits)
        colon    -> Whether the colon between pairs is displayed
        signed   -> Whether use will be made of the leading minus sign
        negative -> Whether the leading minus sign is on or off
        pen      -> The pen (colour) of the LED

Destructor:

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Data (should be considered read-only, except as mentioned below):

    OBJECT led OF plugin
      pairs
      values:PTR TO INT
      colon
      signed
      negative
      pen
    PRIVATE ...
    ENDOBJECT

New methods:

    redisplay()  -> Redraw according to new values

    Note: it is OK to change the public data just before calling
          redisplay() (and this is the only real use for redisplay()).

Action functions:

    Ignored.

Exceptions:

    "led" will be raised by the constructor if the .image file can't be
          opened.
    "led" will be raised by the render()/redisplay() methods if the image
          can't be created.
