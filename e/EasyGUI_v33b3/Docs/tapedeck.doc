TapeDeck PLUGIN
---------------
Consists of play, rewind, fast forward, stop and pause gadgets.  Uses the
'tapedeck.gadget' which needs to be in the normal place of libs:gadgets/
(usually libs: is also assigned to sys:classes/, and .gadget files should
be stored in the sys:classes/gadgets/ directory).

Constructors:

    tapedeck(mode=BUT_STOP,paused=FALSE,disabled=FALSE)
        mode     -> The current mode (see below)
        paused   -> Whether the pause button is pressed initially
        disabled -> Whether this gadget is disabled

Destructor:

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Data (should be considered read-only):

    OBJECT tapedeck OF plugin
      mode      -> Current mode
      paused    -> Paused or not
      disabled  -> Disabled or enabled
    PRIVATE ...
    ENDOBJECT

    The mode is taken from 'gadgets/tapedeck'.  It will be:
      o BUT_PLAY if playing
      o BUT_STOP if stopped
      o BUT_FORWARD if fast forwarding
      o BUT_REWIND if rewinding

New methods:

    setmode(mode=BUT_STOP)     -> Set the current mode
    setpaused(paused=TRUE)     -> Set paused on or off
    setdisabled(disabled=TRUE) -> Disable/enable the gadget

Action functions:

    Your action function will be called (or your action value returned by
    easygui()) in the following circumstances:
      o When one of the buttons is pressed
        (mode and paused will reflect the current state)

Exceptions:

    "tape" will be raised by the constructor if the .gadget file can't be
           opened.
    "tape" will be raised by the render() method if the gadget can't be
           created.
