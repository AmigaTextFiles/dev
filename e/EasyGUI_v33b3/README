Short: EasyGUI v3.3b.3 (multiple windows!)
Type: dev/e

New v3.3b.3 EasyGUI package
===========================

(v3.3b.3 is a minor update that fixes a bug with AppWindow messages
that crept in under the guise of a safety feature in v3.3b...)

Re-read Docs/EasyGUI.doc!

For the impatient, here is the big news:

- MAJOR CHANGE: made the main functions use a taglist for their optional
  arguments (it was getting a bit ridiculous...).  This gives a bit more
  flexibility for the programmer and makes for much more readable code, so
  I'm afraid it was inevitable.  To ease the change-over a bit there is an
  example module which gives the old style versions of the functions (just
  for EasyGUI.m; you can do your own for EasyGUI_lite.m).
- MAJOR ADDITION: support for multi-window GUIs.  This is via the
  multiinit(), addmultiA(), multimessage(), cleanmulti() and checkmulti()
  functions.  The new scheme shares message ports, and efficiently
  dispatches on the message data.  This is *massively* more efficient than
  using the old scheme (OR-ing the signal masks of each window), and
  effectively removes the limit of windows that a GUI can use.


Installing the modules
----------------------
Copy the files from the sub-directories of the Modules directory to the
same place in your emodules: directory.  Note: there are some updates to
the typed modules of the v3.2a distribution included.

Installing the .gadget and .image files
---------------------------------------
Copy the .gadget and .image files from the sub-directories of the Classes
directory to the same place in your sys:classes directory (or at least,
somewhere so that libs:gadgets/x.gadget and libs:images/x.image find the
appropriate files).

PLUGINS
-------
There are now lots of examples of PLUGINs with full source code and some
documentation.  Hopefully this will provoke some more interest in this
area...  Also, there is a simplified way of using GadTools gadgets as
PLUGINs, via gtrender().

Test files
----------
There are several test files showing how to use the new features and new
PLUGINs (in Src/EasyGUI/).

Feedback

Please let me have some...
