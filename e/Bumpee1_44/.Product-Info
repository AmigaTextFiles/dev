Smart revision bumper for Amiga E programs
.description
Bumpee is a simple-to-use revision control program for your E sources.
The use of a standarized versionstring, introduced by Commodore-Amiga
with AmigaOS 2.04, offers a neat way to keep track of the executables
generated during program development. These are a must for AmigaOS
2.04+ programs.
