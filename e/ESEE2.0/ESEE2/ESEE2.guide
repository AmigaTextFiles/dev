@{b}ESEE (E Source Editor Environment) Guide@{ub}

This guide applies to the unfinished ESEE release 2.0, that is considered
'not-even-beta' or better 'unfinished'. If you're not familiar with the
Amiga E programming language, or with the programmer's editor GoldED, I
suggest you throw away this archive, and wait for the full version to be
released.

If you are familiar with ESEE 1.x and the software mentioned above, you
might want to install this fully reconstructed ESEE configuration to
edit, compile, profile and debug your E sources on the fly, with a
maximum level of convenience.

@{b}ESEE Notes@{ub}

This unfinished version has been released because several ESEE 1.x users
wanted so (Your Wish is my command - NOT!). It comes without any
documentation (except this small guide), installation script or whatever.
It consist of the hard core only, needed to configure GoldED to suit your
wishes.

For now, you'll have to do this yourself...

You NEED GoldED 1.1 and Amiga E 3.x for the following installation:

1) Backup or rename your current configuration of GoldED, to be found
   as ENVARC:GoldED/GoldED.prefs. Copy the supplied ESEE prefs over it.

3) Copy the directories to your Prefs/ and GoldED: paths.
4) Reboot and start GoldED with this new configuration.

5) If needed, set up the reference system to reference to the ModulesTexts
   using 'Configuration/References...'.

   That should be all fooks!

@node distribution "ESEE Distribution"

                         @{b}ESEE Distribution@{ub}

ESEE is freely distributable and will always stay that way. Note that
this only applies to the configuration and support of which ESEE exists,
and @{b}NOT@{ub} to the programs 'GoldED' and 'AmigaE', which are in no way
connected to ESEE concerning copyrights and/or distributability.

Only the complete ESEE archive may be copied or uploaded. Once you have
obtained ESEE you may, of course, alter it fully to your own needs. But
altered or single files may not be spread under the name 'ESEE'.

Thanks for living up to these rules!
