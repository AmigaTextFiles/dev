                                                        
                           Mods2Guide V2.1                (August 13, 1995)
                           ---------------
    General:
    -------
    This is a simple program that will convert the contents of the Amiga E
    "Modules" directory into an AmigaGuide file, for easy reference.
    This AmigaGuide file will contain the expanded ascii contents of the
    Emodules: directory.  Two hypertext files will be created:
    E_Modules.guide and E_Modules.index.  Keep these 2 files together in the
    same directory.

    Since this program is only of use to E programmers, it is designed to
    be run from a Shell.  However, if you are happy with the default values,
    just double-click the icon.  "Mods2Guide INFO" gives a brief description
    of the requirements and command line arguments.  Command line arguments
    are optional - all options have defaults.

    <Control - C> will halt the program at any time.


    Requirements:
    ------------
    *  "Emodules:" must be assigned to the directory containing the modules.
    *  Kickstart 37 (Workbench 2.04) or later.
    *  When I ran this version of Mods2Guide on the Modules directory of
       the Amiga E V3.2a distribution package, about 900K of free RAM where
       required to create the files.  This included 374893 bytes for the
       E_Modules.guide file, and 21548 bytes for E_Modules.index (using the
       default settings).  If your Emodules: directory is larger, you will
       need even more.


    Limitations:
    -----------
    The program will exit gracefully if:
    *  There are directories nested inside of directories.
    *  There are more than 98 directories.
    *  There are more than 75 files in any directory (except the
         root directory).

    If for any reason Wouter should change the output format of his
    ShowModule program, this version of Mods2Guide will probably no longer
    function properly.


    Mods2Guide V1.1:
    ---------------
    If you have a problem with Requirements/Limitations above, you might
    try V1.1 of Mods2Guide.  This is an ARexx program that does exactly
    the same job, (except that it does not create the ".index" file), but
    quite a bit slower.  The requirements are the same, except that it
    requires an additional PD library (see the docs).

    It's only limitation is that there can be no nested directories.


    Command Line Template:
    ---------------------
    The command line template of Mods2Guide V2.1 is as follows:

        Mods2Guide  INFO/S, S=SMDIR/K, H=HEIGHT/N, ND/N, NF/N, NR/N


    Argument Description:
    --------------------
      INFO    Displays some basic information.
      SMDIR   The path to the directory containing ShowModule.  The default
              is that ShowModule is already in your search path.  If used,
              the path must end in a ":" or a "/".
      HEIGHT  The height, in rows, of the created AmigaGuide window.
              The default is 16, which nicely fills a 200 pixel high window.
              A height of 5 will be used if a number < 5 is entered.
      ND      Number of directory names placed on 1 line.  These are the
              names in the main (Contents) window.  The default is 4.
      NF      Number of filenames placed on 1 line.  These are the filenames
              shown when you click on a directory name.  The default is 2.
      NR      Number of root-filenames placed on 1 line.  The default is 3.

      The ND, NF and NR only pertain to the "E_Modules.guide" file.  Entries
      in the "E_Modules.index" file are always 1 to a line.


      Example:
      -------
      1> Run Mods2Guide  S=DH0:AmigaE/Bin/  NR=1

      will specifically look for ShowModule in the "DH0:AmigaE/Bin/"
      directory, and create the "E_Modules.guide" file with the directory
      names placed 4 across, the nested filenames 2 across, but the root
      filenames only 1 to a line, similar to the "E_Modules.index" file.


    E_Modules.guide:
    ---------------
    The "Contents" page of this file has a gadget for every directory
    in "Emodules:", plus another labeled "Modules in the Root Directory".  

    Clicking on one of the directory gadgets will display a list of
    every module in that directory.  Clicking on one of the module names
    will show the expanded ASCII contents of that module.

    Clicking on the "Modules in the Root Directory" gadget will display a
    list of every module in the root directory.  Clicking on one of the
    module names will show the expanded ASCII contents of that module.


    E_Modules.index:
    ---------------
    If you click on the AmigaGuide "Index" gadget, when E_Modules.guide is
    loaded, and the E_Modules.index file is in the same directory, that file
    will be loaded.  This displays an alphabetical list of ALL the modules,
    and also shows that module's parent directory.  Clicking on one of the
    module names will show the expanded ASCII contents of that module.


    Advantages:
    ----------
    The two main advantages of this program are:

    1.  It should also work for any future revisions of the Modules
        directory (subject to the limitations above), and

    2.  It will not be necessary to distribute a 350K+ AmigaGuide
        document, just a < 15K program, as everyone will be able to
        create their own AmigaGuide document.


    Don't Have Room to Keep These Files?:
    ------------------------------------
    I have written another program, similar to this, for those who do not
    have disk space to keep these large AmigaGuide documents around.
    "SeeModule" is sort of a GUI for ShowModule.  It creates a file that
    looks almost identical to E_Modules.guide (or E_Modules.index, your
    option), and also works the same way.  The difference is that the
    modules have NOT been pre-expanded - this is done individually, as they
    are selected.  Therefore, the only file you need to have handy is about
    20K in size.  Users with hard drives will probably prefer Mods2Guide.


    Problems/Questions:
    ------------------
    This is the first program I have written in E, so bear with me.

    Thanks to Wouter for a great job in forming the language.  Thanks also
    to Barry Wills and Jaco Schoonen for their help in the development of
    this program.
