INTRODUCTION

  The Amiga is a multitasking computer, meaning that different tasks run
  at the same time, seen from the user point of view. A process is an
  extension of a task, as it has some DOS properties (standard input,
  current directory, etc.) as well. An Amiga E compiled executable is a
  process. Sometimes, a program may need to do two things at a time, for
  example a texteditor may print a text while the user is editing another
  text. This is where threading comes in.

DESCRIPTION

  Threading basically means that a program adds a task to the system to
  perform an asynchronous operation, while the program itself can continue
  doing something else. A thread is a task that is related to its main
  task, and often depends upon the main task, as they often share resources
  or data, and communicate with eachother.

  These sources show the very basics of adding threading to your E programs.

BUGS

  Under crisis circumstances, these examples will probably fail.

TODO

  Improve crisis-situation behaviour. Also write an application class with
  threading features.
