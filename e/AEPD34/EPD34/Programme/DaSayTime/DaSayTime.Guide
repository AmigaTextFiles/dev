 Here are the defines for the thirty different phrases the program
 needs.  If you want to substitute your own voice for mine, I suggest
 you record the following lines:

     The time is eight o'clock exactly.
     The time is eight oh-eight and one second.
     The time is eight oh-eight and eight seconds.
     One.  Two.  Three.  Four.  Five.  Six.  Seven.  Eight.  Nine.  Ten.
     Eleven.  Twelve.  Thirteen.  Fourteen.  Fifteen.  Sixteen.  Seventeen.
     Eighteen.  Nineteen.  Twenty.  Thirty.  Forty.  Fifty.

 Then use Sun's sound demo to dissect the lines into separate files.
 It's not really that much work, it took me about an hour.

@NODE WAZZIT "Short description of the procudt"
@{B}Short description@{UB}

"DaSayTime" is a very small command which uses the audio-device to play a
combination of samples depending on the time of day. In other words: It
simply _says_ what time it is! And no! ..not that husky robotic C= voice, but
@{"this voice!" SYSTEM "dasaytime sounds/ H"}

@ENDNODE

@NODE DOC "Documentation"
@{B}Documentation@{UB}

The original idea behind (Da)Saytime was spawned in the head of Jef Poskanzer
in 1990. He wrote it for the SPARCstations, but it has now been "ported" to
your wonderful AMIGA. You got to use Kickstart 2+

"DaSayTime" is a very small command which uses the audio-device to play a
combination of samples depending on the time of day. In other words: It
simply _says_ what time it is! And no! ..not that husky robotic C= voice, but
@{"this voice!" SYSTEM "dasaytime sounds/ H"} which belongs to the original
author.

You can very easily substitute the voice with your own. Just record new
samples and make sure they have got the same names as the ones provided in
this package. The samples have to be converted to raw - if you're lacking a
tool to do this simply snip off the first lines until you reach the word BODY.
Cut all the text above, and including, BODY, and save the file.

@{B}OPTIONS:@{UB}

DaSayTime <P=PATH> [S=SAMPLERATE] [V=VOLUME] [H=12H]

       @{I}P=<PATH>@{UI} : Name the place the soundfiles are located. I.e:
                  DaSayTime Work:Music/DaSayTimeSounds/

 @{I}S=<SAMPLERATE>@{UI} : The chosen samplerate. The default rate is 8000
                  hz. This enables you to use your created new
                  samples even though they might be another
                  samplerate. Nice right?

        @{I}H=<12H>@{UI} : DaSayTime <PATH> E will switch from 24 hour clock
                  to 12 hour clock. I.e (This might not be a good
                  example *grin*, if the outcome is similar please
                  try again within 12 hours):

                  @{"   With H option" SYSTEM "dasaytime sounds/ H"}
                  @{"Without H option" SYSTEM "dasaytime sounds/"}

     @{I}V=<VOLUME>@{UI} : This enables you to set the desired loudness of
                  output (Value 1-64, Default 64).


And that's it! Have fun using DaSayTime. Using it as a cronjob can be
recommended :)
