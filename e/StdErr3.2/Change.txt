I am an idiot.

My gravest apologies to those people who might have been
using StdErr out there, who were probably unaware of this
rather stupid thing I put in it where it has its own Version
string <sigh>.

This version has the version string stripped out, meaning
you may now include it without fear of your program coming
up with 'StdErr 3.1' when somewhat types 'Version
[progname]'.

This release is StdErr 3.2.
