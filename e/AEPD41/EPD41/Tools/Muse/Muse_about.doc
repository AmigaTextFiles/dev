What's Muse then?
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   Muse is an evolving project with its end goal being highly usable, user
configurable, interchangeable, extensible programs. This version is the
first step towards that goal and is aimed at programmers using the language
Amiga E. The system is a set of modules with the following features:

       The ability to define most multiply windowed interfaces (including
   menus, keyboard shortcuts etc), which can also be be script controlled
   via REXX, just by declaring them. The processing of all these many and
   varied inputs, however is via simple & standardised techniques.
      There are just two! The event processing system made available (the
   key technique); and the Virtual Visible Variable interface.

   It is designed to be efficent, flexible, fast, easy to useand ROBUST.
Later versions will add many, many more powerful concepts. Of course a
programming system is useless without documentation and examples. To that
aim this distribution includes:

   · A FULL tutorial taking you from the basic program of opening a window
     and cutomising it, all the way through to a paint program and a simple
     database.

   · The basic example's source code is made available in both an amigaguide
     form (for easy reference when using the tutorial) and as separate
     source files - for easy compilation.

   · A fully hypertexted on-line reference document - with plain text
     version for those who don't like hyper-text - which deals with every
     part of Muse from the syntax of minor parts to conceptual explainations
     of other major parts.

   · Two quick reference guides for day-to-day use containing the key
     information needed to use Muse to the full.


Also by the end of April there will be available (at _production_ cost)
a printed manual going into Muse in much greater depth than is possible
with on-line references including structural, (*similar* to JSP) and
conceptual (EER) diagrams. The purchase of which will enable a reduced
registration price when the registered version comes out in mid '96.

And as if all that wasn't enough, access to a World Wide Web page dedicated
to supporting Muse!

And unbelievably, you're getting all this power for FREE!


System Requirements
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 · An Amiga computer with version 2.04 upwards of the operating system.
 · A copy of AmigaE version 3.2 upwards REGISTERED. (code for as program
   using Muse irrelevant of _INTERFACE_ complexity is about 30K. A complex
   _PROGRAM_ *might* increase this!
That's it. As a general note it is wise to have a hard disk as well. (Not a
requirement for _Muse_ however!)


Distribution contents
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 · The main Muse module with all its related modules. (with partial docs for
   some of the support modules)
 · A comprehensive tutorial including the tutorial sources up to example 14b
   in a hypertexted for for ease of reference between the tutorial doc and
   the source.
 · Completely low-level tested demonstration programs as detailed above.
 · 52 Standard images for use in either gadgets or menu options supplied as
   icons for ease of editing (everyone has an icon editor!).
 · Comprehensive and concise forms of documentation of the system.


Installation
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
I assume AmigaE is set up correctly.
Copy the contents of the emodules directory to your EMODULES: directory.
Copy the contents of the libs directory to your LIBS: directory.
That's it! Quickest method is via the workbench's show all option!
