                                   NOTE
   
      Please excuse my uneven english, because it's my foreign language.
    But writing this documentation in portuguese would decrease the number
    of people who can understand the function of E-GUI and I hate portuguese
    descriptions of international spreaded material because of the
    non-technical character of my native language. Thanks in advance!

                                 REQUIREMENTS

      E-GUI was developed under OS3.0 with 2.x includes. It was tested
    both in Kickstart/WB 2.x and 3.0 with no problems nor enforcer hits.
    There is no reason why it shouldn't work under Kick1.3 but you will
    need the asl.library for your ROM version. I know that there is
    version for the Wb1.3 but as I didn't found it, I couldn't include it
    with this distribution archive.
      Also, E-GUI requires reqtools.library in your LIBS: directory. You
    can find this library in this pack. In the future, we can re-write
    E-GUI to use ONLY reqtools.library and therefore eliminate the need
    of asl.library. That would make a lot of 1.3 users happy. Anyway,
    if you dont have a 2.x> ROM yet, buy one! Its worth the money!

                              DETAILED DESCRIPTION

      There isn't much to say about E-GUI, running it is the best way to see
    what it does. With E-GUI you no longer need to use the 'E' in a Shell
    or CLI window. You can fully take benefits of the Workbench environment
    without loosing any 'E' features.

      Running E-GUI for the first time shows you a small window that opens
    itself at the bottom of your workbench screen. You can see six big
    Gadgets that represent the actions you can perform with the program.
    Some of those gadgets have also a buttom with a '*' inside (precognition
    rules) that will call a ASL filerequester to easy select your favorite
    tool. In most cases, you can also hand-edit the string gadgets your
    self.

      In all the situations, you can replace the sourcename by the %s
    variable that is auto-defined in the 'Pick' string gadget. Also,
    the .e extention is removed if you use %s in the 'Compile' or 'Debug'
    string gadgets. (i.e. CygnusEd %s -KeepIo).

      'Edit', 'Compile', 'Debug' and 'Execute' open an Output window just
    in case you need any "stdio".

      When you exit E-GUI, a configuration file will be saved in your
    current directory containing your favorite settings. This way, you
    can have diferent configurations for diferent situations. A personal
    opinion is to create a diferent drawer for each project and have
    E-GUI in it. If you dont want to spend too much disk space with a
    E-GUI for each source, write a Script that calls E-GUI from some
    directory and associate an Icon to it.

      Below the 'Execute' buttom, there is a small string gadget where you
    can write the program arguments that will be passed to the executable.

      Pressing 'Pick' will open a filerequester where you can select a
    new source to work with.

      Remember: Allways use .e extension in your sources.
