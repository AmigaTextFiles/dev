These programs demonstrate the use of Exec message ports for 
communication between related programs, and the use of a common
Intuition screen for display of images etc.

I've sprinkled a number or WriteF statements throuthout the
programs, to show at runtime what is happening. These statements
can of course be safely omitted if you want to use the programs
for a project of your own.

This suite is a skeleton for a larger program I am dreaming up.
It does not do anything useful as is, but it does work and can
be extended into anything you might want.

I impose no copyrights on these sources, as they were put 
together by blatantly copying from all over the place (i.e. the
Amiga-E distribution and AmiNet additions).

Use them as you like - I should like a short notice if you find
them useful or have suggestions for improvements.

[This is a suite of cooperating programs - couldn't think of a
 better name...]
