    NAME
	BGUI_AllocBitMap -- Allocate a BitMap.

	** V40 **

    SYNOPSIS
	bitmap = BGUI_AllocBitMap( width, height, depth, flags, friend )
	D0			   D0	  D1	  D2	 D3	A0

	struct BitMap *BGUI_AllocBitMap( ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG,
							     struct BitMap * )

    FUNCTION
	Allocates and initializes a BitMap structure and it's bitplanes. Under
	OS 3.0 or better  it  reverts  to  the	graphics.library/AllocBitMap()
	routine. On lower versions of the OS it will  allocate	and initialize
	the BitMap structure and bitplanes itself.

    INPUTS
	width	- The width in pixels of the desired BitMap.
	height	- The height in pixels of the desired BitMap.
	depth	- The number of bitplanes of the desired BitMap.
	flags	- See graphics.library/AllocBitMap().
	friend	- See graphics.library/AllocBitMap().

    RESULT
	A pointer to the allocated and initialized BitMap  structure  or  NULL
	in case of a failure.

    NOTES
	Under  OS  2.04  the  "friend" parameter has no meaning. The only flag
	available  under  OS 2.04  is  the BMF_CLEAR flag which will clear the
	bitplane data.

    BUGS
	None know.

bgui.library/BGUI_CreateRPortBitMap

    NAME
	BGUI_CreateRPortBitMap -- Create a RastPort and BitMap in one go.

	** V40 **

    SYNOPSIS
	rport = BGUI_CreateRPortBitMap( src, width, height, depth )
	D0				A0   D0     D1	    D2

	struct RastPort *BGUI_CreateRPortBitMap( struct RastPort *, ULONG,
								ULONG, ULONG )

    FUNCTION
	To  allocate  and  initialize  a RastPort and BitMap. The routine will
	setup the RastPort attributes according to  the  source  RastPort when
	available. If no  source  RastPort  is	made  available  the resulting
	RastPort is initialized by graphics.library/InitRastPort().

    INPUTS
	src	- A pointer to the source RastPort from  which	the attributes
		  for  the  created  RastPort  are copied.   When  this is not
		  specified  the  created  RastPort  is  initialized  with the
		  graphics.library/InitRastPort() routine.
	width	- The width in pixels of the BitMap attached to the RastPort.
	height	- The height in pixels of the BitMap attached to the RastPort.
	depth	- The  number  of  bitplanes  of  the  BitMap  attached to the
		  RastPort.

    RESULT
	A pointer to the created RastPort structure or NULL uppon failure.

    NOTES
	The created RastPort does not have a layer attached to it  so clipping
	is not possible. You are responsible that any rendering  which occures
	in the RastPort remains inside the RastPort bounds.

    BUGS
	None known.

bgui.library/BGUI_DoGadgetMethodA

    NAME
	BGUI_DoGadgetMethodA -- Invoke a method on a BOOPSI gadget.
	BGUI_DoGadgetMethod -- Varargs version.

    SYNOPSIS
	result = BGUI_DoGadgetMethodA( gad, win, req, msg )
	D0			       A0   A1	 A2   A3

	ULONG BGUI_DoGadgetMethodA( Object *, struct Window *,
						     struct Requester *, Msg )

	ULONG BGUI_DoGadgetMethod( Object *, struct Window *,
					      struct Requester *, ULONG, ... )

    FUNCTION
	To  invoke  a  method  on  a  BOOPSI  gadget simular to the DoMethod()
	function in  amiga.lib with the advantage that context information for
	the  gadget  is  included  in  the  method  by	means  of a GadgetInfo
	structure.

    INPUTS
	gad	- A  pointer  to  the  BOOPSI  gadget  on  which the method is
		  invoked.
	win	- A  pointer  to  the  window  on  which  the BOOPSI gadget is
		  located.
	req	- Normally a pointer to the  requester	on  which  the	BOOPSI
		  gadget is located. Since BGUI does not support  it's objects
		  on requesters you should put NULL here.
	msg	- A pointer to the message to send to the BOOPSI gadget.

    RESULT
	The  object  does  whatever  it needs to do which may include updating
	it's visuals. The return value is defined per-method.

    NOTES
	This function invokes the specified method with a  GadgetInfo  derived
	from the 'win' and 'req' pointers.  The  GadgetInfo  is  passed as the
	second parameter of the message, except for OM_NEW, OM_SET, OM_NOTIFY,
	and OM_UPDATE, where the GadgetInfo is passed as the third parameter.

	Custom	gadget implemetors should take note of this.  Always  put  the
	GadgetInfo in the second parameter of the message.

	In  the  versions  of  BGUI  preceeding  this  version	this  call was
	simulated on  OS 2.04  in  the	sence  that  BGUI  made the GadgetInfo
	structure itself when running under OS 2.04.  Currently BGUI let's the
	system build the GadgetInfo structure no matter what version of the OS
	is present.

	This  has  been  done by setting up a special gadgetclass on which the
	target object and method to send is set by doing  a  SetGadgetAttrs().
	The  class  then invokes  the method on  the  target  object using the
	GadgetInfo build by the SetGadgetAttrs() call. All of this is ofcourse
	transparent to the caller.

bgui.library/BGUI_RequestA

    NAME
	BGUI_RequestA -- Put up a requester.
	BGUI_Request -- Varargs version.

    SYNOPSIS
	gadid = BGUI_RequestA( win, req, args )
	D0		       A0   A1	 A2

	ULONG BGUI_RequestA( struct Window *, struct bguiRequest *, ULONG * )

	gadid = BGUI_Request( win, req, arg1, ... )

	ULONG BGUI_Request( struct Window *, struct bguiRequest *, ULONG, ... )

    FUNCTION
	To  put  up  a	requester.   It  is typically the  same  as  intuition's
	EasyRequestArgs() only this routine allows you to put in InfoClass style
	command  sequences  in	the  body  text  and  keyboard shortcuts for the
	gadgets.

    INPUTS
	win	- A pointer to the window on which the requester will open. This
		  may be NULL.
	req	- A pointer to	an  initialized  bguiRequest  structure.    This
		  structure is	simular  to  intuition's  EasyStruct  structure.
		  It is used to control the  general  look of the requester. The
		  structure is	initialized  with the following data:

		  br_Flags	  - This  field can contain any of the following
				    flags:

				    BREQF_CENTERWINDOW
					This  will center the requester over the
					window 'win' if a  valid  pointer  to  a
					window is passed.

				    BREQF_LOCKWINDOW
					This will  disable  the window	on which
					the requester appears from receiving any
					IDCMP messages.   Also a busy pointer is
					set on that window.   NOTE: ' win'  must
					point to a window for this to work.

				    BREQF_NO_PATTERN
					This will suppress the backfill pattern.

				    BREQF_XEN_BUTTONS
					When set this flag will make the buttons
					framing appear as XEN style framing.

				    BREQF_AUTO_ASPECT
					When set all  the  requester  will  make
					some aspect  ratio dependant  changes to
					the GUI like thin/thick frames etc.

				    BREQF_FAST_KEYS
					This flag tells BGUI to  use  the Return
					and Esc key as default positive/negative
					responce to the  requester.  Please note
					that  no  visual  confirmation	is given
					at this time when the key is pressed.

		  br_Title	  - A pointer to the title of the requester.  If
				    this is NULL the title of the window is used
				    if one is present.	In the	last  case "BGUI
				    Request"  or  it's  localized  equivalent is
				    used.

		  br_GadgetFormat - A  pointer to the gadget label string.   The
				    gadget  labels   are   truncated  by  a  '|'
				    character. I.E "OK|Cancel" will give  you  a
				    "OK" and a "Cancel" gadget.

				    When you precede the gadget label with a '*'
				    sign the label  of	the  gadget  in question
				    is printed in bold.  Also  this  gadget will
				    automatically be the default responce of the
				    Return key when the BREQF_FAST_KEYS  flag is
				    set (see above).

		  br_TextFormat   - A printf-style formatting  string which  may
				    also   contain   InfoClass	 style	 command
				    sequences.

		  br_ReqPos	  - The  position  at which   the requester will
				    be opened.	 There are three possibilities:

				    POS_CENTERSCREEN
				    POS_CENTERMOUSE
				    POS_TOPLEFT

				    It should be obvious what  they mean.  NOTE:
				    The  BREQF_CENTERWINDOW  flag  will override
				    this setting.

		  br_Underscore   - With this field you  can  set the  character
				    which preceedes the character  to underline.
				    The  underlined  character	will  be the key
				    which activates the gadget.

		  br_Reserved0	  - This  field  is  for  future  expansion  and
				    _must_ be zero.

		  br_Screen	  - Here you can optionally  specify the  Screen
				    on	which  the  requester  must  appear.  By
				    default  the Window it's Screen is used if a
				    valid Window pointer is given.  If no Window
				    is given then this Screen is used.	If  this
				    field is NULL the  default Public  Screen is
				    used.

		  br_Reserved1	  - These fields  are  for  future expansion and
				    _must_ be zero'd.

	args	- A pointer to an array of arguments for the  C-style formatting
		  codes.

    RESULT
	1, 2, 3, 4 ....., 0 You will be returned a value ranging  from	0 to the
	amount of gadgets minus one.	 NOTE: The right most gadget will always
	return 0.
