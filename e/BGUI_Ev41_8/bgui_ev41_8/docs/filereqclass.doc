    NAME
	Class:		filereqclass
	Superclass:	ROOTCLASS
	Include File:	<libraries/bgui.h>

    FUNCTION
	To  provide  a	BOOPSI	interface  class to the ASL FileRequester. The
	advantage  of  this  class is that the objects remember their complete
	settings  like	requester  size,  path,  directory,  file  and pattern
	strings as long as the object remains valid.

    NOTE
	All  the  ASL filerequester attributes as defined in <libraries/asl.h>
	are  usable  with this class. Applicability  for  these ASL attributes
	is (ISGU).

    SEE ALSO

filereqclass/FRM_DOREQUEST

    NAME
	FRM_DOREQUEST -- Popup the filerequester.

    SYNOPSIS
	rc = DoMethod( obj, FRM_DOREQUEST );

	ULONG		rc;

    FUNCTION
	Sending this method to the object will open the requester.

    INPUTS

    RESULT
	rc	- Any of the following return codes:

		FRQ_OK -- Ok. No problems.

		FRQ_CANCEL -- The requester was cancelled by the user.

		FRQ_ERROR_NO_MEM -- Out of memory.

		FRQ_ERROR_NO_FREQ -- It was not possible  for  the  object  to
			allocate a FileRequester structure.

    EXAMPLE
	Object		*freq;
	ULONG		 rc;

	/*
	 *	Open up the file requester.
	 */
	rc = DoMethod( freq, FRM_DOREQUEST );

	switch ( rc ) {
		...
	}

filereqclass/OM_SET

    NAME
	OM_SET -- Set attributes.

    FUNCTION
	Set attributes of the filerequester This method will return 0  if  the
	attributes where set OK. On failure it	will  return  FRQ_ERROR_NO_MEM
	which indicates that the change could not be made.

filereqclass/FRQ_Bounds

	(G).

filereqclass/FRQ_Drawer

    NAME
	FRQ_Drawer -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
	To obtain a pointer to the directory name of the filerequester.

    APPLICABILITY
	(G).

filereqclass/FRQ_File

    NAME
	FRQ_File -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
	To obtain a pointer to the file name of the filerequester.

    APPLICABILITY

filereqclass/FRQ_MultiHook

    NAME
	FRQ_MultiHook -- ( struct Hook * ) ** V40 **

    FUNCTION
	To install a callback hook for multi-select filerequesters.  The  hook
	is called with a pointer to the ASL  FileRequester  structure  as  the
	message packet in register A1.

	You may not cache this pointer. Copy the data you need.

	There is no return code specified for the callback hook.

    DEFAULT
	NULL.

    APPLICABILITY
	(IS).

filereqclass/FRQ_Path

    NAME
	FRQ_Path -- ( STRPTR )

    FUNCTION
	To  obtain  a  pointer	to the full path of the filerequester. This is
	simply the directory with the file name AddPart()'d to it.

    APPLICABILITY
	(G)
