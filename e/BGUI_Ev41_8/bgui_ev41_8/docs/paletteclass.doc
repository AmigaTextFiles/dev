    NAME
	Class:		paletteclass
	Superclass:	baseclass
	Include File:	"PaletteClass.h"

    FUNCTION
	To  provide you with a palette selector gadget simular to the gadtools
	palette gadget. It allows you to select a pen from  a range  of screen
	colors or a range of pens selected by you.

	This class also implements a custom DragNDrop which  allows  the color
	rectangles from the object to be dragged around the screen and dropped
	on objects who are willing to accept data from the dragged object.

	Objects  from  this  class  send  out  the  following  attribute pairs
	in their notification messages:

	GA_ID			- Gadget object ID.
	PALETTE_CurrentColor	- The currently selected pen.

    NOTE
	This  class  is  provided  as source code,  linkable code and a shared
	library version. You should make up your own  mind  which  version you
	prefer to use. The linkable versions are provided for both the SAS and
	DICE  compilers.   The	shared	library  version  can  be  used by all
	programming languages that support libraries but is only compilable by
	SAS/C.

	If  you  decide to use the linkable version your program must open the
	following libraries:

	intuition.library	- V37 or better.
	graphics.library	- V37 or better.
	utility.library         - V37 or better.
	layers.library		- V37 or better.
	bgui.library		- V40 or better.

	Ofcourse these libraries must remain open until you are done using the
	class.

paletteclass/Methods					  paletteclass/Methods

    NEW METHODS
	None.

    CHANGED METHODS
	BASE_GETDRAGOBJECT -- This class overrides the	superclass (baseclass)
		to create a BitMap containing only the color that is selected.

		Please	refer  to  the	baseclass   documentation   for   more
		information on this method. And how to override it.

	BASE_FREEDRAGOBJECT -- This method will free the BitMap created by the
		BASE_GETDRAGOBJECT method.

		Please	refer  to  the	baseclass   documentation   for   more
		information on this method. And how to override it.


paletteclass/Attributes                                paletteclass/Attributes

    NOTE
	All baseclass attributes are also valid for this class.

    NAME
	PALETTE_Depth -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
	To determine the depth of the palette object.	Currently this is  the
	only way to determine the amount of colors in the palette object. This
	will always be a  power  of  2 (I.E. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256).
	Allowable values here are 1 for two colors through 8 for 256 colors.

	Default is 1 (two colors). Applicability is (I).

    NAME
	PALETTE_ColorOffset -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
	To specify the first color which is used in  the palette.  Please note
	that you must specify an ordinal number here, not a pen number.   This
	value  must  range  between  0	and  256  minus  the  amount of colors
	displayed in the palette object.

	Default is 0. Applicability is (I).

    NAME
	PALETTE_PenTable -- ( UWORD * )

    FUNCTION
	To optionally specify an array with pen numbers so that you  can build
	a palette object with the colors you want. Please note that  the array
	must contain at least PALETTE_ColorOffset + ( 1 << PALETTE_Depth ) pen
	entries. This is because the PALETTE_ColorOffset attribute  determines
	at which offset in the array the class will get it's pens.

	Default is NULL. Applicability is (I).

    SEE ALSO
	PALETTE_ColorOffset

    NAME
	PALETTE_CurrentColor -- ( ULONG )

    FUNCTION
	To determine the currently selected pen in the palette object.	Please
	note that this number is a  pen  number,  not  an ordinal color number
	within the palette object itself.

	Default  is  the  first  color in the palette object. Applicability is
	(ISGNU).

    NAME
	BT_DragObject -- ( BOOL )

    FUNCTION
	To enable drag and drop operations with the color  rectangles  in  the
	palette object.

	Default is FALSE. Applicability is (IS).

paletteclass/InitPaletteClass			 paletteclass/InitPaletteClass

    NAME
	InitPaletteClass -- Setup the class.

    SYNOPSIS
	class = InitPaletteClass()

	Class *InitPaletteClass( void )

    FUNCTION
	To allocate a new class structure and setup the class dispatcher.  The
	resulting class pointer may then be used to  create  objects  from the
	class using the intuition NewObjectA() call.

    INPUTS

    RESULT
	A  pointer  to	the  allocated	and  initialized  class  or NULL uppon
	failure.

    BUGS
	None know.

    NOTE
	Only available in the link-library version.

	FreePaletteClass(), intuition.library/NewObjectA()

paletteclass/FreePaletteClass			 paletteclass/FreePaletteClass

    NAME
	FreePaletteClass -- Cleanup the class.

    SYNOPSIS
	success = FreePaletteClass( class )

	BOOL FreePaletteClass( Class * )

    FUNCTION
	To cleanup the class previously created by InitPaletteClass().

    INPUTS
	class	- A pointer to the class as returned by InitPaletteClass().

    RESULT
	TRUE  if  the  cleanup	was  successful or FALSE if not. When FALSE is
	returned there are still objects or subclasses using this class.

    BUGS
	None known.

    NOTE
	Only available in the link-library version.

paletteclass/PALETTE_GetClassPtr	      paletteclass/PALETTE_GetClassPtr

    NAME
	PALETTE_GetClassPtr -- Get a pointer to the class.

    SYNOPSIS
	class = PALETTE_GetClassPtr()
	D0

	Class *PALETTE_GetClassPtr( void )

    FUNCTION
	To obtain a pointer to the class to use for creating objects with  the
	intuition NewObjectA() call.

    INPUTS

    RESULT
	A pointer to the class. This call can not fail.

    BUGS
	None known.

    NOTE
	Only available in the shared library version.
