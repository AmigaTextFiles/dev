        by @{b}Ali Graham@{ub} <agraham@hal9000.net.au>



    @{b}location_plugin@{ub} is a mimimal PLUGIN that
    records the location and size of the window that
    the PLUGIN inhabits, any time it is moved or
    re-sized.

@node LOCATION_USAGE "location_plugin: Usage"

    This is a typical example of the usage of this
    PLUGIN within your source code:


        @{FG shine}DEF location:PTR TO location_plugin

        NEW location

        -> ...

        [PLUGIN, {action_function}, location]

        -> ...

        END location@{FG text}


    NB:

    -   Your action function will be called whenever the window that
        the PLUGIN inhabits is moved or re-sized.

    -   The new values of the window's location and size can be
        accessed from the PLUGIN via

            location.lx     -  window's X location
            location.ly     -  window's Y location
            location.lw     -  window's width
            location.lh     -  window's height

        and these values remain at what they were previously set
        to even when the window is closed (this enables you to
        get the values from the PLUGIN after the closing of the
        GUI but before you END the PLUGIN).
