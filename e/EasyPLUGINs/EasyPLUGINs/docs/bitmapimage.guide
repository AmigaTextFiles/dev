    EasyGUI window. It is a passive plugin that is not resizeable.

    How do I use it?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    To put your image (that does NOT need to be in chip) on an
    EasyGUI-window, just write:

    [PLUGIN, NIL, NEW mybitmap.bitmapimage(imagedata, datasize,
                                           xsize    , ysize,
                                           bitplanes, planeonoff)]

    After a succesfully opened EasyGUI is closed you can free the
    allocated chipdata using the  mybitmap.end()  method.
    If you choose not to the memory will automatically be deallocated
    when the proram terminates. If the GUI is opened several times then
    it is a good idea to use  mybitmap.end()  everytime you close the GUI.


    Exceptions?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~
    This PLUGIN raises "MEM" if it couldn't allocate "datasize" bytes of
    memory in chipmem.

    o   Initial release.

    o   I found a very stupid bug. I had forgot about the planepick
        which resulted in a non-set .nextimage pointer. -> Crash!
