  This is FREEWARE. This little pictures were found in a dank,
  dark corner of my harddrive and I have no idea of where they
  originally came from - hope you don't mind me using them!

  Do you want to easily stick a nice picture into your GUIs? Would
  you like it to remap its palette? Would you like to load it through
  datatypes? Do you mind if it takes ages to load? Would you like
  the option for it to scale? Then dtpic is for you.

@node DTPIC_CONSTRUCTOR "dtpic_plugin: Constructors / Destructor"

   @{BG shine}Constructor@{BG back}

      @{b}init(tags:PTR TO tagitem)@{ub}

      The only currently defined tags are:
      
      @{b}
        PTA_DTPic_Filename
        PTA_DTPic_Scale
        @{ub}

      So for creating a non-scalable picture use:
      
      @{FG shine}
      DEF pic:PTR TO text_plugin
      NEW pic.init([PTA_DTPic_Filename, 'bls', PLA_DTPic_Scale, FALSE, TAG_DONE])
      @{FG text}

  Hello, I'm Will Harwood, doing computer science at Swansea Uni.
  If you want to contact me for any reason then you can e-mail
  my Uni address at:

     @{b} 147800.97@swansea.ac.uk  @{ub}
  
  I usually check this every day, so if you don't receive a reply
  fairly quickly you can bet that the server has fouled up again
  and I didn't get the message, so please sent it again!
  
  If you want to contact me out of term time (24 June-24 September, 
  12 December-12 January, 20 March-20 April) then you can post to:
  	@{b}
     618 Dorchester Road,
     Weymouth,
     Dorset.
     DT3 5LH  @{ub}
  
  ...but obviously e-mail is preferable.
