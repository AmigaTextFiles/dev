DCListview PLUGIN
-----------------

        by Victor Ducedre, <victord@netrover.com>

    This plugin creates a GadTools Listview gadget, almost identical to the
standard EasyGUI one, except that it will also report double-clicks on list
items.

Usage:

    [DCLIST, {actionfunction}, dc, TRUE]

    Notes:
    -   Be sure the 'isgt' field of the PLUGIN gadget is always TRUE, since
    this uses a GadTools gadget.
    -   The DCLIST constant (which =PLUGIN) is available to be used in your
    EasyGUI gadget list, as shown above.  This can make plugins in gadget lists
    easier to identify, especially if you use a lot of different plugins.
    -   Your action function will be called (or your action value returned by
    easyguiA()) when:
        -   an item is selected with the mouse, and again on a double click.
        -   the assigned key is pressed, alone or shifted.
        NOTE: if you use an action value instead of an action function, you
        won't hear about double clicks since your GUI will have closed :-)

Methods:

    dclistview(tags)

          The constructor for this plugin, where 'tags' is a PTR TO a list of
        tagitems from those listed below marked [I].  All values default to
        something reasonable, so you can use simply [TAG_DONE] as your list.
          You *must* open 'utility.library' prior to calling this function, or
        it will raise a "util" exception.
          This function has no return value.

    set(attr, val)

          Sets any attribute to the value given, where 'attr' is any item
        listed below that is marked [S], and 'val' is some reasonable value
        for said attribute.
          This function has no return value, EXCEPT when setting DCLV_CURRENT
        to a new value.  In this case it returns the value that DCLV_CURRENT
        was actually set to, should you have tried to set it to a value that
        was out of range (saving you having to check this *every* time).

    value, check:=get(attr)

          Gets the value for the specified attribute, where 'attr' is any item
        listed below marked [G].  The second returned value, 'check', is TRUE
        if 'attr' is in fact "getable", otherwise FALSE.

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Possible attribute tags:

    DCLV_LABEL                        [I..]
        The label which appears above the gadget.  Including a "_" in
        this string will automatically assign the next character as the
        keyboard shortcut, and will indicate it as such in the label.
        (Default: No label text)
    DCLV_RELX                         [I..]
        The usual relative gadget width (Default: 5)
    DCLV_RELY                         [I..]
        The usual relative gadget height (Default: 5)
    DCLV_LIST                         [ISG]
        The list to be displayed in the gadget.  Usual gadtools handling
        applies:  set to NIL to remove the list from the gadget, set to -1
        to detach the list without clearing it. (Default: NIL)
    DCLV_CURRENT                      [ISG]
        The list item to be highlighted and placed at the top of the listview.
        This item will be displayed beneath the listview under v37 or with a
        highlight bar under v39.  This value will always be updated when the
        user selects a list item.
    **  NOTE: If you don't want ANY list item highlighted initally, set this
        tag to -1 (Default).  NOTE FURTHER, though, that the value of this
        attribute will NOT change if the user does not manipulate the listview
        in any way.  If you set DCLV_CURRENT to -1 at any point, be prepared
        to properly handle -1 as a returned value when you get(DCLV_CURRENT).
    DCLV_DISABLED                     [ISG]
        Whether this gadget is disabled.  Works under v39+ only, and is
        minimal at best (the listview is disabled, but the attached prop
        gadget will still scroll the list.  This is a problem with Gadtools,
        not this module).  (Default: FALSE)
    DCLV_TOP                          [ISG]
        Sets which item in the list is to be diplayed at the top of the
        listview, without changing the item currently selected.
    DCLV_CLICK                        [..G]
        This will be set to TRUE when an item from the listview has been
        double-clicked.

Exceptions:

    "dclv" will be raised by gtrender() if the gadget can't be created.
    "util" will be raised by dclistview() if utility.library isn't open.

History:

13-Jul-97  First release

19-Aug-97  Second release
           - removed a v39-only function that pretty much squashed the plugin
             under v37.

19-Jan-98  Third release
           - rewritten in a style similar to the EasyPLUGINs Style Guide;
           - replaced long list of constructor arguments with a taglist;
           - replaced specific set#?/get#? functions with multi-purpose ones,
             allowing many more attributes to be set/get with minimum effort,
             and allowing the entire dclistview object to be made private;
           - now checks if window and gadget exist (i.e., not iconified) before
             updating attributes;
           - simplified the node-counter function;

7-Mar-98   Fourth release
           - fixed a bug that rendered keypresses useless when "_" was the
             first character of the label string;
           - removed 'vers' from the object and replaced with direct calls to
             KickVersion(), saving a total of eight bytes :-)
