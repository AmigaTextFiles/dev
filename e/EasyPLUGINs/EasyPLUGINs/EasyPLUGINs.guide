@node INTRODUCTION "Introduction"

    EasyPLUGINs is a collection of PLUGINs for EasyGUI, the GUI
    module for AmigaE users by Wouter van Oortmerssen and Jason
    R. Hulance.

    These PLUGINs are by a number of different authors; most of
    them include documentation. Some also come with example
    sources and/or the source code for the modules themselves.

    EasyPLUGINs should be considered as freeware, but users may NOT
    redistribute a changed version of any of the PLUGINs included
    in the package. Instead, they should contact the original
    @{"authors" link AUTHORS} and have those additions, bugfixes etc. happen at the
    source (no pun intended :)

    If people release software based on one or more PLUGINs, they
    should credit the author of those PLUGINs in their documentation
    and/or software; if it's shareware/commercial, a registered copy
    to the author(s) wouldn't go astray either (not a requirement,
    but it would be polite...)

    (This should be taken as a general policy for all PLUGINs
    for which the documentation does not specify any differently.
    Check the documentation for any individual PLUGIN you are
    interested in to see if the legal status of that PLUGIN is
    different from the default status outlined above.)

@node STYLE "Style Guide"


    @{b}@{FG shine}EasyPLUGINs@{FG text}@{ub} Style Guide

        by Ralph Wermke and Ali Graham.



    @{b}This is a document describing a useful, elegant and easily
    extensible standard style for PLUGINs. While its acceptance
    is by no means compulsory, the use of this framework as a
    template for the development of your PLUGINs can speed up
    your work and improve the functionality of the PLUGINs you
    produce.@{ub}

    Even if you do not want to program your own PLUGINs, but
    only want to use the ones provided, you should probably
    read this Style Guide anyway, especially the section
    on @{"tags" link STYLE_3}; it will give you a better understanding of the
    PLUGINs that use this standard and the manner in which
    they work.

    This, then, is the general procedure that you should
    follow in the development of any PLUGIN:


    @{"  " link STYLE_1}  decide the features that your PLUGIN should have

    @{"  " link STYLE_2}  construct the object

    @{"  " link STYLE_3}  list the tags to be used by the PLUGIN

    @{"  " link STYLE_4}  build the public interface to the PLUGIN
        (constructor, destructor, set() & get() methods)

    @{"  " link STYLE_5}  actually implement the desired functionality

    @{"  " link STYLE_6}  test, debug, extend, enhance, and document

@endnode

@node STYLE_1 "Style Guide (1)"


    1.  @{b}Design@{ub}


        Always the most important part of programming; you
        may have some pre-existing code that you want to adapt,
        or merely a few ideas about what you want to write.
        Take out a pen and a piece of paper, sit down and plan
        it all - it saves a lot of time in the long run. :)

        This is one of the more valuable things I've learnt
        in my studies of Computer Science at university; that
        you should attempt to minimize the time actually spent
        coding. Thinking, testing and debugging should be more
        important parts of the process.

@endnode

@node STYLE_2 "Style Guide (2)"


    2.  @{b}Construction@{ub}

        Adopt an easy to remember, reasonably brief name that
        is representative of the functionality of the PLUGIN.
        Then add '_plugin' to that, like so:

            @{FG shine}OBJECT <xyz>_plugin PRIVATE
               a
               b
               c
            ENDOBJECT@{FG text}

        The various values defined inside the object; these
        should all be defined as PRIVATE unless you have a
        very good reason, as this encourages encapsulation/
        data-hiding/good OO practice in general. Instead, use
        the @{"set() & get()" LINK STYLE_4 55} methods to access these values in
        a more strictly defined manner.

        I also suggest separating the values inside the
        PLUGIN object into two sections; initially, place
        all of the variables that will be accessible by
        set() or get() (or both) at the top of the object,
        and then under those place the truly private
        variables.

        No global variables should be defined in PLUGIN
        modules, except library bases - which only enter
        as a side effect of the inclusion of library
        modules anyway. Global variables are bad, and
        will may well prevent people using more than one
        instance of your PLUGIN.

        Another suggestion is to define a CONST, equal to
        the value of PLUGIN, with an uppercase version of
        your PLUGIN's name (with @{FG shine}EP_@{FG text} prepended to avoid
        any compilation clashes and the like.

        e.g. sample_plugin would have

            @{FG shine}CONST EP_SAMPLE=PLUGIN@{FG text}

        and could then be added to an EasyGUI with the
        line

            @{FG shine}[EP_SAMPLE, {sample_action}, sample]@{FG text}


@endnode

@node STYLE_3 "Style Guide (3)"


    3.  @{b}Tags@{ub}


        This style guide defines a special form for the
        tags to be used by the PLUGINs. (Advantages of the
        use of tags, while somewhat outside the scope of this
        document, include clarity of code and the enforcement
        of certain consistencies of interface.)

        The prefix PLA_ (@{b}PL@{ub}ugin @{b}A@{ub}ttribute) is used for tags
        which modify attributes of the object and PLV_
        (@{b}PL@{ub}ugin @{b}V@{ub}alue) for special values for attributes. The
        prefix is now followed by the object name and then by
        a special name for the tag e.g. attribute name.

            @{FG shine}PLA_Xyz_<AttrName>@{FG text}

        The first letter of every word is uppercase, in the
        same way as the standard library calls.

        e.g.

            @{FG shine}PLA_Text_Color@{FG text}
            @{FG shine}PLA_Bar_Hidden@{FG text}
            @{FG shine}PLA_BigGadget_Contents@{FG text}

        The tag base to be used for these tags should be
        calculated in the following way:

            @{FG shine}TAG_USER@{FG text} OR Shl(@{FG shine}PROGRAMMER_ID@{FG text}, 24) OR
            Shl(@{FG shine}PLUGIN_ID@{FG text}, 16) OR (<Number of tag>)

        where

    @{FG shine}TAG_USER@{FG text}      is as defined in <utility/tagitem.h>, $80000000.

    @{FG shine}PROGRAMMER_ID@{FG text} is your assigned ID - you will be given one on
                  application to the coordinator of EasyPLUGINs. If
                  you don't have an ID assigned yet, use the code
                  for a private module, $7F.

    @{FG shine}PLUGIN_ID@{FG text}     is a number decided by you, between $00 and $FF.
                  Make sure this number does not conflict with any
                  of your other publically released modules.

    @{FG shine}Number of Tag@{FG text} (just iterate from 0 or 1 using ENUM, not
                  forgetting to EXPORT these ENUM'd tags as
                  they serve as the external interface to your
                  PLUGIN.)


    For example, say that I have decided to code a PLUGIN
    that draws a scaleable file-gadget image. I would
    start by calculating the tag-base - assume that I am the
    53rd registered EasyPLUGINs module programmer (I wish :)
    and that my PROGRAMMER_ID was therefore $34 (counting in
    hex and from 0 like all good programmers...) and that this
    is the 5th PLUGIN that I am writing.

    The tag base for this PLUGIN would then be:     @{FG shine}$B4050000@{FG text}

    The tag base is best understood when segmented, like this:

        @{b}$ [B4] [05] [0000]@{ub}
           ^^   ^^   ^^^^
           |    |    |
           |    |    |___ (wil be incremented for each tag)
           |    |
           |    |___ ($050000, for the fifth PLUGIN)
           |
           |___ ($80000000 OR $34000000)


@endnode

@node STYLE_4 "Style Guide (4)"


    4.  @{b}Public interface@{ub}


    Now to move on to the standard methods. Each PLUGIN
    should have three or four standard methods: a constructor
    (and often a destructor), and methods to @{FG shine}set()@{FG text} and @{FG shine}get()@{FG text}
    certain values in order to control the PLUGIN's behaviour.

    The constructor should have the same name as the PLUGIN
    object, for similarity to C++ semantics; i.e. a PLUGIN
    called @{b}vector_plugin@{ub} would have a constructor method
    named @{FG shine}vector()@{FG text}. This method should only take one argument,
    a tag list.

    Thus, the constructor for this hypothetical vector_plugin
    would be defined like this:

        @{FG shine}PROC vector(tags:PTR TO tagitem) OF vector_plugin

            ....

        ENDPROC@{FG text}

    Inside the constructor, the initial action should be the reading
    of the tags provided in the tag list by the user of the PLUGIN:

        @{FG shine}PROC vector(tags:PTR TO tagitem) OF vector_plugin

            IF utilitybase

                self.colour  :=  GetTagData(PLA_Vector_Colour, 1, tags)
                self.disabled  := GetTagData(PLA_Vector_Disabled, FALSE, tags)

            ELSE

                Raise("util")

            ENDIF

            -> any other necessary resource allocation

        ENDPROC@{FG text}

    You may want to open and close the @{FG text}utility.library@{FG text} inside
    the constructor; this is really a matter of personal choice.
    However, it is easiest to only open this once per project;
    to have, for example, five PLUGINs all opening the library
    is a waste of executable size.
    (Remember, @{FG shine}utilitybase@{FG text} is defined in the 'utility.m' module,
    so you'll need to include that in the MODULE definitions at
    the start of your PLUGIN module.)


    The PLUGIN should also have @{FG shine}set()@{FG text} & @{FG shine}get()@{FG text} methods in order to
    change and read the values inside the PLUGIN. In order to avoid
    a myriad number of @{FG shine}setxxx()@{FG text} and @{FG shine}getyyy()@{FG text} PROCs, like in the
    original EasyGUI :), these should be generalized to one method
    each:

    e.g.

        @{FG shine}PROC set(attr, value) OF vector_plugin

            SELECT attr

                CASE PLA_Vector_Colour

                    self.colour:=value

                    -> call the draw() method to redraw

                CASE PLA_Vector_Disabled

                    self.disabled:=value

                    -> call the draw() method to redraw

            ENDSELECT

        ENDPROC@{FG text}


    and the @{FG shine}get()@{FG text} method works in a similar way:

    e.g.

        @{FG shine}PROC get(attr) OF xyz

            SELECT attr

                CASE PLA_Xyz_Colour;     RETURN self.colour, TRUE
                CASE PLA_Xyz_Disabled;   RETURN self.disabled, TRUE

            ENDSELECT

        ENDPROC -1, FALSE@{FG text}

    The @{FG shine}get()@{FG text} method has 2 return values. The first one is
    the requested value and the second one indicates whether
    the attribute is gettable or not. This may not really be
    necessary, but it is probably a handy convention to
    introduce now in case sub-classing of PLUGINs becomes
    endemic...


    The destructor, as is always the case in E's OOP
    structures, must be called @{FG shine}end()@{FG text} and take no arguments.
    In this you can free any structures or resources allocated
    in the constructor.

        @{FG shine}PROC end() OF vector_plugin

            ....

        ENDPROC@{FG text}

@endnode

@node STYLE_5 "Style Guide (5)"


    5.  @{b}Implementation@{ub}


    This basically involves the @{FG shine}render()@{FG text} methods, the message
    testing methods and any private methods you may want the
    PLUGIN to use. As these methods are not a part of the public
    interface of your PLUGIN, as the methods discussed in the
    @{"last section" link STYLE_4} were, this section can therefore be taken as
    an advisory one; you can diverge from the standards shown
    here (except, of course, the ones set by the EasyGUI docs
    themselves) while still earning the EasyPLUGIN's Style
    Guide @{FG fill}Seal of Quality®@{FG text}.

    If your PLUGIN does a lot of drawing, or has a number of
    various paths it can take in the course of its rendering,
    you may want to split up the @{FG shine}render()@{FG text} or @{FG shine}gtrender()@{FG text} method;
    your method would then look like this:

        @{FG shine}PROC @{FG text}[gt]@{FG shine}render(...) OF sample_plugin

           DEF oldwin

           self.ta :=ta         /* save ta for use in other methods (if needed)*/

           /* this part is necessary  because this function behaves not like the
              other ones and the self.gh.wnd is not correctly set */
           oldwin:=self.gh.wnd  /* at this time wnd is 0 but it may change in a newer version*/
           self.gh.wnd:=win
           self.draw(TRUE)      /* full redraw */
           self.gh.wnd:=oldwin

        ENDPROC@{FG text}

    and the @{FG shine}draw()@{FG text} method would look like this:

        @{FG shine}PROC draw(redraw=FALSE) OF sample_plugin

            IF self.gh=0 THEN RETURN  /* don't draw when gui isn't initialized */
            IF self.gh.wnd=0 THEN RETURN  /* ignore draw when window is closed */

            -> ...
            -> here you can do your drawing stuff
            -> and it's possible to select between update and full redraw -
            -> if your PLUGIN can be disabled, you may want to use the
            -> functions from the module 'tools/ghost'
            -> ...

        ENDPROC@{FG text}

    The advantage of this is that the @{FG shine}draw()@{FG text} method can then be
    easily called from, for example, the @{FG shine}set()@{FG text} method of your
    PLUGIN.

    If you don't need this then just use the @{FG shine}render()@{FG text} or
    @{FG shine}gtrender()@{FG text} method in the normal fashion.

    As to the message handling methods, @{FG shine}message_test()@{FG text} and
    @{FG shine}message_action()@{FG text}, there are no special rules in this
    Style Guide concerning them; just obey the suggestions
    made in EasyGUI.doc, and make sure that the @{FG shine}message_test()@{FG text}
    method executes very quickly.

    Many PLUGINs will offer the AppWindow method, and this
    is a good basic form for it to take:

    @{FG shine}PROC appmessage(amsg:PTR TO appmessage, win:PTR TO window) OF sample_plugin

        DEF xok=FALSE, yok=FALSE

        xok:=(amsg.mousex>=(self.x)) AND (amsg.mousex<=(self.x+self.xs-1))
        yok:=(amsg.mousey>=(self.y)) AND (amsg.mousey<=(self.y+self.ys-1))

    ENDPROC ((xok AND yok) AND (self.disabled=FALSE))@{FG text}

    (Of course, if your PLUGIN does not implement being
    disabled/enabled then just leave that part out of the
    final return-value).

@node STYLE_6 "Style Guide (6)"


    6.  @{b}Testing, debugging and documentation@{ub}


    A minor but necessary part of the process; adapt an
    example program to use your new PLUGIN and make sure
    it all works as advertised.

    If not, get the bugs out and try again; repeat
    @{i}ad nauseam @{ui}until the PLUGIN is working well.

    Then it's time to sit down and actually document the
    PLUGIN; because of the strictly followed structure of
    this Style Guide, this should not be too difficult,
    as you should have a good idea of what you have done
    and the manner in which your PLUGIN operates.

    Also, consider some brief documentation in the sources
    and examples themselves, as well as commenting the
    sources well. Always include your name and e-mail address
    somewhere in the sources, as it makes it much easier
    for someone to contact you if that particular
    PLUGIN source has become separated from the package
    as a whole.

    I suggest that you use the following template as a
    way of describing your PLUGINs, and use it in each
    one you write:

        @{FG shine}$VER:@{FG text} @{b}<plugin_name> <plugin_version> (<plugin_date>)@{ub}

        @{FG shine}Author:@{FG text}     @{b}<your name> (<your EPSG programmer id>)
                    <your e-mail address>@{ub}

        @{FG shine}PLUGIN id:@{FG text}  @{b}<EPSG plugin id>@{ub}

        @{FG shine}Desc.:@{FG text}      @{b}<brief description of the PLUGIN>@{ub}

    The following two sections are optional:

        @{FG shine}Tags:@{FG text}       @{b}<list of supported PLA_... tags, including [ISG] status>@{ub}

        @{FG shine}Values:@{FG text}     @{b}<list of supported PLV_... values>@{ub}

        @{FG shine}History:@{FG text}    @{b}<sequential list of the changes to the PLUGIN>@{ub}

    Examples for your plugins should contain, as a minimum,
    the @{FG shine}$VER:@{FG text}, @{FG shine}Author@{FG text} and @{FG shine}Desc.@{FG text} fields.

This section has been included in the documentation as
a public noticeboard; here authors of PLUGINs can announce
their current projects, and ask for feedback or suggestions
from other authors and from the general public.

The PLUGINs which are currently being worked on are:

+- imagebutton plugin ------------------------------------+
|                                                         |
| Replacing the functionality of the external             |
| button.gadget file, using only those BOOPSI classes     |
| internal to the Amiga OS.                               |

|                                                         |
| It's just an idea and I only started to program the     |
| basics of this class. I planned to create a  multi      |
| column lv with horizontal scrolling and PC like titles. |
| It should provide sorting and resizing of columns.      |
| But as I said I just started this plugin and I need a   |
| lot of suggestions.                                     |

|                                                         |
| Once the imagebutton_plugin is complete, I'll use that  |
| knowledge to create a gadget that can display both      |
| images and text.                                        |

|                                                         |
| It supports pop-up menus simular in purpose to cycle    |
| gadgets except that the full list pops up.              |
| A beta version will be available soon.                  |

      register_plugin:      @{b}Ralph Wermke@{ub}       <wermke@gryps1.rz.uni-greifswald.de>

    @{b}v1.2@{ub}                                   (28.10.97)

    o   Forgot to make some minor changes to some of the examples which
        they would not compile without. Now fixed.

    o   Added one new PLUGIN:

      rawkey_plugin:        @{b}Fabio Rotondo@{ub}      <fsoft@intercom.it>

    o   Changes made to five PLUGINs:

    @{b}v1.3@{ub}                                   (28.11.97)

    o   Added @{"Style Guide" link STYLE}, @{"Works in Progress" link FUTURE}, @{"Tag Bases" link TAGBASES} and
        @{"Requests" link REQUESTS} sections to the documentation.

    o   Added German installation strings, which will automatically be used if
        the system is localized to use the language (for some reason, forcing it
        through the tooltype @{b}LANGUAGE=deutsch@{ub} doesn't work at the moment,
        despite what the docs for the Installer say.).

      @{FG shine}Thanks to Ralph Wermke for his invaluable work on the above two items!@{FG text}

    o   Added three new PLUGINs:

      popasl_plugin:        @{b}Ralph Wermke@{ub}       <wermke@gryps1.rz.uni-greifswald.de>
      icongad_plugin:       @{b}Fabio Rotondo@{ub}      <fsoft@intercom.it>
      toolbar_plugin:       @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>

      basicgauge_plugin:    @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>
        (too similar to simplegauge_plugin)
      imagebutton_plugin:   @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>
        (too similar to an example in the EasyGUI package)
      title_plugin:         @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>
        (functionality subsumed into text_plugin)

    o   Changes made to five PLUGINs:

    @{b}v1.4@{ub}                                   (30.1.98)

    o   Sorry about the delay - life gets in the way sometimes, especially
        around Christmas :(

    o   Added another @{"registered" link TAGBASES} programmer.

    o   Split the install scripts up by language.

    o   Added @{FG shine}=NIL@{FG text} as a default argument for the constructors.

    o   Added a beta version of @{b}epSG@{ub}, the @{FG shine}EasyPLUGINs StyleGuide
        SkeletonGenerator@{FG text} (maybe @{b}ep(SG)²@{ub} would be a better name :)
        Thanks to @{b}Ralph Wermke@{ub} for writing this! Send him feedback if you
        want to see changes or improvements made to this program...

    o   Added one new PLUGIN:

      space_plugin:         @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>

    o   Changes made to three PLUGINs:

    @{b}v1.5@{ub}                                   (18.2.98)

    o   Added a few things to the Style Guide - suggestions on including an
        @{FG shine}EP_@{FG text}... CONST and on the appmessage() method, and a brief mention
        of the importance of comments and documentation.

    o   Corrected some documentation bugs (even here in the history! :)

    o   Added five new PLUGINs:

      corners_plugin:       @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>
      dtpic_plugin:         @{b}Will Harwood@{ub}       <147800.97@swansea.ac.uk>

    @{b}v1.6@{ub}                                   (25.2.98)

    o   Added a template for intra-source description of PLUGINs in the
        @{"last section" link STYLE_6} of the Style Guide.

    o   Added a '.build' script for EBuild in the examples directory; since
        the compiled demos add up to over 500K, I felt this was a healthier
        alternative than including them.

    o   Oops! Left out dclistview_demo.e. It's there now :).

    o   Changes made to three PLUGINs:

      corners_plugin:       @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>
      multitext_plugin:     @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>

    @{b}v1.7@{ub}                                   (25.3.98)

    o   Split up the @{"history" link HISTORY_CONTENTS} in the documentation, as I'm sure
        you'll have noticed by now :)

    o   Changed the .build script into one that will compile all
        examples, all sources or both -- have a look at it to see
        what I mean. (It now resides in the main directory.)

    o   Changed the information about subscribing to the AmigaE
        mailing list in the @{"authors" link AUTHORS} section.

    o   Changes made to four PLUGINs:

      dclistview_plugin:    @{b}Victor Ducedre@{ub}     <victord@netrover.com>
      multitext_plugin:     @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>

    o   (No April release because very little had changed and no
         contributions had been received.... if you want to see more
         of EasyPLUGINs, contribute something!)

    o   Improved the multitext_demo.e example source to show the use of
        disk-based fonts.

    o   Added one new PLUGIN:

      bar_plugin:           @{b}Ali Graham@{ub}         <agraham@hal9000.net.au>

    o   Changes made to two PLUGINs:

@node SUBMISSIONS "Submissions"


    This is the general procedure for submissions:

    - You send me the plugin that you would like in the
      package; source code, compiled module and a small
      amount of documentation on how to use the methods
      of the PLUGIN (which I'll weave into this
      documentation in the appropriate place).

    - You retain copyright over the PLUGIN; you are listed
      in the documentation as the author of the software,
      and people are encouraged to contact you with changes
      to be included in the next release.

    - Source code is provided to the modules for two reasons;
      future-proof-ness (i.e. if the general EasyGUI PLUGIN
      definitions change somewhat, people can change the source
      and recompile), and the fact that people may want to
      change the way the PLUGINs operate before using them.
      I prefer to include source code for the modules, but I
      do not insist on it -- however, you should be willing
      to pass the source on to someone else if you have no
      further desire to support or improve the PLUGIN.

    If anybody wants to release a module in this package under
    conditions differing from those above, contact me and I'll
    see if we can come to some arrangement.
