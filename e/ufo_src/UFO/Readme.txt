Introduction
------------
  This is a game I've started, but I ran into trouble, and lost my
  inspiration. Therefor I've decided to release it, so others could
  have a look at my work, and maybe learn somthing of it.
  Sure, my code is pretty lousy, but I'm sure some of you could use
  some of it.
