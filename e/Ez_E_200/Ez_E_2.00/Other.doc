Short and Sweet:

    ExeGui:  Just a simple replacement for Execute. Lets you use a file
             requester to select a file.
             Usage: ExeGui DIR/F

    Include: Simple Pre-Processor to use include type files with E.
             Usage: Include FILE/F     (note: either use with .e or not)

        How it works: It scans your source code for the keyword INCLUDE.
                      followed by a target to include:

                      EX: INCLUDE "Emodules:Includes/Detach.e"

                      It will produce a final output file with a suffix of
                      "_inc.e", that is identical to your source, except that
                      it has been merged with all included files.

         !! NOTE !! : Include is recursive, so if you accidenly make a loop
                      of includes, it WILL get stuck, and you WILL have to
                      reboot to reset (no CtrlC() checking.)

                 Ex:  (-> means includes)
                      a -> b,d,e
                      b -> c,f,g,h
                      c -> m,p,b    <- closed loop here!!!

                      Then, just compile your program with EC.

                      To re-compile ExeGui, try this:
                        CD to the dir containing Exegui.e, then

                      Type In                     Produces

                      INCLUDE ExeGui              ExeGui_inc.e
                      EC ExeGue_inc               ExeGue_inc
                      RENAME ExeGui_inc ExeGui    ExeGui

        LIMITS:       Include DOES NOT scan your included files for
                      duplicate DEF, MODULE, PROC, etc... statements.
                      Make sure that each module contains only
                      UNIQUE PROC NAMES AND GLOBAL VARIABLES
                      Globall definitions are handled properly by Include,
                      but again, are not checked for duplicates.
