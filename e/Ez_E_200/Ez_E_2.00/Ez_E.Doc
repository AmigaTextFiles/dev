Ez_E V2.00 by Kevin Connell

  This is a simple GUI interface to use with E.  I wrote it to make programming
in E a simpler task.  I disliked shuffling windows around, opening a shell
'CD'-ing to the right directory, and doing all that typing.

Ez_E makes E Ez!!!

  It's really just a simple cover that replaces all that window shuffling and
typing. There are 8 simple buttons that should be self explanatory, but the use
of each is as follows:

Editor:  This will open your editor.  It will present you a file requestor, and
         all you need to do is locate your current work file.  It will
         automatically pass the name of this file to your editor, so don't worry
         about passing command strings.

Project: This allows you to save each individual project you are working on.
         Information saved includes: Path and name of current source file,
         current Compiler options, current execute options, and whether you
         are using a precompiler or not.
        ** Note: When you open a new project with this button, Ez_E will
           automatically open the source in your editor, set the proper state on
           PCP, and fill in the strings for compiling and execution.

PCP:     This button will toggle useage of ANY file Pre-Compiler. Note that if
         you are using EPP, you must have it properly installed (see the docs
         on how to use EPP). It cycles between the on and off stage, and the
         current setting is saved in the PROJECT.


Compile: This button will compile your program.  All output from the compiler
         will appear in the 'Ez_E IO window' so you can see what it is doing.
        ** Note: that you should have selected a work file with editor before
           using this button, but if you didn't, it will ask you for an .e file
           to use as the object.
        ** Note: If you are using a pre-compiler, Compile will automatically call
           your pre-compiler before it calls EC.
        ** Note: New in 2.00; you can now add a command line string in the gadget
           to the right of this button. THIS COMMAND LINE IS ONLY PASSED TO EC,
           AND NOT TO ANY PRECOMPILER!!!
           The current command line string is saved when you save your project.

Execute: This will (attempt to) run the program you are currently working on with
         optional command line arguments.
         If you have not opened a project with the editor or the compiler button,
         it will do nothing at all.  Currently opens a full screen window to run
         your program in.
        ** Note: New in 2.00; you can now add a command line string in the gadget
           to the right of this button. The current command line string is saved
           when you save your project.

Config:  Not yet implemented. You need to do this:

         If upgrading from an early Ez_E, delete the file "S:Ez_E.cfg"
         Start Ez_E
         Exit Ez_E
         Use a text editor to open the file "S:Ez_E.Cfg"
         Change the arguments to what you require
         Save the file
         Restart Ez_E, and press Config. You will get a dump of the internal
           settings. If they do not match what you typed in, delete S:Ez_E.cfg
           and start over.

    Defaults: Path to EC     = 'C:'       This is where Ez_E will look for EC to
                                          compile the programs.
              Path to Editor = 'C:'       This is where Ez_E will look for your
                                          editor.
              Name of Editor = 'MeMacs'   This is the name of the default editor.
              Work Directory = 'RAM:'     This is where Ez_E will look for your
                                          .e source.
              Project Path   = 'RAM:'     This is where your project files are
              Path to PCP    = 'C:'       This is where Ez_E will look for your
                                          pre-compiler.
              Name of PCP    = 'Include'  Options: EPP, Include
                                          !!! NOTE: A PCP is NOT required to be
                                              used with Ez_E!!!
              Using a PCP?   = 'Y'        Options: Y / N

About:   Just a little requester with some info about me in it.

Exit:    Use this to exit Ez_E. (What did you expect?)

And thats it!  Short, simple, and Ez to use.

History:

  V1.0   Written on May 10, 1993.  Really just as a test of some stuff in 'E'.
         Updated May 31, Same revision, made it a bit more friendly.

  V1.1   Updated May 31, made 2.0 specific. Released to file echo.

  V1.2   Updated June 27, Added support for EPP preprocessor.
         Changed the config stuff around a bit, hopefully better.
         Not Released to file echos.

  V1.3   Updated July 26, Changed support from EPP to any preprocessor.
         Added New Button, "CLI Exec", so you could launch programs with
         arguments (like from CLI).
         Released to file echo.

         Fixed Bug in "CLI Exec" button. Was adding an extra ^@ to the end of
         the command line.
         Included a simple pre-processor called "Include", and a replacement
         for "Execute" that features a file requester (w/source).

  V2.00  Beta Version - Updated August 25
         Complete re-write from the ground up. Broke the code into modules,
         and used Include to reconstruct it.
         Added commandline options for EC, and for executing. Made output
         window resizeable, for ease of use. Window is now "Font Smart", and
         adjusts up to about a 14 point font with no problems.
         Implemented "Projects", a sub configuration.

To Do:

         GET THE CONFIG BUTTON WORKING!!! (Actually, it had been a while, and
         Ez_E had improved so much, I wanted to get a new version out there).

         Thought: How often do you change your main config? Maybe I should
         just write a small config program, and leave this space open for a
         new function????

         Add an Arexx port, so any rexx capable editor can activate Ez_E.
