    Head:
    =====
  This software has been written in AmigaE3.2e!!!

    Introduction:
    =============
  If you like this software, so you can sent me a nail...
  Do not forget: You use these programs only on your own...
  If you have two similar (long) files, so it takes you store on your
  harddisk.
  With program "Sub" you can create subtraction of the files and it
  can be compressed with much higher ratio (if the files are similar!!!).

  Program Sub Subtracts two files and the result writes to ".sub" file.
  Program Add Adds two files and the result writes to "2" file.

  You can use this programs for coding your files and decoding it with mask.


    Usage:
    ======
  Sub <file>   where the <file> is name of files: <file>1 and <file>2

               e.g.: Sub RAM:Hello - this tries to open file "RAM:Hello1"
                                     and file "RAM:Hello2" then creates
                                     file "RAM:Hello.sub"

  Add <file>   where the <file> is name of files: <file>1 and <file>.sub

               e.g.: Add RAM:Hello - this tries to open file "RAM:Hello1"
                                     and file "RAM:Hello.sub" then creates
                                     file "RAM:Hello2"

    Requirements:
    =============
  An Amiga...
  I didn't test it on OS1.3 or earlier, but I think it can run.

  It was programmed in AmigaE3.0aDemo on
  A1200+Blizzard1228+4MBFastRAM+HD+OS3.0


    Future:
    =======
  Graphical User Interface(GUI)
