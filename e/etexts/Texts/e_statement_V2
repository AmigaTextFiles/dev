                      The future of Amiga E

                    by Wouter van Oortmerssen

The question I get most from programmers is: when will the new version
of E be out, what it will cost and what are it's features? since the
answer is of interest to just about anybody working with E, I'll let
everybody in on some scoops:

I've been working for quite some time now on a new E v2.3, and the
reason I haven't released any 2.2 or 2.3 versions but instead continue
to work on 2.5 is that many new features require other new features,
and thus I'll have to make v2.5 a MAJOR update. Parts of the compiler
have been rewritten and datastructures reorganised for efficiency,
and are not stable enough for release yet. When the new version comes
out, it will be yet another milestone, and again a stable one!

The current version betatesters work with is v2.3i/v2.4e, and it already
has the following features:

- error reconstruction: EC now exactly pinpoints the character that
  caused the error
- optimisations: EC is now 20% to 70% faster than EC2.1b
- optimisations in code-generation.
- reduction in EC's memory consumption with 40% to 50%
- default arguments a la C++
- kick 3.0 modules
- object inheritance (without methods, for now)
- multiple returnvalues and multiple-value assignments
- symbolhunks for use with profiler
- .o to .m file converter (for assembly)
- numerous small bugs fixed and small enhancements made

and most important:

- compilation to modules.
  this allows you to write sources with OBJECTs, PROCs and CONSTs in
  them, and have them compiled to a ".m" file for use in other programs.

From v2.4 on, I added OPTIMISATIONS:
- v2.1b did not put variables in registers, thus code that depends
  largely on the time needed to access a variabele would be slower.
  v2.4 allows to put upto 5 variables per PROC in registers,
  thus giving an enormous speedup in tight loops.
- v2.1b did only little checks to see if it could optimize instructions
  away. v2.4 now tries various ways to write the code different,
  reorganise it, or remove it alltogether. also it optimizes on
  function calls etc., by directly moving certain types of
  expressions in registers. This both reduces code size, and increases
  speed of executables. with the new OPT 020, it can do even more.

other new features in v2.4 include:
- module caching: this feature allows EC to keep modules
  in memory between compilations. effectively this means that
  the first time you compile a source which needs 10 modules
  EC will load them all from disk, the second upto the n-th
  time it doesn't have to load any.
- the NEW operator allows for quick and easy dynamic
  memory allocation, with automatic exception raising.
- increasing number of great modules for all sorts of
  tasks. the plan is that E will provide an enormous
  amount of these modules to allow quick programming
  of large, quality apps. v2.5 will already have
  modules for:
  * both simple 3d vectors and fully fledged realtime
    double-buffered 3d filled vectors
  * protracker player
  * iff loader/saver etc.
  * hashing
  * easy file access
  * lexical analysing
  * garbage collected LISP-lists
  * all sorts of Amiga.lib and amiga support routines
  and much more.

Features that probably will also be implemented before the next release:
- full float (:REAL), 68881/2 support.
- a better version of SrcGen supporting the v2.5 features
- more code generation optimisations
- some 020 support
- vast amount of highlevel modules for all sorts of tasks.

Features that I don't know of in which release they'll be implemented:
- other OO features (next to object inheritance)
- source level debugger
- full 020 support

(and ofcourse MUCH more)


Last but not least there is the question what 2.5 will cost. Well,
I don't know myself: I'd like to sell it for a very low-profit price
so that everybody can easily affort it. probably this won't be much
more than the price for a shareware compiler. Also I'll plan on
distributing a PD demo version of v2.5.

so, I hope all this information gave some of you an insight of what's
coming... 

Greetings to all E programmers in the world,

Wouter.
