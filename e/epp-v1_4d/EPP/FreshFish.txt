        .description
        E Preprocessor.  Simple, easy-to-use macro preprocessor
        intended for use with Wouter van Oortmerssen's E language
        compiler, v2.1b.  Allows E programmer's to "include" (similar
        to C) E source code modules, thus adding modularity to the E
        language.  Update to v1.1, this release offers: twice the
        speed; many new options; directly calls the compiler;
        accurately reports errors; transparent handling of duplicate
        module and pmodule handling.
