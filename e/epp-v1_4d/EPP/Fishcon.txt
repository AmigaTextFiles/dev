Short:  E Preprocessor, "include" source modules.

EPP             E Preprocessor.  Simple, easy-to-use macro preprocessor
                intended for use with Wouter van Oortmerssen's E language
                compiler, v2.1b.  Allows E programmer's to "include" (similar
                to C) E source code modules, thus adding modularity to the E
                language.  Update to v1.1, this release offers: twice the
                speed; many new options; directly calls the compiler;
                accurately reports errors; transparent handling of duplicate
                module and pmodule handling.
                Any OS version.  FreeWare.
                Version 1.4d, binary and source.
