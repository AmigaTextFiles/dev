GETTING STARTED.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The directories in this archive have roughly the same structure as the
original E V2.1b distribution.

See E/Docs/EPP.doc for copyright notice, a full description of what EPP is,
and instructions on how to use EPP.

How to use the examples (CLI only):

    1.  Copy archive contents into the corresponding directories in which
        you have installed E.
    2.  CD to the E directory.
    3.  Make the following DOS assignments:

        PATH bin add  ;EC must be in your path.
        ASSIGN PMODULES: PModules

    4.  Example 1:

        a.  CD to the directory E/Sources/Examples/EPP_Example1.  Type:

            EPP mod0 ;This produces the E source program temp_main.e,
                     ; compiles it, and renames the executable to mod0

        b.  The program mod0 can now be run (although it will not do
            anything.)  You may have noticed that E echos EC's notifica-
            tion of the existence of unused identifiers (well, okay, all
            the identifiers in this example are unused.)  This example uses
            empty E structures in modules nested 5 deep to demonstrate what
            EPP can do.

        c.  You can run EPP in verbose mode by supplying the "-v" switch on
            the command line.  This will show the progress of module
            inclusion.

        d.  You can save the final source output by supplying the "-s"
            switch on the command line.  Then you can compare the original
            and final sources to get a feel for what is happening.  For a
            more readable final output, use the "-c" switch to tell EPP to
            put informative comments in the final output source.  You can
            name the final output file by specifying its name on the
            command line, otherwise EPP uses temp_main.e as the default.

    5.  Example 2:

        a.  CD to the directory E/Sources/Examples/EPP_Example2.

        b.  Type:

            EPP args_test
              ;This produces the E source program temp_main.e,
              ; compiles it, and renames the executable to args_test

        c.  The program main can now be run.  This example uses some real
            modules.  It accepts command-line arguments and displays the
            values.  Run it without arguments first to find out the usage.
            Then play with the arguments until you get a feel for what is
            happening.

        d.  Return to step b for each of the tests in the EPP_Example2
            directory.

EPP is very simple to use.  The examples provided should be adequate to
demostrate how to use EPP, but there are additional features which are
immediately evident.  Read EPP/Docs/EPP.doc for additional details and
hints, the copyright notice, and credits to others.
