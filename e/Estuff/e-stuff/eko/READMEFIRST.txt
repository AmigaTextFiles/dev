This is just a small addition.
Since 4.0 (this is 4.1), Eko has been optimised, to make it go faster.
I've had a look at both this and Type, and I can say that Eko is faster on displaying ascii, but is slower on displaying hex (don't be put off at all, this is still much better).
I've personally gone over my code, and I've gotten it as quick as I can be bothered to, and I've also made all of the read type routines asynchronous (makes it go faster) with the help of Michael Zucchi's Async.m module.
