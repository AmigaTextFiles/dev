@node intro "Who, how, why, where, when?"

        First of all I'm going to try to keep this AmigaGuide as short as I can, because 
long AmigaGuides are boring to read, and I have a tendency to ramble on in these 
things.
        @{b}Eko@{ub} is primarily a text viewing command. This is a small program 
( only about 6k in total ) which is a must for all CLI users, and anyone wanting 
command to help make up a disk ( i.e. colour backgrounds, align text, make text 
bold etc. ) . It makes using the CLI just a little bit more joyful. @{b}Eko@{ub} can 
:

        * Align text to the left, right or even centrally
        * change various colours in the CLI
        * format strings using bold, italic, and underlining
        * Display a file as HEX
        * Scroll all the text in the CLI up or down
        * Clear the text in the CLI
        * Make the @{"DisplayBeep" link "DisplayBeep"}
        * Display strings with a delay between the printing of each character

        This program was written totally with Amiga E ( I didn't use any Assembly 
blocks, 'cos I don't know how to ) , over quite a long time ( I kind of wrote it, left 
it, improved it, left it, re-wrote it, lost it. etc. ) , and was written primarily for my 
own personal use ( hence I kept leaving it to go back to it later ) .

@node author "I am Einstein"

        I am but a mere student, aged 16 and just about to go on to college to study 
Computing, Physics, and Mathematics at A - level, and RSA typing to fill up my 
time there. I like to listen to music ( specifically Iron Maiden, Metallica and Sacred 
Spirit, as if your hadn't guessed, I like bands like Sepultura Korn etc. but just not as 
much ) , I also like to go bowling ( ten pin ) , to cycle, to swim, to go out and 
have a good time, to watch Bottom, Beavis and Butthead, any film by Quentin Tarantino,
and obviously I like to program on my favourite computer, the Amiga.
        My heroes are undoubtedly Einstein, Beavis and Butthead, Richard Richard 
and Edward Elizabeth Hitler, Quentin Tarantino (the coolest man on earth?), and 
anyone who was ever cool.
        I can't stand "Bon Jovi" or anyone like that, who make their way into the rock 
charts, when the only people who like him also like pop music, which by the way I 
hate (pop music that is).

@node reqs "It needs 10 gigs of free RAM"
        In actual fact all this needs is just a 2.04 ( or greater ) machine, anything less 
and my beautiful program will refuse to run. I strongly recommend that you use it 
with a hard drive ( as I do for all programs ) , that is just 'cos having a hard drive 
is so effing marvellous.

@node "Usage" "Just smack a few keys and hope for the very best"
        If you can understand the Amiga DOS templates, then you can easily work 
out how to use this program, just type @{i}Eko ?@{ui} for an Amiga 
DOS template. The simplest thing you can do is to type @{i}Eko 
<filename>@{ui}. If you can't understand Amiga DOS templates, then you 
probably won't want to use this program.
        It won't take you long to find out about everything, if you just mess about a 
bit.
        Oh, you can stop it doing what ever it's doing by pressing Ctrl and C ( it will 
eventually stop trust me ).

@node bugs "The little green things that crawl around flashing little lights"

        I don't think there are any, and it works fine in every aspect for me, but if 
you do find any it's tough, so ha ha.
        The only slight bug is that in order to use the centre / right features, you 
must have the currently used CLI's window active. This is because I look at 
intuitition base to see what the active window is. This isn't too much of a problem, 'cos if
you're using this for presentation purposes (i.e. in disk magazines or something), then you can
find out the width of your console window, and specify it in the WIDTH parameter.

@node rexx "Your money or your life"
@next main

        The one thing that I can't stand more than just about anything else is when 
authors cripple there software in some way ( like annoying requester or timeouts or 
"removed save feature" ) , although it gets 'em money it plays hell with my head, 
and I don't know anyone who actually registers for these things. Most of the time 
they're either a load of crap, not worth the asked registration fee or thrown away 
as soon as they're seen, based on the fact that people can't use crippled programs. 
I know that the size of the program means that I would be far too cheeky to ask for 
money, so what I am going to do is just issue a plea to all software producers:
                        @{fg highlight}Inclued an arexx port if your program is large ( 
i.e. over 32k)
                        Keep the size of the program down to be as small as possible ( 
I've only got a small hard drive )
                        Try to make the program modular if it's gonna be large ( I've 
only got a 2 MB Amiga )
                        Include the source code ( I was struggling with Amiga E, and 
everything I had to learn from only half explained what I wanted to know )
                        Be cool, and treat others with the respect we all deserve@{fg text}

        Remember this:  Don't think you're not important,
                                You are everyman.

@node history "A brief history of time"
@next main
        So, you say this is version 4 of Eko, but I haven't even heard of this utility 'til 
now, what's happened to versions 1, 2, and 3?
        Well, versions 1 and 2 were never actually complete programs, they had 
several bugs, and most of the time were uncompiled pieces of text flying around 
my room.
        Version 1:      This version did very little, all it could do was print a document 
and change colours around a bit.
        Version 2:      This version did a bit more, adding the centre / right features
        Version 3:      This version incorporated the HEX option
        Version 4:      All bugs are removed and some simple features were added ( like 
BEEP and CLS etc.)

@node DisplayBeep ¿Qué?
        If you want to make the display beep without using the CLI, I suggest you use 
this program. This is another program I wrote, I wrote it 'cos there wasn't one 
already around, this is better to use if you don't intend on beeping the display 
from somewhere other than a CLI ( i.e. ToolsDaemon ) . I have included it with this 
package.
