@node intro "Allow me to introduce ..."
	This program does some stuff to your windows, like tiling, cascading etc.
	Sorry this is so short, but I hate wrting these things.
@endnode
@node use "Shake three times, stir, and drink"
	Double click on the icon to get it going. The press any of the tooltypes for the desired effect.
	Tooltypes:
			CASCADE= CTRL SHIFT C	- will cascade your windows
			RCASCADE= CTRL SHIFT R	- will casacde your windows, but this time to the right, WOW!
			TILE = CTRL SHIFT T		- will tile your windows
			HORTILE = CTRL SHIFT H	- will tile your windows horizontally
			VERTILE = CTRL SHIFT V	- will tile your windows vertically
			CLOSE = CTRL SHIFT K	- will close all of the open windows
			MINIMIZE = CTRL SHIFT M	- will minimize all of the windows
			MAXIMIZE = CTRL SHIFT N - will maximize all of the windows
			MOVEDOWN = CTRL SHIFT DOWN		- will move all of the windows to the bottom of the screen
			MOVEUP = CTRL SHIFT UP	- will move all of the windows to the top of the screen
			MOVELEFT = CTRL SHIFT LEFT	- will move all of the windows to the left of the screen
			MOVERIGHT = CTRL SHIFT RIGHT	- will move all of the windows to the right of the screen

P.S. give my program a try for a week, and I bet you'll love it. And when I say a week I mean use it!!!
P.P.S. It can't close CLI windows, I don't know why, and I don't know how to fix it, it's something another program not too dissimilar to this can't do either.
