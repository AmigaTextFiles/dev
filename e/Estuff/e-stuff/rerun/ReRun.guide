@node intro Allow me to introduce
	This program was written with low - end users in mind. If you find that it is very difficult to get certain games running on you computer, due to a lack of memory, then this program might just the answer you were looking for.

	It couldn't be easier, well it probably could, but this is as easy as I could make it. 
	First put this command somewhere usefull (like the C: assign), you then make sure the program you wish to start's icon isn't a TOOL, but instead a PROJECT (in most cases you can use IconEdit or you could use IconPos (supplied). Then change the program's DEFAULT TOOL to ReRun (select Information from the Icons menu). The last thing you'll need to do is to add this line to the very begining of you Startup-Script. Now, next time you double click on that icon, your system will reboot, and that program will startup. Oh, and by the way, if your program needs somethings setting up, then simply write a script for that, give it an icon, and treat it in the same way as an ordinary program.
	I hope that's clear enough for you, 'cos I'm crap at expaining things. If it isn't then oh dear.
