@node intro "Introducing from sunny California..."
  This program will convert IFF brushes into source code for use with AmigaE. It 
is a program which I wrote, and I often find it very useful. I reccomend that you 
don't πgenerally try to use pictures that are larger than 100 x 100 pixels across, this 
is for two reasons:
  * it'll take quite a long time to convert it from IFF to E
  * it'll make your compiled program massive in sive (which I will hate)
It is freeware, so use it as you wish, but if you want to pass on this useful program, 
make sure you include the entire archive, and don't think about altering my code, 
and redistributing it (I'll kick your ass).

π you may in some cases find you need to use pictures that are bigger than this, 
Brush2E can cope with pictures as big as your memory will permit, but in the 
interest of keeping file sizes to a minimum, I suggest you don't use massive 
pictures.

  You should only need OS 2.04, but you are limited to the size of the picture 
by the amount of memory you have. However I can use any picture size that *I 
want to* on my 2 Mb Amiga.

P.S. I strongly reccomend a hard drive if you haven't already got one, everything 
becomes so much simpler, you'll be able to use hard drive only programs, and if 
you've only got a floppy based system, you're a menace to the Amiga community.

  I've only just noticed this at the very last minute. Unfortunately I've been using LoadRGB4() to do all the hard work, but after carefully testing this program, I've found that LoadRGB4() loads colours in a similar way to a non AGA Amiga. Although it doesn't make a difference if you've already got the palette (e.g. MWB palette), it does make a big difference if you're using this program as the main source of colour translation.
  IF you like this program, and find it's not quite as flexible as you'd like it, I suggest you check out ArtPro by Frank Pagels (I prefer TO use that).

  Tell me something, how in God's name (no I'm not religious) did you make 
your way to reading this bit?
