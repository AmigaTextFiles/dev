    Hello there! I'm glad you managed to find this gem of an archive. This bit of text is just a brief intro to me and this archive.
    What you've got here is a selection of programs (at the time of writing, all CLI), which'll be useful to anyone who has even a remotely technical@{π link π} use for the Amiga@{≤ link ≤}, and could be very useful for any budding programmer (you'll have to excuse the messy code). If you've got this far through the text without quitting, then it proves (I hope) that you're willing to give my programs a try. @{b}*Don't be put of by these programs for at least a week.*@{ub} if you use these programs for a week, then I'm sure you'll consider some of them essential. I myself can't do without a number of them.
    The programs were all born out of my @{u}need@{uu} for a certain utility that I hadn't got, and I haven't wrote them just for the fun of it. I'm sure you'll find them useful, for example the DisplayBeep command can be used in ToolsDaemon, the Eko command (amazing program --- keep this on 'yer @{harddrive link "Wot no 'ardrive?"}) is useful for anyone who uses the shell, and it could have a useful place on a self-booting disk.
    If you've used my programs for a week and you still don't like them then you may get rid of them, but I my self have completely disregarded programs only to go back to them many months later to find they're the best thing since sliced bread.
    My inspiration for these programs came from Beavis & Butthead, Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955 R.I.P.), Steven Hawking, The cast of Friends, Martin Cloones, Curry, Quentin Tarantino, Richard Richard and Edward Elizabeth Hitler, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Mega Death (et al), the Amiga@{≤ link ≤}, Beer ...... (I think you get the picture)

P.S.    Thanks for putting up with this text, I get a bit carried away. If you've managed to read it all, then you can consider that you achived a great thing today.

    Phew, that's this crap out of the way now I think I'd better get that important thing that needed doing done.

    When I say technical (for want of a better word), all I mean is someone who knows at bit more about the Amiga than the average "errr... 'ow 'ja format a diskø" owner.

    One thing a lot of Amiga owners can't admit is that the Amiga has been dead for quite some time, but the emergence of new technology (maybe the PowerPC, but only maybe) could herald a new era for the Amiga. An OS 4, tower (et al), super processors, graphics boards etc. could revolutionise the way most people see a PC as only being an IBM compatible computer running the very latest version of Windows (95's been a massive improvement but it's still not a touch on the good old Amiga OS). One of the main ways to reestablish their market would have to be to introduce games the like of which most Amigans can only dream of, and a good suite of office proggys (to win against Office '97).
    I hope that one day soon, the Amiga will wipe out the virtual monopoly (be careful what you say Goody) that Microsoft has on the world.

    'Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing.  But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing.  The theory says a lot but, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the "old one".  I, at any rate, am convinced that He is not playing at dice.'

    If you haven't got a harddrive then you can just go into a dark corner, dribble and say "I am a sinner please don't let the lord himself bring eternal damnation upon my pert little buttocks". In other words YOU'RE THE VERY PERSON THAT'S PULLING THE AMIGA DOWN. If you ain't got something like RAM expansions, then I can understand (I'm running on a tight budget myself).
