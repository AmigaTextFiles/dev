@{fg highlight}   EFORM
@{fg text}

  This program will format E source into indented E source, just specify and input and an output file.

P.S. At the time of writing this document, the program could not format source back into the same file, but after a bit, I might go back to the code, and implement the ability to format to the input source, it's just that I hate writing docs, and I've already written this one, I'm not going to do it again!
