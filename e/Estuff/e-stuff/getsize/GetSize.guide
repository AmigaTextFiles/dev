      GetSize
              By Steven Goodgrove


  This program was written for two reasons, one was that I'd wanted a CLI getsize command, and two, is that it is really useful to put into a ToolsDaemon menu.

P.S. When you specify dirs, it will display all of the directories, that is even the one you specified, that way there'll always be at least one dir.
