@node warning "General user warning"

Sorry for my bad English, I think you have fun with it.

@{b}WARNING ! This program uses MUI, if you hate it, delete it with following words:

    "I hate it, it's perverse !"@{ub}

If it doesn't matter, don't say that I didn't warn you !

    Yours sincerly,

@node whatis "What is FinalExecute ?"

Do you know "Execute command..." at your WB menu ? Yes, it sucks, you don't
need  it  !  But  FinalExecute will replace this menu point ! You are still
thinking you won't need it ? Okay, you are perhaps running  a  "nice"  tool
which replace it, but are you really sure ? Test it, you will not regret it
! :-)

Look at it's @{"features" link features} !

@endnode

@node features "Features"

    Very short: the features:

    - command caching (for command repetition, also called command history buffer)
    - optional automatic shell creation
    - name completion with Tab expanding with multi-path scan
    - drag'n'drop
    - file requester
    - options for setting current directory, output redirection, stack size,
      priority, shell name, optional excluding of .info files
    - data type recognition (requires datatypes.library V45 or higher by R.Mainz or
                             a compatible)
    - "text editor"-like input
    - flash execution function (erase input line and fill with drag'n'drop'ed
                                icon path)
    - ARexx port

@endnode

@node requirements "Requirements"

    It requires:

    - OS 3.0 or higher, because I'm using some new functions

    - muimaster.library at version 11, that means MUI3.0 or higher

    - ca. 64 KByte free HD space

    additionally recommended:

    - at least 1 MB memory

    - at least MC68020 CPU

    - datatypes.library V45 or higher, by Roland Mainz, available at AmiNet,
      or a compatible

      The datatypes.library (or the compatible) has to know toolnodes !

@endnode

@node installation "Installation"

There is an Installer script included, please double-click on it, to execute it.

@endnode

@node usage "Usage"

Main points of usage:

    @{"Starting" link usage_start}
    @{"Quitting" link usage_end}
    @{"Tooltypes" link usage_tooltypes}
    @{"Graphical user interface" link usage_gui}
    @{"Menus" link usage_menu}
    @{"Keyboard" link usage_keyboard}
    @{"ARexx port" link usage_arexx}

@endnode

@node usage_start "Starting"

    You can start it in three ways:

        - by double-clicking at the icon
        - by CLI
        - by WBStartup, after LoadWB

    By changing @{"tooltypes" link usage_tooltypes} you can set some base options.

    Because it's a MUI  tool  you  can  change  all  the  commodity  stuff,
    interface look a.s.o. with MUI.

    At the first there will be a small window at the middle of your screen,
    you can resize it, move it and fix it by clicking at the MUI button in the
    window dragbar.

@endnode

@node usage_end "Quitting"

    Because  every  MUI  application  is  a  commodity,  you  can  use  the
    Commodore(RIP) tool "Exchange" to quit it.

    Or you can choose the menu point "Quit" at the project menu.

@endnode

@node usage_tooltypes "Tooltypes"

  CX_PRIORITY   -   the call priority for commoditys` system, default:0

  CX_ENVHOTKEY  -   in contrast to normal hotkey, this key combination
                    will open the window on frontmost screen (normally
                    only WB screen). The normal MUI hotkey will work further.
                    If they are both the same, it doesn`t matter.
                    Default: RCommand shift e

  MAXLASTINPUTS -   maximum amount of entries at the command cache,
                    default: 32 entries, every entry allocates max. 1 KByte memory

  DTLEVEL       -   a numeric value between 0 and 2,

                    0: means  standard  datatypes.library,   program   will
                       disable datatype recognisation feature

                    1: means a  compatible  datatypes.library  type,  which
                       supports toolnodes for datatype recognisation

                    2: means datatypes.library V45 or  higher  by  R.Mainz,
                       which supports toolnodes

                    Be careful of your choice, a too high level could crash
                    your    machine,    e.g.    you   have   the   old   C=
                    datatypes.library and you enter level higher than 0.

  HELPFILE      -   name and path of program`s guide file (help file)

@endnode

@node usage_gui "Graphical user interface"

Input string gadget
-------------------

    It gives you a space for 1 KByte input text, this must be enough for 95
    % of all inputs. but it could @{"change" link todo} something.

    With the cursor keys, you can walk up  and  down  through  the  command
    history  buffer  (command  cache).  With  the  Tab key you can call the
    @{"Tab expanding" link usage_tabexpand}  function.

    If you drag some icons over it, the full name including the path,  will
    be inserted at cursor place.

    Right beside it there is a little file-requester popup-gadget,  if  you
    click  on it, a file requester appears where you can choose one or more
    files or a path which will be inserted at the current cursor place.


Less:
-----

      - this gadget allows free access to the command cache,
        a list will appear where you also can walk up and down
        with cursor keys.

NewShell:
---------

      - a press on it will create a new shell

Ok
--
      - executes the line in the input string gadget

Cancel
------

      - closes the window without executing the input line

@endnode

@node usage_menu "Menus"

Project menu
------------

      - About
        -----

        A requester with program informations appears.

      - About MUI
        ---------

        Service for unregistered users of MUI: you can register yourself here. :)

      - Hide
        ----

        Closes the window but doesn't quit the program.

      - Quit
        ----

        Quits the program




Options menu
------------

      - Scan assignlist:
        ----------------

       @{"Tab expanding" link usage_tabexpand} scans also the  assign  list
       (also multiple assigns).

      - Scan WB pathes:
        ---------------

        @{"Tab expanding" link usage_tabexpand} scans also the WB pathes

      - Datatype scan:
        --------------

        If you insert a file by @{"Tab  expanding"  link  usage_tabexpand},
        file  requester  or drag'n'drop into the empty input string gadget,
        then it will be tried to recognise the datatype of the file and the
        tool  or,  if  more  than  one  available, the choosen tool will be
        inserted before the file name.

        This menu point will be disabled if DTLEVEL is 0.

      - Include .info files:
        --------------------

        If .info (icon) should be included in all operations then give this
        point a hook.

      - Flash execution:
        ----------------

        If you dropped an icon over the programs AppIcon, then it would  be
        useful  to  have an ampty line, so you only need to press return in
        some cases, extremely useful in connection with "Datatype scan": If
        both  points  are "hooked", then you only need to drop the picture,
        sound, text or whatever about the AppIcon, the window opens and  in
        most  cases  (if  tool has been added before the filename) you need
        only to press Return.


      - Edit options:
        -------------
            An options window will be called with many string gadgets:

            - Output:
              -------

              - the output for the actual command, mostly a  CON:  or  RAW:
              window, but could be also a file

            - Current directory:
              ------------------

              - as  the  name  says,  the  system  will  change  into  this
              directory before execution

            - Stack:
              ------

              - you can change the stack size for the actual command

            - Priority:
              ----------

              - you can set the command for the process to be created, must
              be -128 to 127, please don't go out of range between -5 to 5,
              the system could get very confused, that  means  an  extremly
              high slowdown.

            - Shell name:
              ------------

              - if there is an opened shell, you can  use  it  for  output,
              enter the name here


      - Save
        ----

        Saves the options at the options menu into a file.

      - Reload
        ------

        Loads all options back.

@endnode

@node usage_keyboard "Keyboard"

    Tabulator key   - is for @{"Tab-Expandings" link usage_tabexpand} in the input string gadget.

    Cursor up/down  - is for walking up and down in the command cache
                      (command history)

       Return/Enter - is for executing the line in the input string  gadget
                      or  for  activating next string gadget in the command
                      options editor.

                  O - like Return/Enter with inactive input string gadget

                  N - closes the window but doesn't execute the command

    Right Amiga + ? - Opens the "About" window.

    Right Amiga + ! - Opens the MUI promottion and register window

    Right Amiga + O - Edit command options

    Right Amiga + S - Save all actual options

    Right Amiga + R - Reload last saved options

@endnode

@node usage_arexx "ARexx port"

    The ARexx port is "FINALEXECUTE".

    Okay, it's only one command, but better one than no command:

    - CALLREQ - opens the program window

    Parameters:INPUTSTRING/K  -  Initial string for the input string gadget
                                 E.g.: CALLREQ INPUSTRING="'dir opt a'"

               PUBLICSCREEN/K -  String which  represents  the  name  of  a
                                 public  screen  where  the  window  should
                                 open.

                                 E.g.: CALLREQ PUBLICSCREEN="Workbench"


@endnode

@node usage_tabexpand "Tab-Expanding"

    What's Tab expanding ?
    ----------------------

    A loved feature of some Unix tools like XEmacs is the automatical  name
    completion after pressing the Tab key.

    That's the whole secret. The same does FinalExecute.

    But how to use this feature ?
    -----------------------------

    Simply enter  a  name  fragment  and  press  Tab.  If  the  search  was
    successfully,  then  then  the name will be completed or you can choose
    between two or more matches.

    You can also DOS patterns.

    What could be better ?
    ----------------------

    - search option
    - tooltype option for more string memory (?)

Senseless options like railway station, wind power station or  a  hyperlink
to the homepage of Argue will never be implemented.

@node bugs "Known problems/bugs/hints"

    - no bugs known

Problems:

    The datatypes.library V45  creates  also  icons  for  internal  classes
    (movie, document, exe etc.), this could be very slow to recognize files
    of type "program". I implemented an own recognition for programs.

@node thx "Thanks"

Thanks goes to:

    Ralph Babel

    - for his help and much tips, especially  to  kill  all  patch  things,
    although  they  made  unimaginable comfortable, but this is unclean and
    riskful, of course ;-)

    Michael "mlelstv" van Elst

    -  for  his  three-hour-very-hard-WB-path-discussion,  okay,  it's  not
    possible  to do a 100 % clean WB-CurrentDir changenotify, so it must be
    a dream ;-|

    Oliver "olk" Knorr

    - for his crass statements for the theme "patch" ;->

    Tino "cdTv" Wildenhain

    - "Your wish was my command, Master", all GUI styles are  done  as  you
    wished ;-)
