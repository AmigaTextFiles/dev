Quick Reference "Plugin_TextImageButton.m"  © 1996 by Sebastian Hesselbarth


+--------- --- -- - -  Introduction

This Archive contains a PLUGIN written for the AmigaE-GUI-Designer
called EasyGUI ! It has been compiled with AmigaE-version 3.2e and I think
you need at least this version (> 3.2a) to use this module !
So if you don't have this version contact your national E distibutor to
buy/upgrade you AmigaE compiler. (Greetings to Joerg Wach ;) )

Right... I wrote this module to make it possible for EasyGUI programmers to
use images and buttons with images in their EasyGUIs.
I think Wouter wants to include this kind of buttons in EasyGUI, so feel free
to contact me Wouter :)

The programs and modules in this archive are
Copyright © 1996 by Sebastian Hesselbarth.

Further the Plugin_TextImageButton module and the source are dedicated to
  the author of the AmigaE language Wouter van Oortmerssen ...

You are free to include the module in your programs, whether free-/pubilc-
share-/"whatever"-ware or commercial. 
The only thing that's a must is that the archive must be complete and must
contain all files unmodified if you want to redistibute it.
TO ALL PD-DISK-SELLERS WHICH TAKE MORE THAN 3DM FOR ONE DISK :
 "F**K YOU AND THANK GOD THAT YOUR CUSTOMERS DON'T KNOW THE WORLD OF AMINET !"

I make no guaranties that this module is totally bug-free or work as expected.
This module is not really betatested so if you find any bug/error : contact me!

Finally I must say that it is your _own_ risk if you use this module and your
AMIGA® travels in to the deepest abysses of the Himalaya. (Greets 2 the GURU ;)
Or you harddisk reaches the NIRVANA while you use my program.
In this case I can only say : "sorry pals!". ;)

+--------- --- -- - -  Requirements

* You need at least OS 2.0 (Upgrade pals !)
* For programing you need AmigaE v3.2a+
* Some ESources with images in it ! I'm glad to tell you that I can do this
  for YOU ! Simple send me a disk (no emails yet :.(( ) with images in IFF
  format and I'll convert 'em. Don't forget to put backstamps in the cuvert!
  I hope the answer will be as quick as possible !

+--------- --- -- - -  Usage

This module uses the standard PLUGIN routines (are there any other ? ;)
so you only ... have to look up in my example source or any other 
source that uses plugins ...

The easiest way is this :

DEF tib : PTR TO textimagebutton_plugin

easygui('Title',
  ...
  [PLUGIN, 1, NEW tib.init (image,secondimage,tags)
  ...
  
Where "tib" is a pointer to "textimagebutton_plugin" :)
You must start "tib" with the "init" procedure ... the arguments are :

image           = A pointer to a memory area that contains an "image" structure
secondimage     = ^^^ or NIL if you don't want a secondimage
tags            = standard tagslist (TAGS below)

EPTIB_BORDER            = TRUE if you want to use an xtra border around your
  image , FALSE if not. Default is TRUE, automatically set if EPTIB_TEXT 
  is <> NIL.

EPTIB_TEXT              = if you want to have a text in your button you have
  to enter a text after this TAG.

EPTIB_FONT              = wants a PTR to a "textattr" structure 
  for example : ['topaz.font',8,0,0]:textattr.
  If not set the button will use screen font.

EPTIB_IMGPOS            = Defines the position of the image ...
  EPTIB_IPOSRIGHT       =   use this to put the image right of your text
  EPTIB_IPOSLEFT        =   ^^                        left  ^^
  EPTIB_IPOSTOP         =   ^^                        above ^^    
  EPTIB_IPOSBOTTOM      =   ^^                        under ^^
EPTIB_BGNORMAL          = defines the background of the button in normal state
EPTIB_BGSELECTED        = ^^                                     pressed state
EPTIB_RESIZE            = EPTIB_RESIZENONE, EPTIB_RESIZEX, EPTIB_RESIZEY ...
  use them to define whether and how your button should resize, use
  ..NONE for fixed size, ..RESIZEX for x only and ..RESIZEY for y only
  stretching. combined x and y resizing : ..RESIZEY OR ..RESIZEY
  (.. means EPTIB_RESIZE..)


It's so simple isn't it ? Anyway you have problems with it contact me ...

The best thing is to look up in my example sources !!
