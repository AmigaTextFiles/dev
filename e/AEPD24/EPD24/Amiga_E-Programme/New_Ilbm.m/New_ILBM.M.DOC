Hi everyone,

I was using the ilbm.m module recently, using it for an iff->raw
converter for a game i've just started writing .. anyway i found a
rather nasty TINY bug in ilbm_Dispose().  So i fixed it ...

I recall something bout Wouter being 'out of town' so to speak,
otherwise i'd have mailed him the fix ...

Anyway, here's the official update to ilbm.m, it shoud be added to
EMODULES:tools/ilbm.m and also to the next official AmigaE release.
