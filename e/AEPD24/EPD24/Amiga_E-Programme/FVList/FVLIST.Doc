Hello fellow E-users,

Here's another Object oriented class (they're growing out of the
windows lately :) for you to enjoy, use, abuse, whatever...

It's a kind of linked list.
No wait!!! I hear you mumbling already...
But this one is no ordinary linked list.  It's a bit more efficient
than the usual stuff.
Instead of holding a speech about the advantages, I'll give you the
structure, so you can figure out some things for yourself.

The main handle of the list is an FVList object, which holds no node
data, but simply list-information:

it has:
    child   -> the first node
    parent  -> NIL, naturally
    root    -> itself
    tail    -> the last node, for adding nodes fast

a node is of the type FVNode, which holds no data (you should derive
data-holding nodes for yourself)

it has:
    child   -> next node
    parent  -> previous node (or root for first node)
    root    -> the root, the FVList handle

member functions implemented (hopefully bug-free) are:

- make(PTR TO fvlist) of fvnode
    a constructor that initialises an fvnode

- make(dummyvalue) of fvlist
    a constructor that initialises the root fvlist

- the root fvlist can be destructed using
    END root     (assuming root is the PTR TO fvlist)
  , which will destruct all linked nodes, free their memory and free
    the root itself including it's memory

- free() of fvnode
    frees the node you call it with and all it's children, updates
    the tail of the root and some other stuff, so that the list is
    always valid. (I call this an amputation :)

- delete() of fvnode
    discards a node from the list, linking together the pieces it
    left behind, as if that node never existed. memory is freed for
    that node, etc.

- giveChild() of fvnode,fvlist
    echo the child

- giveParent() of fvnode,fvlist
    echo the parent

- giveTail()
    guess what...

- some adding function too


Hope you do something useful with it.

In the possible case that you encounter some bug(s) in it, I'd like
to hear from it definitely!
I tested it, and it seemed to work fine, but I wouldn't bet on it I
made no mistake :)

Have fun,

Frank,
