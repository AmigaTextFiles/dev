                        DopeE V2.3 by Juan Boulter

                *******************************************


26-07-95

First of all I would like to thank Wouter van Oortmerssen
for the Amiga E v3.1a Compiler and E programming language on the AMIGA.


INTRODUCTION
------------

This program was written as an experiment with the E programming
environment. (Actually DopeE is experiment No.3.)
I am slowly teaching myself how to program on the AMIGA.
I believe the AMIGA computer is superior to all others. (But that is just
personal preferance. Some people are severly misled.)
Anyway, please try DopeE and see what you think.

I have been toying with the Idea of becoming a well known E programmer
for quite a while now. I quess, ever since the day I found Fish #810
on a CDPD CD.(can't remember which one....) Anyway Amiga E looked like
an easy language to learn so I set to it.(Slowly I might add)

As my zest for programming progressed, so too my thirst for an easier
way to do things. I discovered Ez_E by Kevin Connell. My great thanks
to Kevin for helping me with my quest. Unfortunately I have outgrown
Ez_E. I'm sorry Kevin but Ez_E just doesn,t do enough for me anymore.
Hence DopeE(silly name, but thats all I could think of at the time.)
was born. I thought to myself `If I'm going to experiment; why not
create something useful?'

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- An Amiga with at least 6 meg ram and a 040 or higher processor.
- About 520 megs of HD space
- Kickstart and WorkBench 3.1


Nah, just kidding. ;) It should work on any Kickstart 2.0+ Amiga. 
If it doesn't, then please contact me.

I have but an A500 with an A590(49meg scsi), 1meg CHIP and 2meg FAST.
A very loyal friend is my Amiga. One day I might get another but never
a replacement.

DopeE has also been tested on Geoff Scheiman's A1200 standard with no
adverse effects. (Thank you Geoff....For all your suggestions and advice.)

DopeE also requires you to have a few directories assigned.
ie. ESource: EModules: EDocs: EBin: GadToolsBox:
In your Libs: DopeE requires ReqTools.Library 38+ and GadTools.Library 38+
Yes and it would help if you had the Amiga E V3.1a programming package.

USAGE
-----

DopeE will run by double-clicking on it's icon and will multitask
with the best of them.
DopeE will not however detach if run from a CLI.
The DopeE window has 13 button gadgets and 2 string gadgets. Each gadget
should be fairly self explanitory, but the use of each is as follows:...

Source Editor: This will open your editor. It will present you a file requestor,
               and all you need to do is locate your current work file.  It will
               automatically pass the name of this file to your editor. DopeE
               assumes you have an editor named ED in the C: Directory.

Compile Source: This button will compile your program. All output from the 
                compiler will appear in the 'DopeE IO window' so you can see what
                it is doing.
                ** Note: that you should have selected a project with editor
                before using this button, but if you didn't, it will ask you to
                select a project.
                ** Note: You can add a command line string in the string gadget
                to the right of this button. This command line is passed to EC.
                ** AnotherNote: Pressing the ? button will show you all the
                arguments that EC will accept.

Execute Binary: This will (attempt to) run the program you are currently working
                on with optional command line arguments.
                If you have not opened a project with the editor or the compiler
                button, it will ask you to select a project. Currently opens a
                small screen window(DopeE Guardian) to run your program in.
                (Maybe you need a window to pass the odd WriteF() to. I know I do.)
                ** Note: you can add a command line string in the string gadget to
                the right of this button. This command line is passed to your
                program.

Bump Revision: This button will give you the choice of either createing a new
               version string, bumping the version # or bumping the revision #.
               In the event that you have not started on a project, DopeE will
               ask you to do so. If you don't have Bumpee in EBin: DopeE will
               ask you to place it there. All output from Bumpee will appear in
               the 'DopeE IO window' so you can see what it is doing.

TOOLS: This button launches another bank of buttons that contains a list of
       Useful operations. ie. GadToolsBox,SrcGen,Version,MoveFile,CopyFile,
       RenameFile,DeleteFile and SnoopDos. These buttons will do as you might
       have guessed. I'll explain the four buttons you may not understand.
GadToolsBox: This button will look for GadToolsBox in the GadToolsBox: Directory.
             In the event GadToolsBox is found, It will be run.
SrcGen: This button will bring up a requester for you to choose a .gui file
        generated by GadToolsBox. If SrcGen is found in the EBin: Directory,
        a new E Source will be generated and placed in the ESource Directory
        for you to edit and compile.
Version: This gadget will look for Version in the C: directory. If Version is
         found, you will be presented with a file requestor, and all you need 
         to do is locate the file you require the version of. If no file is
         selected then you will be presented with the Kickstart and Workbench
         version. If Version is not found in C: DopeE will do ask you to place
         it there.
SnoopDos: This gadget will look for SnoopDos in the C: Directory and if
          found will be run. For those of you who know not what SnoopDos is.
          SnoopDos is a very comprehensive system monitor.

ShowMod: This will show you the commands available in a particular Emodule.
         It will present you a file requestor, and all you need to do is locate
         the E Module you wish to view. It will automatically pass all infomation
         to the 'DopeE IO window' so you can see what you need to know.
         If you don't have ShowModule in EBin: DopeE will ask you to place it there.

?: This button simply shows you all the arguments that are accepted by EC.
   To understand thier function you should read the Amiga E docs.

&: This button will abort the current project. (just in case you decide you
   started on the wrong piece of source code.)

FlushMem: This gadget will look for Flush in the C: directory. If found your
          available memory will be flushed. If Flush is not found DopeE will
          do an Avail flush. (I think everybody should have Avail in C:)

ClrCache: This gadget will look for FlushCache in the EBin: directory. If found,
          the memory used by EC to hold E's modules, will be flushed. If FlushCache
          is not found DopeE will ask you to place it in EBin:

ABOUT: Have a guess......

FUNAMBULIST: (What an odd name fo a button.....) This button tries to
             read a configuration file(S:LaunchPro.config). If the
             correct config file exists, you will be presented with a
             button bar consisting of up to 12 buttons. The first two
             buttons are,
Smart: This button is here to do anything the other buttons can not.
       eg. Launch a program, Read a doc etc. On sellection of a file,
       DopeE with endevour to act appropriately. If DopeE has no idea
       what type of file you have selected then you will be asked what 
       you would like to do with the file.
       ie. HexRead?(xMore), Launch?, Listen?(SmartPlay), Hear?(Play16)
       View?(FastView) What happens next is anyones guess???
       (I use external programs like these to reduce the size of DopeE.)
Edit: This button will launch your editor with S:LaunchPro.config so you
      can edit the remaining 10 buttons. Funambulist will support any
      number of buttons from 1 to 10. An example of LaunchPro.config should
      have come with your copy of DopeE V2.3.
Buttons 1 to 10: These buttons will do just what you have told them to do
                 in S:LaunchPro.config

E DOCS: If you have assigned EDocs: then this button will use xMore to read
        E.doc. DopeE looks for xMore in C: If xMore is not found in C: then
        DopeE will ask you to place it there.

DEBUG: This button will launch EDBG using your current project so you can
       debug your program. If EDBG is not found in EBin: then DopeE will
       ask you to place it there. When I get it to work!!

	I strongly advise the use of KingCON by David Larsson. KingCON will
        (apart from other advantages) allow you to retrace the history in DopE IO.

     **If you have any problems please don't hesitate to contact me.**

HISTORY (begins 29-05-95)
-------

	V1.0 - Simply a GUI generated with Srcgen.(Thank you 
	V1.1 - I got the main buttons working corectly.
         ie. Source Editor,Compile Source and Execute Binary.
	V1.2 - It took me a while, but I got Bump Revision to work
         the way I wanted.
	V1.3 - The rest of the buttons were rellatively easy,
         but DEBUG doesn,t work.
	V1.4 - I threw in a few helpful requesters.
	V1.5 - Made DopeE smaller by making some of the code shorter.
         In other words I optomised it a little by way of a more
         prorammer like programming style. DEBUG still doesn,t work.
	V1.6 - The DEBUG button works now!!
  V1.7 - Added the version button.(just a personal thing but you might find
         it useful.) Some other minor tweeking was undertaken just for the
         heck of it.
	V1.8 - Added a new button bar launched from that button I had no use for
         ie. *Juan*.
	V1.9 - Moved the version button to the othe button bar and made the ClrCache
         button.
	V1.10 - I was loosing the current project after using one of my extra tools
         buttons. Took a while but that doesn't happen anymore.
	V1.11 - Added the ? button because I was sick of looking elsewhere.
	V1.12 - I made the Bump Revision button move the module it created to
         the EModules:Bump Directory. Also SrcGen moves the E source it creates
         to the ESource Directory. Saves a lot of time those two little extras.
	V1.13 - I had to make DopeE go to sleep while the othe button bars were
         active, because I found that DopeE still accepted gadget presses and
         they would all happen after the extra button bar was gone. It's even
         got a busy pointer. Oh yer! DopeE handles up to five projects at once.
         I don't know when I did that but there it is.
         Woops...Last minute addition. A random memory display.
	V2.00 - Smart button now recognises .doc, .jpg, .lha, .lzx
         Added a copy .info feature to the copy file button.
         Added a copy over file if file already exists feature to the
         copy file button.
         Added an ask before delete feature to delete file button.
         Fixed a few minor bugs.
	V2.1 - Smart button now recognises .doc, .guide, .jpg, .gif,
         .lha, .lzx, .8svx, .mod
         Added a replace file if file already exists feature to the move file
         button.
	V2.2 - Added an abort current project button.
	V2.3 - Added Funambulist button. (ala QuickLaunch.e distributed with
         Amiga E archive. THANK YOU Wouter.)
         Renamed *Juan* button to TOOLS. (More appropriate, don't you think?)
         Moved smart button to funambulist button bar.
         I finally found out how to use the dos library so now DopeE copies,
         moves, deletes and renames internaly.
         (This was an exciting update.)

TODO
----

- Have DopeE detach from a CLI.
- Get the SMART? button to be smarter.
  (Only recognises .doc, .guide, .gif, .8svx, .mod, .jpg, .lha, .lzx
  and executable files)
  Files that require arguments should not be run with the SMART? button
  because there is no output.
- A calculator?
- Additional tools. Maybe we won't need any other programs.....
- Maybe make the code even shorter. (In my dreams!)
- Your suggestions??

COPYRIGHT
---------

DopeE is an Anyware program. Maybe someone might like it enough to
send me money?? This not the case I will accknowledge any form of
recognition. A post card, strip-a-gram, slab of beer...........anything!
If you're the author of an shareware program, and you
REALLY want to thank me (can't imagine why...) then send me a
registered version of your program. That's not asking too much, is it?

Here I must again impress apon you the fact that I am still just a beginner
at this, so please don't laugh at DopeE. 

I can change the name on the *Juan* button for people who register DopeE.
Yes and I will also send updates to registered users.

DISCLAIMER
----------

I hold no resposibility for any damage done by DopeE to your computer or
your software. It works fine for me so I thought I'd just share it around.

P.S. I am very proud of this program because it is the first
     I have written that is actually very usefull. (I use DopeE
     to update itself and have done since version 1.1)
