Hello Folks :))

This is my (DMX) convertion of Reaction for PowerD. If you wanna use it, just simply copy
the contents of the modules drawer to D:modules. There are 2 example programs included, which I
put in the examples drawer. Check it out :)

Thanks to Martin Kuchinka for making PowerD and for a lot of help, making Reaction work with PowerD.
