Subject: ADMIN: Posting guidelines

A couple of weeks ago there were a lot of messages going back and forth
about the nature of contributions to this list. I thought that it might
be helpful to remind everyone of the original intent of this list and
give a few guidelines for posting.

THE AMIGAE MAILING LIST:

The list was formed in the late spring of 1993 to serve as a forum for
those using the Amiga E programing language. The purpose was and is to
put together both experts and beginners to exchange coding ideas, source
code and tools, toward the dual goals of helping the Amiga E language
to grow into maturity, and for us to grow into better Amiga E programmers.

POSTING GUIDELINES:

1. Try to keep in mind that your posts to the list go out to over 100
people located around the world. Many of these pay for their email
services, and international email is in general an expensive enterprise
for someone, even if not for the end user. If your posting is of a 
personal nature, or is part of a discussion with just one or two list 
members, consider using private email to continue the dialog. Always
be aware that what you post to the list should be of interest to the
majority of list members. 

2. Stay on topic! This list is for the discussion of Amiga E. 

3. Please try to be polite in both your posts and your responses. Flaming 
(though we haven't seen this here, yet), will not be tolerated and can 
get a member removed from the list in a hurry. It has no place in a forum 
such as this one. 

4. If you choose to reply to a list message, be sure to trim quoted
text as much as possible. Again, this is a matter of courtesy as both 
members who pay for mail by the character and those who read it over
slow modem connections do not appreciate 100 lines of quoted text for
a three line reply. (Those of us reading it over fast connections don't
appreciate it much, either.) 

5. Source of less than 250 lines may be posted to the list in plain text,
and you are encouraged to do so. This makes discussion of the source and
questions about it much easier to accomplish for other list members. 
Longer source, or that which is contained in several files, should be
archived into either a lha or lzh archive, then uuencoded and sent to
the list. For really large postings, over 20K or so, post a message
on the list notifying the members of the file's availability and mail
it only to those who show interest. Please do not post very large files
to the list without checking first to be sure that a majority of list
members want them. As another option, such files can be sent to me and
made available to list members in the same way that the list archives
are available. Disk space permitting, I am very open to this method of
file distribution.

6. Finally, remember that this list is moderated (by me). I don't
generally get involved in a heavy-handed way, but those who consistently
violate the basic rule of "be considerate" may receive warnings from
me, or even be removed from the list. I also reserve the right to
reject any posting which is clearly not appropriate. Such a rejection
will always result in a message to the list stating the action and
the reason for doing so.

Thanks for your cooperation and contributions to this list. If we 
all work together we can keep this list the valuable, informative
and useful tool that it is now.

Norm.

Subject: ADMIN: Administrative Requests

Just a reminder, folks: please send all requests for administrative
functions (changes of address, requests for removal or subscription,
requests for files or message archives, etc.) to the administrative
address of amigae-request@bkhouse.cts.com. Do not send them to me,
nor post them to the list at large.

I've been getting a lot of administrative requests sent to all sorts
of addresses. Sometimes I see them and do something about them, 
frequently, I do not. For both my sake and yours, please remember
to use the request address for such things. 

Thanks for your help with this.

Norm.

Subject: ADMIN: AmigaE list postings

After the move of my residence, and the move of bkhouse, the phone
company is having some problems getting the extra lines that I need, so
bkhouse is sharing a line. This means that postings turn around every
two hours, as before, but only from 11pm to 6am. This will be remedied
soon. Thanks for everyone's patience while I straighten this out.

BTW, for those who are curious, bkhouse is short for Bookhouse, as in
the Bookhouse Boys for those who may have been Twin Peaks fans (as I
was). :-)

Subject: FAQ? Very basic questions?

Hi.

I've only recently subscribed to this list, and have only recently
started playing with E.  I wanted to know if there is a list of
Frequently Asked Questions (and their answers, :) ), and/or if there
is anyone who doesn't mind answering *terribly* basic (I assume)
questions that aren't answered in the documention for E.

    What, PROGDIR: ?  That's a nifty little thing that works like an assign
to the directory the program was launched from. (OR the current dir from
Shell) That's what I'm using for now...until I decide to put in the above.
It works, lets me assign tooltypes, and get them. 

>I'll be releasing all the source code to Quip (with it's many wonderful, usefu
l

    I haven't yet decided wheter I'm going to release my source code yet.  I
may require people who want it to give me a phone call. (I figure everyone
can spend $1 to talk with the author, and find out all the little
idiosyncrosies (sp) before they go delving into it. I don't really want to
let the source out in Europe, cause there could be some mutation of it going
around and I'de never see it :-)   Oh well...

  Yeah...don't worry about it, I understand completely...I'm going back to
school in 10 days...so I'm in a BIG hurry to get the bulk of what I want
done.  So far, there haven't been any bugs found in the last version I sent
out (version 0.40 ) so hopefully, it will be the same with version 0.50 ! I
am just working on more functions through my editor.  Also, I want to get
some form of PREFS installed. I will be sure to send you one of the first
final, registered versions. Hopefully I can get everything ironed out by the
time Wouter is ready to release 2.5 (and I can get it included! :-)

  Wellllll, I just got it last nite! It took me 10 minutes to download
(820K!)...I will send the modules and EPP Pmodule for it out...BUT someone
needs to come up with an assembly function to do the work of the amiga.lib
DoMethod() or DoMethodA() calls. So they are useless until we get
something...(I spent an hour converting C code to find out I couldn't do
anything with it!)

Subject: Object Help!

Don't worry, After September 9th you guyz won't have to worry about helping
me! :-)
    I am now working on reading in 15 lines each with 5 different sections,
4 of which need to be stored in a global variable, and then NOT TOUCHED.  I
am using an object right now...I was using an ARRAY OF LONG but that didn't
seem to work.  What is happening is that the final line is being put into
where the previous lines information should be.  Here is what I have


OBJECT user_object
  usertext:LONG
  usertype:LONG
  usercomm:LONG
  usermisc:LONG
ENDOBJECT

  This is the object...I have fifteen (number of lines I need to read in)
global variables defined as user_pref1:user_object...user_pref15:user_object.


PROC getprefs()
DEF prefshandle,
    inline[80]:STRING
  IF (FileLength('ENV:EDS.cfg')=-1) THEN RETURN
  IF (prefshandle:=Open('ENV:EDS.cfg',OLDFILE))=NIL THEN RETURN
  WHILE ReadStr(prefshandle,inline)<>-1 
    IF (StrLen(inline)>1) THEN processprefs(inline)
  ENDWHILE
  Close(prefshandle)
ENDPROC

PROC processprefs(in)
  DEF bar1,
      bar2,
      bar3,
      bar4,
      gadnum,
      gadnumtmp[3]:STRING

  bar1:=InStr(in,'|',0)
  bar2:=InStr(in,'|',bar1+1)
  bar3:=InStr(in,'|',bar2+1)
  bar4:=InStr(in,'|',bar3+1)
  MidStr(gadnumtmp,in,0,bar1)
  gadnum:=Val(gadnumtmp,NIL)

  MidStr(gadtxt,in,bar1+1,bar2-bar1-1)
  MidStr(type,in,bar2+1,bar3-bar2-1)
  MidStr(command,in,bar3+1,bar4-bar3-1)
  MidStr(misc,in,bar4+1,ALL)
  IF gadnum=1
    user_pref1.usertext:=gadtxt
    user_pref1.usertype:=type
    user_pref1.usercomm:=command
    user_pref1.usermisc:=misc
  ENDIF
  IF gadnum=2
    user_pref2.usertext:=gadtxt
    user_pref2.usertype:=type
    user_pref2.usercomm:=command
    user_pref2.usermisc:=misc
  ENDIF
ENDPROC

  getprefs() is called at startup, before I open my window, where
user_object.usertext for all 15 lines goes into the gadget text of 15
different gadgets.  Then, when that gadget is selected, I am going to be
executing the command of TYPE DOS or AREXX with COMMAND whats being
executed, and MISC being the port for AREXX and ASL having an ASL requester
get a file to append to COMMAND for TYPE DOS, etc. 

  If you haven't guessed, this is for a config file (goes in ENV:) which for
now is only going to be edited with a seperate text editor.  Here are two
example lines from the cfg file:

001|NewShell|DOS|Newshell CON:10/16/620/257/CustomShell/CLOSE/SCREENEDS|#
002|Jump2End|REXX|(move {sf})|JED.2

  Also, if you are wondering, gadtxt...misc are being defined globally as
STRINGs as thats the only way I could get information out of the process at
all...HELP!

Subject: Re: E Guru! (icon routines)

Jeffrey J Peden ][ graciously types:

(source removed for bandwidth)

|    I thought that locks from workbench WERE NOT supposed to be released. 

That was what I thought, too, but I found that I couldn't delete the directory
afterwards (at leave, WB 2.04 doesn't seem to), so I started unlocking them
myself.  It doesn't crash or anything, so...

|    What, PROGDIR: ?  That's a nifty little thing that works like an assign
|to the directory the program was launched from. (OR the current dir from
|Shell) That's what I'm using for now...until I decide to put in the above.
|It works, lets me assign tooltypes, and get them. 

It wasn't good enough for me.. I wanted to read the tooltypes for icons that
were projects rather than tools (so my users could have different "preferences"
for different icons to run Quip from), and I found this to be the best way for
me to do that.

|    I haven't yet decided wheter I'm going to release my source code yet.  I
|may require people who want it to give me a phone call. (I figure everyone
|can spend $1 to talk with the author, and find out all the little
|idiosyncrosies (sp) before they go delving into it. I don't really want to
|let the source out in Europe, cause there could be some mutation of it going
|around and I'de never see it :-)   Oh well...

That's cool.. I've been wanting to get this project out, though, and I've done
a lot of work to get things working as well as possible, but perhaps someone
else might find a better way to do my routines, so I'm releasing the source
code.  Also, I really don't have enough time to keep up with it, so I am sorta
hoping that someone will pick up part of the project (particularly, I would
love it if someone would modify the code to handle compressed quips..
especially using IFF and XPK routines).  I'll eventually wind up doing it
myself, if nobody else does, but in the meantime, if someone is impatient for
some fixes or whatever, they'll be able to program it themselves.

I'm releasing Quip today to wuarchive.wustl.edu (I'll be deciding where in just
a little bit.. been having some problems uploading the archive to my VAX site
due to a lack of workspace <sigh>).  If everyone would like, I'll compress the
source code and release it uuencoded to this list.. although anyone with FTP
access will be able to get at the source code anyway, so perhaps this option
should be discouraged <chuckle>.  I source code comes to about 2000 lines,
including comments, and might have a few bugs in it (Quip's been tested fairly
carefully, but I still can't get the darned thing to handle external commands
that well.. don't know WHAT the problem can be).

For those who don't know what my Quip project is, it's simply a fortune cookie
program, however, it's a fortune cookie program from HELL.. it has more
features than any other fortune cookie program in existence.  It has so many
features, I decided to create a scripting 'language' for it (for more
flexibility).  My goal was to create a cookie program usable by anyone for
virtually any purpose.  You may have to go through some hoops, but Quip comes
close to delivering on its promise.  Most of what has been slowing me up lately
has been a desire to get the compression work in (which I finally decided to
give up on for this release, and is the reason why I uuencoded the XPK mods for
everyone earlier), and I wanted to re-write the documentation so people without
AmigaGuide could read the docs.

no, actually not. Those includes are generated automatically. I just told
stefan how to do it, and then he added it to his MUI system.

one simply needs a suitable domethod() for E:
 
 
MODULE 'intuition/classes', 'utility/hooks', 'intuition/classusr'
 
/* example call: domethod(myobj,[METHODID,...]) */
 
PROC domethod(obj:PTR TO object,msg:PTR TO msg)
  DEF h:PTR TO hook,o:PTR TO object,dispatcher
  IF obj
    o:=obj-SIZEOF object     /* instance data is to negative offset */
    h:=o.class
    dispatcher:=h.entry      /* get dispatcher from hook in iclass */
    MOVE.L h,A0
    MOVE.L msg,A1
    MOVE.L obj,A2            /* probably should use CallHookPkt, but the */
    MOVE.L dispatcher,A3     /*   original code (DoMethodA()) doesn't. */
    JSR (A3)                 /* call classDispatcher() */
    MOVE.L D0,o
    RETURN o
  ENDIF
ENDPROC NIL
 
 
this probably will be in modules also by v2.5, but for now it might help.
NOTE: I just hacked this together from a amiga.lib disassembly, and haven't
been able to test it yet, so just try it, and report any problems...
 
It's beyond me why commodore has put DoMethodA() in amiga.lib

Subject: Pointer to PROC??

Hello E'ers,

I'm having problems with system-function that need a pointer to a piece of
code (a procedure in the source code).

For example, AddTask(...) needs such a pointer. I tried backquoting the
Procedure's name but this hanged my Amiga.

What's the (right?!) way to do this?

hEllo,

As I would like to use the locale.library, I need 2.1 modules, so:

Are 2.1 modules available for AmigaE?
If not, what do I need to convert them from C headers?

Subject: pointer to PROC??

The way (or at least one way) to pass a pointer to an E PROC as a parameter
is to use the curley brakets, i.e. {myproc}. Be really sure that you understand
the procedure structure and register usage before you pass an E PROC's address
to an amiga library routine, especially if the referenced proc is executed
directly or indirectly and also especially if the proc (or any nested procs)
it calls references E global variables, i.e. those DEF'ed prior to the first
procedure. It may also of interest to you to know that the curley bracket
method can be used to pass the address of any piece of code, not just a
procedure. To do this just hang a label on the piece of code you wish to
reference and then pass its address to a library procedure by use of the
curley brakets, e.g.  libproc({mylabel})
in this case the program would contain a mylabel: statement somewhere (actually
anywhere) in the program.

 graphics.library/LoadRGB4                           graphics.library/LoadRGB4

   NAME
        LoadRGB4 -- Load RGB color values from table.

   SYNOPSIS
        LoadRGB4( vp, colors , count )
                 a0     a1     d0:16

        void LoadRGB4( struct ViewPort *, UWORD *, WORD);

   FUNCTION
        load the count words of the colormap from table starting at
        entry 0.

   INPUTS
        vp - pointer to ViewPort, whose colors you wish to change
        colors - pointer to table of RGB values set up as an array
                 of USHORTS
                        background--  0x0RGB
                        color1    --  0x0RGB
                        color2    --  0x0RGB
                         etc.         UWORD per value.
                The colors are interpreted as 15 = maximum intensity.
                                              0 = minimum intensity.
        count   = number of UWORDs in the table to load into the
          colormap starting at color 0(background) and proceeding
          to the next higher color number

   RESULTS
        The ViewPort should have a pointer to a valid ColorMap to store
        the colors in.
        Updates the hardware copperlist to reflect the new colors.
        Updates the intermediate copperlist with the new colors.

   BUGS

        NOTE: Under V36 and up, it is not safe to call this function
        from an interrupt, due to semaphore protection of graphics
        copper lists.

   SEE ALSO
        SetRGB4() GetRGB4() GetColorMap() graphics/view.h
--- cut ---

... and LoadRGB32 for AGA/OS3 purposes... Or maybe SetRGB4() would be better 
conserning fading. But examine the autodocs. ;) I have tried to do somekind 
of fading routine with AmigaE and it seems to fade, just that it crashes 
allways ... Well, if I get it working I can post it here...

|I just got QUIP!

Heh.. I've had it a while, but then, I wrote it so...

|I see what you mean, needing to add XPK support! Whoa! 10,000 lines!?

Yeah... mind you, I ripped most of that off other fortune cookie programs, and
there's a minor chance that some of them repeat <gasp>, but I've tried to take
repeating quips out.  I figured I'd better give a TON of quips to my potential
users instead of crippling them with only a few (and leaving them to gather the
rest).

|But, I have a proposition for you, to perhaps make Quip more used...use it
|to add taglines to messages. 

Actually, I was hoping (by releasing the source code) that others would be able
to do exactly that.  That's why I made it work with stdio (besides being plain
easier).. so people could redirect the output to the ends of messages or
something.  The prefix/suffix file support stuff could make customization that
much easier, too, by having the header of the message as the prefix, the
message itself as the 'format', the quip, then the BBS could add a tag-line as
a suffix!

However, I have been looking for a bunch of one-line quips to use for this
purpose (that is, I need to find a datafile filled with one-line quips, and
I've been too busy to manage this myself).  Perhaps your Gamma-Tags could be
reformatted to Quip conventions...

|You have almost everything there, but when the GUI is added, this may be
|something to think about. 

I was actually surprised that people wanted a GUI for Quip, but after thinking
about it a while, and knowing some of the problems I had with manipulating the
quips (it's a major pain, I think, to have to use a text editor to find the
quip I want to modify, when I know the number of the quip), I can see where a
GUI front end/maintenance program for Quip would make it a very positive
addition to the overall setup.

Here's a question for everyone who has bothered to look at Quip...

I want to make the damned datafile smaller (it's irritating, to me, to have a
textfile that is .5 megs in size, when I know text can be crunched and
extracted fairly quickly).  I've planned to use XPK to handle this.  XPK will
let me pack/unpack in memory rather than always using files (thank goodness).

My problem is, I want to create an IFF to handle this, but I don't want to
compromise on size (that is, I don't want to wind up using 8 bytes for every
single quip, yet I want to take advantage of IFF).

Currently, my thoughts are to put all the compressed quips in the same IFF
chunk (say, FORM QUIP DATA), then have another chunk with relative pointers to
the compressed quips within the chunk (FORM QUIP TABL), with perhaps other
chunks for other bits of information (FORM QUIP COMM MAXS XPKN...).  Does
anyone have any input on this; am I going about this efficiently.. is there a
way that might be more efficient for both speed and compression.. anything I
perhaps haven't taken into account?

In any event, I'm happy you like Quip, Politikill.  If you should create any
new datafiles, please send 'em up <grin>.

Subject: Scrolly Routine!

Hi all,

This program is a scroll routine which makes a horizontally
scrolling pattern. It could be used as the basis for a
horizontal shoot-'em-up.

How it works:

First, I set up a 784x200 low-res screen. This is more than
twice the width of a normal low-res screen, and is NTSC so
that all can use this example straight off.

There are 4 images, one blank and three differently coloured
images. The data are those hexadecimal numbers - stored one
bitplane at a time (two bitplanes). The images displayed in
the demo are decided at random, but it would be easy to get
the program to read this data from memory to produce a game.

Each VBL (vertical blank), one image is pasted just to the
right of the visible area and one just to the left. This
continues until that column is full of images. Pasting of the
next row then starts after 4 VBLs because the images are 16
pixels wide and the screen is only 12 blocks tall.

Each VBL the screen is shifted one pixel to the left using
the ScrollVPort() function. This does not move any graphics
data, it simply shifts the view that you have onto the
screen's bitmap.

When a full screen has been built up, there is already a
copy of the image because of the blocks that were pasted to
the left of the visible portion. This means the screen can
be flicked back and the whole process starts again.

The result is a very fast scroll routine, which is silky
smooth even under Intuition (!). The only CPU time used each
VBL is the time to paste one 16x16 image, making it feasible
to produce a game based on many bitplanes. The variable
SCROLLSPEED can be used to increase the speed of the scroll.
Set it to 1, 2, 4 or 8 for best effects. This also signifies
the number of 16x16 images drawn per VBL.

Although this example only works under KickStart 2.0+, it
could be modified for earlier OS versions.

Enjoy!

Dave.

I also want to be compatible woth Zmodem..
so, can anybody tell me what Zmodem does?
I've tried to find docs in the Zmodem.library archives, but I cant!

    Ahhhhh...yeah...when I sent out GammaTag with 1500 one-liners, I thought
that was a lot...I now have 2500 or so...when I see really good ones, I rip
em off too.

    Sure...if you want I can send you a message with all of them...I think
it would probably be shorter than UUEncoding them, but I'm not sure.

    Yes! Everything today HAS to have a GUI! Without it it's useless :-) 
When I wrote GammaTag, it came from this 10 line (not exaggerating) ARexx
script which picked a random number, and then added that line from a tagline
file...I modified it to use a GUI using RexxArpLib, and then went about
adding features galor! (favorite taglines, insert taglines where the text
{GammaTag} is, selection of another tagline...I went WAY overboard...I
wanted to convert it to E, but ran into problems with listviews...maybe when
I'm completely done with EDS...

    I don't think you can do this...you would have to creat your own
library...what you could do now is creat the IFF file with a header perhaps
letting Quip know the start and end of each quip, and then just plain raw
data after the header....I still think using a plain text file which is
automatically XPK'd where the person can go in and snag ANY quip they want
without having to use Quip at all...they would just have to manually unpack
it.

    Actually, it's WiZkId...my address is just Politikill...and ACTUALLY, I
had to delete Quip from the HD...I got Syndicate (AWESOME, AWESOME GAME!)
and Brilliance (kinda) this weekend...

Hello All,
 
here's a MUI example I hacked together in E. It seems to work,
though it isn't that nice yet, since I did not make any
functions to make up for the macros MUI normally uses. also
you'll need the domethod() source (posted earlier) and the
mui.e that comes with MUI to get this running.
 
Have fun,
 
Wouter

  So here's the problem. I am a new Amiga programmer and have only just 
started looking at E. My first project is a small drawing program like
a hugely scaled down DPaint. Everything was going well until it came to
the Flood function in the graphice library. 

  From what I understand. In order to use the flood function you must
first initialize a temporary raster with 3 things:

    1> A pointer to the current raster port. (I've done this)
   
    2> A pointer to a buffer area. (I've almost donbe this)

    3> A pointer to a temporary raster port. (Not a clue)

  The first thing I've done. As for the second and third things; how do
you know what size buffer you will need? And, how do you create a temp
raster buffer? 

  I appologize if anyone is offended because these are not Amiga E
specific questions.

   without requiring a return to signal end of input as required by Inp() and
   other functions that get charactes from stdin.

   The trick here is to get a pointer to an open window so we can change it's
   IDCMP flags to get VANILLAKEY messages from intuition.  Then we just do what
   we will with the VANILLAKEYs, change the windows IDCMP flags back to the way
   they were and return whatever info we've accumulated (in this case a string.)

   To extract the scan routine and use it in your progs without modification you
   will need cursorOn(), cursorOff(), and scan(), and all the modules in the
   MODULE directive as a minimum.

hEllo pEople,

Looks like I missed something: doMethod() source? Can someone send me the
source of this, as I would like to use this with MUI.

Furthermore, what's the latest release of AmigaE? I'm using 2.1b at this
moment, and I would like to know if there's an new (commercial?) version
(coming up?).

Don't I wish, Norm.  Actually, I've been occasionally carrying on behind the 
scenes and whining to a few (who I suspect might continue to put up with it) 
about being overworked, underpaid, and unappreciated.  Little time to code E. 
 :'(  <*sniff*>

But when I get the chance (tonight? <*drool drool*>) all the E code in my 8-bit,
caffeine-charged, ceiling-fan-cooled, dynamic-capacity cache will be straining 
the limits of my 10-pin/12-cps, anti-tangle, chemo-kinetic data bus in a logic-
defying attempt to astound the E community!  Ha-ha-haaah-HA-HA-HAAAH!!! }8-D
I shan't say more (you're welcome!)

Subject: Pointer to PROC with AddTask??

Hello fellows!

I nEEd somE hEEElp hErE...

I'm having troubles converting a C source, that demonstrates the starting of
and communication between the maintask and a daughtertask (which is started
from the maintask). The C source is on aminet misc/amag/Amiga_9309b.lha and
called 'Multitask/task.c'.

The problem comes with 'AddTask', which needs a pointer to the daughtertask.
I now know that {procname} is the address of the procedure in AmigaE, but
I can't get the AmigaE version working (it crashes).

Does someone know how to add a PROCedure as a new task in AmigaE??
I cut out some source from the C source.

This is the daughtertask procedure:
-----
void __saveds __interrupt TochterTask(void) {
  StopTochterTaskSig=AllocSignal(-1L);
  Signal( MainTask, 1L<<TochterStartedSig );
  while( (SetSignal(0L,0L) &
                    (1L<<StopTochterTaskSig)) == 0)
    TochterCounter++;
  FreeSignal( StopTochterTaskSig );
  Signal( MainTask, 1L<<TochterStartedSig );
  Wait(0);
}
-----
Line of the maintask, which starts the daughtertask:
-----
AddTask(Tochter,(APTR)TochterTask,0L);
-----

	I've been doing a little C programming on the VAX here (for classes),
and I noticed a set of somethings I wish we had for use with Amiga BBSes...
namely, 'curses.h'.

	How difficult is it to use Amiga E for creating libraries?  That is,
run-time shared libraries (eg. xemvt340.library or icon.library).  I think it
would be an excellent idea to create a termcap.library, designed to handle
various routines to manipulate the screen in a manner similar to the VAX's
'curses' routines.

	This way, multi-lined BBSes can have people with different kinds of
terminals (Amiga, IBM, Mac, VT220, VT340, plain, etc) take advantage of the
same programs, without having those programs depend on a certain ANSI setting. 

	For example, the programmer wants to create a BBS.  When the user first
connects, he wants to find out what kind of terminal he's dealing with, so he
opens termcap.library, and tells it "What do I ask this joker?" and it comes
back with a string to send out.  You send out the string, and a string comes
back.. that string is sent to the library, which then determines the
appropriate termcap entry (if any).

	Then, the program stores the termcap entry somewhere for future
reference.  Later, the user tries to open a full-screen editor.  The editor is
told which termcap entry, so it opens termcap.library, and asks for the various
codes and whatnot for such and so.

	BUT.. it can get even better...

	Perhaps the termcap.library can hold images of what the screen should
look like to the user, and other images of what the screen can look like in the
future!  Then, if you need a screen refresh, you have an image to send.. but if
you need to open text windows, text doesn't get destroyed, it just gets
occluded (but can be retrieved by calls to close the window).. basically, sort
of a set of textual-windows for stream i/o!  Perhaps a bunch of other nifties
like this.  The possibilities are exciting.

	Still.. the programming would be the bear.  Can Amiga E be used to
create runtime shared libraries?  If so, how?  Is this project idea even worth
pursuing in the future?  Would BBS game/door authors even bother to try to use
it?

Hi!  I just joined this mailing list after considerable soul searching
(I told myself that I'd never again write code that would run on only
one machine.  But after looking at E, and after failing to spend any
time doing any C++ coding for the Amiga, I decided to break down and
have a little fun) I was wondering if there is any particular place to
find any E source.  Heck, anything done in E would be interesting.

Any special ftp sites or just keep looking around on Aminet sites?

Thanks,

Brad.

Subject: Mail or a lack of

I have been getting very little mail from the Amiga E forum?
Is it there has been little traffic or I just not getting all of the mail.
BTW is there a diffrence between "amigae@bkhouse.cts.com" and 'amigaE@bkhouse.com.cts'
BTW when is a new version of E coming out?  I have 2.1b.

aha, (drool drool) E-coding.. (drool).
I need more!

This IDCMP thing is driving me nuts!
I can't get the loop to work!
 REPEAT
    IF idcmpMessage:=GetMsg(win.userport)
      idcmpClass:=idcmpMessage.class
      SELECT idcmpClass
        CASE IDCMP_VANILLAKEY
          idcmpCode:=idcmpMessage.code
          idcmpQualifier:=idcmpMessage.qualifier
          ReplyMsg(idcmpMessage)
          doKey()
        /*...any other cases you need to handle...*/
      ENDSELECT
    ENDIF
    IF serialEvent() THEN doSerial()
  UNTIL someTerminalCondition /*end program, or end function*/
Well, WHAT should idcmpMessage be a pointer to?
arch!

Subject: Video Timing

Is there a better way to "wait" than using the WaitTOF() function.  It is too
much of a time gap.  I'd rather use CIA-Timing, but I don't know how...  anyone
care to enlighten me?  Thanx in advance...

Subject: passing screen data

When I open a window on a public screen.  How do I get the number of bit
planes used by the screen.  I am working on a drawing program that works in
a window on the workbench screen and conforms to the current graphics mode.

Ok, I have another question...  I am reading lines from a text file line by
line using a REPEAT...  UNTIL eof and ReadStr(), it's really slow!  Is there a
better way?  I have looked at a few people's code and some use Read().  What's
that do?

Subject: Fixed text strings


I'm trying to figure out how to write a fortune type of program,
that has (for the first version anyway) 16 or so fixed sayings built
in to the exe (no extrnal textfiles this time around).  What's the
most efficient and robust way?
I thought that for so few items that I should use
SELECT randomnumber
  CASE randomnumber=1
    TextF("First fortune")
  CASE randomnumber=2
    TextF("Second fortune")
etc.

or would it be more memory efficient/faster to toy around with
pointers?  And have the texts as dc.b's (or the e equivalent thereof)

Have fun
Alan

Subject: Re:  File Handling

read() quickly loads a file into an allocated memory area, a buffer

once you've got the file in this buffer, you can quickly access it, and
EG, copy chars into a string until you reach a <RETURN> char.
this seems complicated and messy, but it's MUCH faster than readStr()

if you need more help, just say the word...

Subject: A little E program


  Dear All,
   
  I've written a little program which someone else on this planet may find
useful.  It's not very pretty but (I think) it works.  Basically, it's for
people who have a version of TeX, like me, which doesn't decide what format
file to use from the command name it is invoked with (like the Unix version
does).  For example, if you make a hard link to 'virtex' called 'latex' the
'lplain' format file will be used.  Frustrated I set about making my TeX
do the same. 
  The program can be run from Workbench or the CLI (and it does different
things...).  If run from the Workbench by itself it will invoke an interactive
session of TeX, LaTeX or any other kind of TeX you have by looking at the
name of the Workbench file.  The command names TeX and LaTeX get translated
to format files 'plain' and 'lplain' respectively, any other name is taken to
be the format name.
  If run with arguments from the CLI or Workbench, it will investigate each
file's icon (if it exists) for a 'DOTEXFMT' tooltype. This can be 'LATEX',
'TEX', or a format file name (like 'sliplain' or 'plain').  Otherwise it
looks through the first 20 lines to find a line which begins '\documentstyle'
or a comment '% latex' or '% tex'.  These decide the format used.  Failing
all this normal TeX is run (the 'plain' format).
  I use this program in conjunction with ToolManager (2.1) to have only one
icon on the dock which does LaTeX or TeX according to the file.  You can also
use it as the default tool for a TeX/LaTeX file.
  Notice the use of the ReadArgs template 'FILE/M' to get standard arguments
(like C's argv stuff) for the CLI, and the SystemTagList function to spawn
asynchronous tasks.  Also, I've used StringF which Wouter omitted from the
2.1b documentation!

   Let me know if you tidy it up or fix it!

Subject: Bug report (Don't panic, Wouter :)

The bug's mine, and I'm surprised no one's called me on it yet.  A little
while back I posted a small example of how to use idcmp to get keyboard input
and build a string out of it.  Well, one of the things I meant to do in the
scan() function is to save the old idcmp flags of the window argument so they
could be restored upon exit.  The example worked without apparent side effects
since the window I used had no idcmp flags set, but in real life it will act 
unexpectedly if the window is using idcmp outside of the function.  To fix the
problem, just change the line in scan() that reads

  oldIdcmpFlags:=win.flags

to read

  oldIdcmpFlags:=win.idcmpflags

My apologies.

I think (from an expansion point of view) that the best way is
to simply use a texfile containing all the fortunes..
but, if you don't want to do that, I suppose the SELECT way is simplest..
and easy to expand, but with (I've heard of these) thousands of lines,
it's not THAT memory efficient...

Well it's not a "fortune" program per se,
it's a "Magic 8 Ball" program, you know like the toy with the window
in the bottom, that tells you yes, no, maybe, not clear at this time,
etc.  So a huge number of sayings isn't needed.


Now today's question:
How do you make an "ordered dithering fade-in" routine?
I know it involves using an 8x8 table but I'm not sure what you
actually DO with it...

Have fun
Alan

Actually, here's a spot where E really shines...

You need to use an E specific feature, called 'Lists'.  This will be the
best way to do what you want to do, and doesn't require any kludges.

For instance:

  TextF(ListItem(['First fortune','Second fortune'],randomnumber))

Just fill in the square brackets with the fortunes you want to use, and
that single E statement does the equivalent of the SELECT statement you
started to use...  :-)

(Oh, yeah... remember that E likes single quotes around strings, double
quotes around characters.  Backwards from most other languages, but...)

Hi 
    I am finally done with EDS. It will be released to the masses (you) by
this weekend.  I would really like to get rid of a few small bugs, and test
it on a wider base of machines, but I just ran into a dead-end alleyway. I
just got my phone bill for the last month, and it is not good news. I need
lotsa money quick! So, I am asking everyone on the mailing list here to take
a good hard look at it, and sincerely consider registering. I am going to
release it for $15, which will get you a registered version, without the 15
second wait on saving. An additional $5 will get you the source, although
that does have some restrictions. Any problems reported to me from this
version will be corrected ASAP, but there is only one machine that EDS has
been tested on that gives unsatisfactory results, and they have not been
replicated on any other machine. 

Here is a short list of the features of EDS:

  7 Edit, Revise, Comment, Pre-Process, and Compile all from one interface
  7 User Style Guide Compliant
  7 GadTools interface
  7 OS 2.x/3.x Only (Yes, this _IS_ a feature)
  7 User configurable buttons
  7 Interface to JED text editor
  7 Send ARexx commands to any port
  7 Low Price
  7 Source Available
  7 Written in E for E!
  7 Customized to suit you
  7 AmigaGuide Documentation

  Right now, I only support JED, but you can support CED through the
customizable buttons.  In future versions, I may let you define certain
scripts for the editor buttons and completely define the 15 user buttons.
All this will be in version 2.0 (40.1).  I will go through any means
possible to help those who register (up to a point). 

  I believe EDS is useful for everyone who is programming in E, and has at
least WB 2.0.  (If you don't, then you really SHOULD upgrade) I really need
as many people to register, because I would really like to stay on this
list, but unfortunately, I have to call from Massachuesettes to California
to get Internet access! (I wish the phone company would be taken over by the
government!)  So, if you can, please help a 15 year-old High School student
(who can't find a job 'cause the 30 year olds take all the student jobs) who
did the only thing he knew how to do on his summer vacation and now has to
have something to show for it.

Subject: Problem with {procname} and AddTask


Hello fellows!

I nEEd somE hEEElp hErE...

I'm having troubles converting a C source, that demonstrates the starting of
and communication between the maintask and a daughtertask (which is started
from the maintask). The C source is on aminet misc/amag/Amiga_9309b.lha and
called 'Multitask/task.c'.

The problem comes with 'AddTask', which needs a pointer to the daughtertask.
I now know that {procname} is the address of the procedure in AmigaE, but
I can't get the AmigaE version working (it crashes).

Does someone know how to add a PROCedure as a new task in AmigaE??
I cut out some source from the C source.

This is the daughtertask procedure:
-----
void __saveds __interrupt TochterTask(void) {
  StopTochterTaskSig=AllocSignal(-1L);
  Signal( MainTask, 1L<<TochterStartedSig );
  while( (SetSignal(0L,0L) &
                    (1L<<StopTochterTaskSig)) == 0)
    TochterCounter++;
  FreeSignal( StopTochterTaskSig );
  Signal( MainTask, 1L<<TochterStartedSig );
  Wait(0);
}
-----
Line of the maintask, which starts the daughtertask:
-----
AddTask(Tochter,(APTR)TochterTask,0L);
-----

Subject: Amiga E Newbie

Hi All,

 Just a couple a general questions from a newbie.

 I dl'd Amiga E a couple of weeks ago and as of yet haven't
had time to do any thing with it other than compile the
helloworld.e example to see if everything was set up right.
I've also read the docs on the compiler and some of the reference
doc.

My question is how does Amiga E stack up to other langs. like C and
Basic in terms of learning curve, ease of use, etc., etc.
I have a good working knowledge of C (but little programming) and
have done a lot of programming in basic. Hopefully I will be doing
a lot of programming in E.

This is my first time joining a mailing-list. I like the idea of
having a place to go if I have questions or problems as I am
kind of isolated from other amiga programmers.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Problem with {Procname} and AddTask

You showed us the C source which worked (except for the declaration of
the task) and based on what you have said I assume that it works. You
said that your E code didn't wrok correctly. I suggest that you do two
things, 1. be more specific about how your code fails (or doesn't work) and
2. post a code fragment showing how you called AddTask, including  the
definition for the item passed as the first parameter (the task) and the
code you used to initialize the required fields of the task structure AND
the code you used to allocate the stack for the added task. BTW, please
remember that E code assumes that a4 and a5 are set appropriatly. If you
are not using any global items (those defined prior to the first PROC) then
you need not worry about a4 unless you reference any of the E-provided
"procedures" such as CleanUp, WriteF, etc.. But E does assume that any
parameters/local variables are addressed via a5.

Subject: Various stuff...

Well all,
  I'm back from Germany and working away on some programs.  I had a few 
things to say/ask:

   a)  WHERE IS EVERYONE?  You're studying too hard!  Take a break!
   b)  Norm:  You keeping an ftp'able archive of the list?  If so, where?
   c)  While I was working in Germany, we all had a discussion about
        who was working on what.  How's it going with everyone's
        projects?
   d) I'll assume almost everyone is using EPP (thanks, Barry!).  That
        being true, wouldn't it be a good idea to have a central FTP
        site for everyone's PMODULES so we could all benefit from each
        other's routines?  (Think about it:  A set of libraries for
        fancy 3d graphics routines, a set for sound, a set for device
        access, text manipulation, windowing/boopsi/intuition, etc.)
  e)  In fact, we should establish a central FTP site for source.  I only
        say this because I have no idea how hard it would be to get an E
        directory under aminet/dev/source.

Where I am:  Well, I'm currently working on SDM.  Now up to 0.3a.
  SDM stands for Sparse Distributed Memory.  basically a holographic
  storage system.  The version I'm working on now will learn to read
  text...anything.  Books, newspapers, term papers, you name it.  I
  have most of the routines either coded or planned, at least as far
  as having it correctly recognize concepts, categories, and predict
  word sequences (I'm using pop science texts, but will move on to fiction
  soon).
    Once I have thatt done, I'll implement the other half of SDM, which
  will add content-addressible associative memory to it.  In other words,
  give it a word or phrase, and it can free-associate in a human manner.
  After that's working, I may just make it talk just to round things out.
  Throw in a few emotions, and you may have an Amiga striking up a conver-
  sation with you in the future (but, that would require voice-recognition,
  and I havent looked at the soource for VCLI all that closely.)  Either
  way, you amy could have feelings, and express them to you in natual
  language (at least, that's whatt I'm hoping.  all this is based on a
  theory of SDM developed by Pennti Kanerva, and was designed as a memory
  system for a fully autonomous rrobot...it was never designed with text
  in mind, although it works just fine with it.  (remind me to slow down
  my key repeat rate.))

So.  That's where my projects are so far.  All the others I listed (except
  the TIERRA port) will be using SDM as the foundation for their functioning.
  I get this thing working, everything else is pretty much downhill.

What progress has everyone else made?

-mark

P.S. - No, I'm NOT kidding.  It works (at least what I've already implemented).
     I do this sort of thing on a regular basis (it's my field of study).

Subject: Re: Problem with {procname} and AddTask


  I've tried to do similar things --- like using SetFunction.  I gave up in
the end (it didn't really need to do such a horrible thing!).  But a point to
remember is that variables are PC relative (I believe).  So I think you may 
need to do:
   MOVE.W A0, {procname}
   LEA A0(PC), A1
or some such to get the real address of the procedure.  I could, of course, be
talking rubbish, but no-one else has replied to either of your messages so I
thought this might be useful.

  Whilst we on sticky subjects: how can you duplicate a file-handle, or open
two handles on a CON: window?  I ask this because SystemTagList closes both
its input and output handles if run Asynchronously, and I'd like to give it
input and output on the same window!  (See my DoTeX posting to see where I
want to use this function.)  Anyone got any bright ideas? At present I only
supply a valid output handle, which means you can't iteract with the spawned
processes.

  Thanks!

Subject: Transputern


Hello, just a quick question here... Anyone involved n transputers, except
BaryyW?  I am looking at the moment for a means to hang transputer
networks off the Ami, short of designing a who;e new Z board!

Stioll thinking...

BTW (lots of typos) because I am logged on from der Klinikum, Aachen
(Germany) 400 metres from Holland! And Daimler Benz have just demonstarted
a 300TD Merc called OScar which has a autonomous driving control system based
on transputers (19 t800 = <200mips!) And it has been driving on Germanys
Autobahns at up to 140 kmh (No custom harward.. Hardware, apart from tranaputer
Frame grabbers! It does automatic lane-changing, roadsign recognition and tracking
and other stuff. My eyes are still rolling!!!

Speak again next week!

Subject: How Does E Stack Against Other Languages

This message is in references to THORNTONJ@iccgcc.cs.hh.ab.com's question:

|how does Amiga E stack up to other langs. like C and
|Basic in terms of learning curve, ease of use, etc., etc. 

I figured out how to program in E within about a couple of months.  For me, the
biggest trick was getting used to the polymorphic nature of the variables.. I
kept passing the wrong variables around, guruing my computer <chuckle>.

E's strongest feature, in my opinion, is its handling of lists.  I really LOVE
that.  The polymorphic variable bit is very good, too.  However, I still like
C++'s object oriented nature.. I LOATHE global variables, and find myself
having to do some funky weirdnesses to work around global variables in E, where
I have less trouble in C++.  Further, I don't much care for E's handling of
objects.. that is, you cannot have objects within objects without having to
reference a separate variable.. eg:

OBJECT fulubreath
 smile:INT;
 grin:INT;
 laugh:INT;
 make_others_suffer:fulubreath
ENDOBJECT

DEF goo:fulubreath, gah:fulubreath

/* you cannot....*/

goo.make_others_suffer.laugh

/* you must instead */

gah:=goo.make_others_suffer

gah.laugh


I find this to be rather annoying.. but given E's advances, I'm willing to put
up with it.  One other annoying thing is the lack of a modular approach to
programming in E.. that is, you may not create separate *.e files and merge
them together into one.  While EPP sort of addresses this issue, I've
experienced some minor problems with EPP (although, to be honest, overall, I
like the way EPP handles things better than most compilors).

However, E is FAST.  I LOVE that... I generally don't have to wait for
half-an-eternity for my files to compile.  And it creates VERY compact code,
with built-in stacks (so your users needn't worry about THAT nonsense), and
several other nifties.  It uses the Amiga's potential better than any other
language I've seen to date.. my compaints above are mere quibblings compared to
the advantages of using E for the Amiga.

So.. if you want portability, and Object Oriented features, C++ is still my
favorite.  But if you want something that'll make really EXCELLENT code for
your Amiga, E is the language for it.  I'm very much looking forward to E's
update, as I suspect the issues I've raised are already being worked on.  E's
portability will probably always be a problem, though.. but I don't really
care.  I don't much like MS-DOS or MacIntosh anyway.. I'd rather program for my
Amiga.

Subject: Random numbers

Okay people, I have a problem.

  I'm tryring to generate random numbers.  Here's the story:
Using code that Barry supplied, I have a 2D matrix, 500x70, set up.  I
want to go through each cell in the matrix and randomly put a value
between -40 and 40.  When I say RANDOMLY, I mean: A uniform random sample
from the set [-40..40].  Here's what I tried (in psuedocode):

	FOR x:=0 TO 499
	  FOR y:=0 TO 69   /* Remember, Barry:  this is psuedocode... :)  */
	   c:=Rnd(80)
	   c:=c-40
	   array[x,y]:=c
	  ENDFOR
	ENDFOR

Again, in psudocode, here's how I read it back out:

	FOR x:=0 to 499
	  FOR y:=0 to 69
	   IF array[x,y]<0 THEN WriteF('0') ELSE WriteF('1')
	  ENDFOR
	ENDFOR

This should print out lines of length 70, containing a random sample from
the boolean set [0,1]^70.  However, All I get are vectors containing all '1's.
What gives?

Does anyone have a code solution for this, or some mathematics for a more
statistically-pure uniform random sampling procedure?  This is gonna drive
me up the wall!

To make things worse, I wrote a little program called test.e.  Here it is:

PROC main()
  DEF a,x
   For x:=0 to 10000
     a:=Rnd(1000)
	IF a<500 THEN WriteF('0') ELSE WriteF('1')
  ENDFOR
ENDPROC

Works just fine!!! I don't get it.  Barry, could this be a problem with how
your array routines store integers (positive versus negative?)  I'm confused.

hopefully,
mark

Sorry if any of you have got this before, but the mailer-daemon threw it
up.

(REPOST)

I'm writing a program that has variable length variables. How do you allow
them to grow as needed?

Also, can you make E output object files? (like to make libraries with)

Subject: Oops...

  Sorry folks.  Just solved my own problem.  It DID seem to be a problem with
how the array was storing those negative integers...instead of storing them
with a minus sign, it simply rolled backwards from 0 to 65536 and decremented
from there.  I just hope that that roll-over works both ways (i.e., increment
past 65536 and get back to 0), otherwise I'm going to have about 35,000
very confusing counters running...

  Anyone care to comment on the roll-over?  (Barry?  Hmm?)

If you have prior experience with other languages the transition to E should be
rather easy.  I began coding after one evening of reading the docs and some of 
the easier examples.

>biggest trick was getting used to the polymorphic nature of the variables.. I
>kept passing the wrong variables around, guruing my computer <chuckle>.

Programming in E does require a more rudimentary knowledge of the computer, but
once I got used to E's loose typing I found that I liked it ALOT!  I've always
been an advocate of string typing, but E makes loose typing powerful AND 
elegant.  E had proven to me that a well designed language can dispense with 
all  that extra strong-typing baggage and not detract from productivity and 
reliability.  Contrary to popular claims of strong-typing advocates, I'm coding
projects faster in E than in any other language I've tried so far.  

GURUs:  when you try to use the more powerful features of any programming 
language your gonna crash the machine.  I've crashed my Amiga more often using 
C++ than with E (and I've had to wait 300 to 500 times longer to compile, link, 
and crash my computer in C++! :-)  I've even crashed my machine using 
AmigaBASIC, imagine that!

>E's strongest feature, in my opinion, is its handling of lists.  I really LOVE
>that.  The polymorphic variable bit is very good, too.  However, I still like

Lists, a unique and VERY powerful feature.  And they will get better in the 
next release!

>C++'s object oriented nature.. I LOATHE global variables, and find myself

Hm, what do you have to do?

?

>
>gah.laugh

This is a recurring complaint, something for which I've found a suitable
solution.  So here it is again:

  PROC laughFrom (b : PTR TO fulubreath) RETURN b.laugh

to use it:

  react(laughFrom(goo.make_others_suffer))

If you do this frequently in your code, it's smoother and more readable than 
dereferencing by multiple assignments.

>I find this to be rather annoying.. but given E's advances, I'm willing to put

Yes, E is advancing and we shouldn't have to put up with it forever. :)

This WILL go away with the next release.  E v2.5 will support modules, and in
a much better way then EPP.

I believe the proper expression is "E is FA-A-A-A-A-A-A-AST!!!" :-)  It is a 
major fault of E that when I used C++ I always had an opportunity to go get a 
sandwich or take a leak.  EC doesn't give me the chance to step away!  Oh well, 
not all languages/compilers are perfect :-/  (joke, you may laugh :-)

>half-an-eternity for my files to compile.  And it creates VERY compact code,

Yes, indeedy!  I'd also like to add that E is far more reliable than any other
language I've used on the Amiga.  My C++ compiler came with some broken and/or
missing functions! And that thing cost me $225 at the time.  I'm still pissed
about that 3 years later!  And I was told that if I wanted to upgrade my 
compiler I would need to buy a *complete* C package to replace the outdated one
supplied with C++ (already 2 major versions behind!),  another $150-$200!  
Which brings up two more issues.  Even if Wouter charges "a lot" for v2.5 it 
will still be much more affordable than other commercial products, and if you 
have access to this mailing list (and you've proven that you do) then you 
already have better support than most other Amiga programmers, including those
who buy expensive C++ compilers from well-known corporations. :-)

>language I've seen to date.. my compaints above are mere quibblings compared to

I agree.  Devote a small amount of time to learning E and you won't be able to
escape the attraction, AH-HAAH-HAAH! B-D

E will soon rival C++ objects!  And try to do exceptions in C++, Aaargh! :)

I'd like to temper my reactions here somewhat.

I do like C++.  It's a pretty cool language, but it has some serious problems. 
Those problems are being addressed, but at a very slow rate (because 10 billion
comittees must agree on the proposed changes, and there are politics involved.)
And some of those changes won't be improvements IMHO.  E is improving rapidly, 
and I haven't seen one proposed change that I dislike, not one.

And please don't take anything I said here personally, Trey.  I wanted to reply
to the original message and didn't I have the time.  But yours popped up in my
mailbox today and gave me some good points to focus on, and since I now have
the time...

Yes, Mark, I've encountered this same phenomenon in C, too.  The roll-over 
works both ways.  It's a hardware thang.

I'm one of those people who bought a certain well-known C++ compilor from a
certain well-known company for a certain well-known price of $300 (at the
time), who noticed that the company was also well-known for not documenting its
work properly, having absolutely shitty header files (files that would not
reference types.h, but use stuff within it.. etc.) and yet decided to start
charging $$$ for technical support.  Even following their illogically laid-out
book, there are problems you cannot work out with that particular compilor. 
Just say NO...

And, as you said, charging an additional $n00 for a bleeding *C* compilor is
nothing short of highway robbery.  I have plenty of complaints against that
company.  I wish I could get my money back from them <sigh>.  The only reason I
didn't go to the GNU C++ compilor was because of hard-drive size.. I can't
afford to give up 10 megs just to a compilor!

Which is yet another "nice thing" about E... you don't have huge header-files
filling up your hard-drive.  Since it's binary, it's compact.  VERY nice.

I had noticed perhaps one little documentation error in E.. something I easily
verified for myself and changed (I think I included the change in the
amigaguide-formatted file I sent out.. not sure).  It had something to do with
the MidStr function, but I don't remember what it was.

Considering the billions of mistakes I found in the C++'s manual, this was a
very minor problem.  Heck, if Commodore can make mistakes in their Includes and
Autodocs, I'm sure Wouter can make a mistake in his E manual <grin>.  Wouter's
manual was logically laid out (although it takes a little bit to catch on to
the logic, if you have never taken a structured programming language course,
such as myself <sigh>), and covered most of the bases.

RE: various problems I cited with E (currently), and my expectations that
they'll be solved with the next release

| This WILL go away with the next release.  E v2.5 will support modules, and in

I am eagerly awaiting this.

BTW: thank you for the PROC suggestion for handling struct.struct.struct
problems.  That'll be yet another way of handling it.. and it looks fairly
elegant.

RE: My comment that I loathe global variables, and I have to do strange things
to work around it with E, due to lack of OOP features

| Hm, what do you have to do?

I either have to pass a bunch of pointers, create an object whose pointer I'd
have to pass, or do very cumbersome case statements (I think Wouter made a
comment once about a very nasty-looking case statement I had... he suggested I
consider using more PROCs, but I didn't feel like creating the case-statement I
would have had to make).

You should see it.. it is almost a work of horror-art... I have a case
statement that extends for several pages, and one of the cases extends for
about two pages.. all because I wanted to avoid using global variables.  I'm
almost phobic about it.  I *am thinking about making a huge object to pass
instead, just to make life a little easier for the poor slob who might decide
to read the code sometime (not to mention forcing me to handle things
differently.. perhaps in a better way).

I'm trying to imagine anyone even bothering to PROGRAM in AmigaBASIC <shudder>.

Just out of curiosity, have you ever had your C++ compilor (I've noticed that
we've both tried to avoid naming the company who sells it) guru DURING the
compilation of the code?  I'm not talking about the code guruing when you try
to run it.. I'm talking about the compilor itself guruing.  This happened to be
consistently while I was teaching myself C++ on that particular compilor.

E never did that to me.  It would compile my code, and then I could find the
little bombs I created within my own code.  I'd have to say, though, that I've
bombed my Amiga more with E than C++.. only because I've done more serious
programming with E than C++ (I gave up on the C++ compilor early in the game,
when I saw how concerned the company was for its customers).

I will grant this as an acolade higher than I can assign to any other writer of
programming languages, and that is, simply, that Wouter van [name incredibly
too long for me to remember well] supports E EXTREMELY well.

I've sent him E-mail a few times with various what-not regarding E (before I
found this list), and he's always responded with candor and diligence.  I was
concerned that I might be hindering his programming of the update, so I asked
if there might be a forum wherein I could babble various questions, and he
mentioned this list to me.  He was even POLITE!

Let me emphasize this...

He was p-o-l-i-t-e!

I once thought I found an error in his compilor, and, as any dutiful user-of-
programs should do, I decided to inform him of this bug.  It turned out that
the bug was something on *my part, not the compilor's part, but he didn't rant
and rave or anything.. he thanked me for my concern, and nicely asked for more
information (it was in the search for more information that I finally figured
out that *I* was the cause of the bug, not *he*).

In contrast, I've dealt with other programmers who were very rude to me at the
mention of a possible bug in their programs (even if one existed).  It was
almost as if I had slandered them on international television, saying something
like "And [such-and-so programmer] prefers sex with aardvarks over other
humans."  Really weird.  As a result, I am usually somewhat timid about
mentioning bugs to programmers.

This message is entirely too long, and doesn't really say all that much, but I
hope it's helpful to SOMEONE out there.  If you're still considering whether or
not to program in E, just give it a small try.  Even a simple 'Hello World'
program... then try another compilor (*borrow* [don't keep] that C++ compilor
from a friend, please don't make the mistake Barry and I made, and actually PAY
for such a piece of trash), and notice the difference.

I feel certain you'll prefer E.

Subject: dev/e on aminet!!!!!

 
 
Hello everybody!
 
I hereby announce that on aminet a directory called 'dev/e' is
being created! here we can up and download any stuff that has to
do with E. for a start, the directory should contain:
 
- all E related programs from 'dev/lang'
- all Norm's list archives
- utilities and compiler updates from me (Wouter)
 
  and, most important:
 
- utilities and sources from all you E programmers out there!
 
 
so, start uploading all your utilities (also non-E utilities
that have a source in E), and sources/docs there! Urban Mueller
(the moderator of Aminet who so kindly created the dir), asks
us two things:
 
- the .readme should contain 'dev/e'
- the directory should not 'catch dust', but I don't think
  this'll be a problem if we all support it.
 
 
we know have a central place to gather all E related material,
and I think this is of benefit to us all, certainly to those
who have been searching for a place to find more E sources.
Also on this list we'll be able to refer to the aminet if
we want to distribute large sources instead of mailing them.
Norm probably will make available the contents of the
directory also by mail for those who don't have FTP access.
 
support it and enjoy it!

Yes, EPP's source is like that, 10 million parameters for each function call.
The last versions were a compromise, but still use too many parameters.  I 
have yet to find a nice even balance between global/local vars.  I've tried
both routes, maybe my next project will be a step in the right direction.

Yes, he's a very supportive programmer.  And a nice guy, too.

        PROBEMS WITH THE TRIG FUNCTIONS IN MATHTRANS.LIBRARY

I have a problem.  I need, given an angle and the distance to move at that
angle, to know the delta_x and delta_y so that I can move an object to the
new location.  To do this I am using the MathFFP and MathTrans libraries.

If my old math notes are correct, the way to do this is with the following
two equations:

            delta_x = cos( angle in radians ) * radius
            delta_y = sin( angle in radians ) * radius

My first problem is that my angle is in degrees, so I need to convert it to
radians.  To do this (again with the help of my old math notes), I believe
the eauation is:

                            pi
                radians = ------ * degrees
                           180

Converting this all to E, I get:

    PROC newXY( degrees, radius )

      DEF delta_x,
          delta_y

      delta_x = SpFix( SpMul( SpCos( SpMul( SpDiv( 3.14159265, 180.0 ),
                              SpFlt( degrees ))), SpFlt( radius )))
      delta_y = SpFix( SpMul( SpSin( SpMul( SpDiv( 3.14159265, 180.0 ),
                              SpFlt( degrees ))), SpFlt( radius )))

      pos_x:= pos_x + delta_x
      pos_y:= pos_y + delta_y

    ENDPROC

Now for the problem, this does not work.  The numbers that I get do not come
out right (not even close).  What am I doing wrong.  Can anyone help me or
possible give me a routine that will do the same thing?

NOTE:  I am loading the library correclty and pos_x and pos_y are defined
as globals in the beginning of the program.

Thank you in advance.

Subject: Read-only gadget problems

Hi folks.
  I'm elbow-deep in implementing the GUI for the holographic memory system
I described earlier, and I've run into a wall.  I'm trying to use the
read-only display gadgets available in 2.0 (TEXT_KIND, RKRM:Libs p.397) for
the display of status messages and the like.
  However, to display any text in these gadgets after initializing them, the
OS requires that you use Gt_SetGadAttrsA(), and provide it with a pointer to:
  the gadget (no problem)
  the window its in (no prob)
  NIL (no prob)
  a taglist of the attributes to change (no prob...sorta)

  Everything's fine, except for the taglist.  Because TEXT_KIND requires a
pointer to a string containing the text to display.  E doesn;t like someone
declaring pointers to strings.  Well, I set up an OBJECT with an array of chars
(right out of the E manual), and then set a pointer to this in a def statement.
Set this var to contain the string, pop it in the Gt_Set...A() function,
and.......nothing.

  Could someone post a short example of:
     Setting up/creating an empty TEXT_KIND gadget,
     then, successfully displaying a string in it using Gt_Set...A().

Much appreciated,
mark

P.S. - Perhaps we should declare ourselves 'experts' in some certain aspect
  of E or programming in general, so those with questions can get good 
  answers, and those with knowledge can supply them.  I'll go first:
  No expertise as such in E, but anyone needing any answers concerning
  matrix manipulations, nonlinear systems, neural nets, artificial intelligence
  artificial life, cognitive psychology, expert systems, prolog, lisp, 
  parallel processing, etc. (these things may come in handy as general
  algorithmic helps), I'm yer guy.

P.P.S. - I also do cutlefish.  ;)

Subject: GTSL_DISPFUNC & E PROC ?

Hi all,

I'm having probs with a slidergadget and it's GTSL_DISPFUNC tagitem. This
tagitem is meant to add a function to the slider that calculates the level
to be displayed near to the slider.

For example, it may be needed to use the slider to select a screen depth,
while the levelvalue is the number of colours, here 2^level.

The problem is that I can't attach a function (a PROC) to this tag properly,
as the system crashes when I move the slider (and the system wants to call
my function calculate the according value to be displayed.

I attach the function as follows:

GTSL_DISPFUNC,{calculatelevel}

but I have no idea how the function should read the arguments it gets, (I
believe a window pointer and a gadgetpointer, but I'm not sure as I don't
carry my RKRM'S with me all the time :o)

Can anyone give an example of how this must be done?

ok test the simple algorithm made by D. Lehmer
a[0] = seed;
  for ( i =1 ; i < N ; i++)
   a[i] = (a[i-1]*b+1) % m;
the result will be an integer between 0 and m-1.
Pay attention for values of seed,b and m : m must by power of 10 or 2,
b will be one digit less than m. Third rule b must end with x21, 
x must be even!! this is important.

It seems like there are some uncertainties about how to call E
procedures from other places (like tasks). The problems with this is
that lots of E code is dependant on a global environment, which demands
pretty tricky code to restore. that's why with v2.5 there'll probably
be modules for tasks, hooks etc.
 
>> For example, it may be needed to use the slider to select a screen depth,

with a function like this we can do it the easy way, since computing
2^level doesn't require an environment.

sure, how about:
 
  IF (g:=CreateGadgetA(SLIDER_KIND,g,
    [offx+150,offy+61,315,27,'slider:   ',tattr,2,0,visual,0]:newgadget,

     GTSL_MAX,5,
     GTSL_LEVEL,2,
     GTSL_MAXLEVELLEN,2,
     GTSL_LEVELFORMAT,'\d[2]',
     GTSL_DISPFUNC,{depth2colours},
     NIL]))=NIL THEN RETURN NOGADGET
 
 
and:
 
PROC depth2colours(level,gad:PTR TO gadget) RETURN Shl(1,level)
