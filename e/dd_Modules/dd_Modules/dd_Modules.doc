NAME

  dd_modules -- e class implementation sources

AUTHOR

REQUIREMENTS

  AmigaE 3.2a or better.

DESCRIPTION

  This is a part of some e class implementations that I have in
  development for use in my (future) programs. These are the ones
  that actually are functioning.

BACKGROUND

  These sources are released to be shared amongst E programmers and
  to help develop a public pool with e classes that can be used as
  building blocks for applications. Motivation for release was the
  Amiga E Object Oriented Project (OOEP).

  However, all was written before the OOEP existed; sources do not
  comply with any rules that are or will be decided in order to get
  ourselves a nice uniform collection of useful modules.

NOTES

   Programming OO classes is one thing, getting them to work together
   is another. I'm fairly new in OOP, and especially interaction
   between objects, and notification is an issue I haven't found a
   solution for. (i.e. the application steers the object through
   methods, but how will a object talk back?)

   Some classes are overprotected for programmer fools; it is filled
   with pointer NIL checks and destructor related stuff. In a more
   definite version, I throw these out, and assume everyone calls
   a class destructor instead of doing CleanUp() or similars.
