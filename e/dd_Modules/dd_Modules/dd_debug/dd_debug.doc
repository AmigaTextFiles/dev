dd_blackboxes/dd_debugon

NAME

  dd_debugon.m -- module for serial debugging
  dd_debugoff.m -- module for serial debugging

AUTHOR

REQUIREMENTS

  Requires that the PREPROCESS option is enabled. Needs the tools/debug.m
  module by Lionel Vintenat for the serial debugging functions.

DESCRIPTION

  The dd_debug modules implement serial debugging by using macros. The
  macros serve as a kind of conditional compilation guards. By using
  the dd_debugon module, all debug macros are compiled along in the
  program executable. By using dd_debugoff, they are simply ignored,
  as if they were never there.

FEATURES

  Simple way of enabling or disabling serial debugging. Debugging can be
  controlled for each module each in a large project.

MACROS

  KPUTSTR(string)
  KPUTFMT(string,datastream)
  KPUTCHAR(character)
  KGETCHAR
  KRESET

TODO

  Implement the other debug functions as well. Use a new approach that
  can not be implemented now because a macro cannot insert a comment.
