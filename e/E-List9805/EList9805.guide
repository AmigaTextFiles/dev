@node ID0_0 "Why?!? (ID0_0)"

From: agraham@hal9000.net.au (Ali Graham)
Date: Fri, 01 May 1998 23:47:17 +0930
Subject: Why?!?

In one project I'm (re)writing at the moment, a module of mine
will always crash at one particular point. It doesn't matter what
method is called at this point, it always crashes as soon as it
is called (i.e. WriteF() as the first line of the method won't
get to show up).

I've used Enforcer, MungWall, Wipeout, PatchWork, SegTracker, EFindHit
and Sashimi, and worked that absolutely nothing bad is going on
until this 'crisis point' is reached... I'm reluctantly beginning
to think that I'm doing something that the compiler doesn't like,
and it hasn't organised the method dispatcher for that object
properly.

Is it legal to have two different objects with similarly-named
members within the same module? e.g.

OBJECT test_one

    test

ENDOBJECT

OBJECT test_two

    test

ENDOBJECT

I've got some like this, and haven't had a problem before... but
the module is about 14K compiled by now, so maybe that's large enough
for these sort of problems to be creeping in.

I can't EDBG this program, as it uses patches into the OS (and other
programs crash if these don't return promptly; I also think EC DEBUG
probably does some funny stuff to the patch code...) but I have verified,
both with 'WriteF()-style' debugging and with EFindHit exactly where the
problematic point in my source is.

Has anybody else come up against something like this? Is there anything
else I could be looking for, or any other debug tools that could help
me here? (setup - '030 with MMU)

Not that I think this will help, but here are the Enforcer hits and the
guru presented when I attempt to call the method....

On Fri, 1 May 1998, we received a letter from  about 'Why?!?':

Of course, no problem there.  See how many objects have embedded lh
structures
in them as one.

EFindHit will need debug hunks as one to work.

One thing to watch with patches: stack usage.  A system patch means your
code
will be running on the caller's context, so try to avoid putting too much
stuff
on the stack - allocate memory for them as needed.

Watch out too for trashed registers.

>  LONG-READ from 00000018                        PC: 103891FA

Such a hit usualy mean you have an un-initialized structure, and you tried
to
access a pointer (or any other LONG) at offset 18.  Look for any object or
OS
structure that you could be accessing an item at this offset.

One hint for those system patches: use kprintf() from amigalib/debug.m.
This
will allow getting some output even if your caller is a task.

Speaking of this, make sure your patch code doesn't do any DOS calls unless
you
KNOW it's safe, since a calling task cannot access DOS.  An example is
Delay()
which will die when called on a Task context.

That's about all I can do, not knowing at all what code and exactly when
your
problems are happening.

DEBUG mode pads the code with some NOPs, that EDBG will turn into ILLEGALs,
so
it can run code as normal, and recieve 'illegal instruction' traps after
every

- - Have you used debug/kprintf to print out the values of all the
  variables/dereferences you make? This is by far the safest way, and if you
  go overboard you can write every executed line of your source code again
  with the values it is using again.

- - Remember you can't use anything that throws exceptions out of the patch
  procedure, always use HANDLE on your patch procedure, best not to use
  any exception-handling (directly or indirectly, eg NewR()) at all.

- - Remember that not only are patches called from an entirely different
context
  than the normal E code. A different process cannot use your stdin/stdout.

- - Remember tasks can also call system functions, and they cannot call
  dos.library at _all_. Therefore, _you_ may not call dos.library unless you
  check process.task.ln.type = NT_PROCESS. Better still, avoid dos like the
  plague, and instead use exec messages to communicate to another running
  process you set up to do the dos IO.

- - Remember that any patch you write will _increase_ the stack usage of all
  programs which call that function. Don't DEF complete structures or
estrings
  or lists/arrays, always use pointers to allocated memory. (Or if you were
  patching, say, AllocMem(), use semaphore-protected global space.)

- - Remember that any one time, more than one task can be calling the same
  function (concurrency). If you use global structures, protect them with a
  semaphore.

- - Some functions are marked as safe to be called from interrupts - in this
  case, you have to handle the possible deadlock that may occur (interrupt
  blocks task, then goes into a loop that waits for the blocked task to
  finish, which it will never do.)

- - Remember that trashing A4/A5 is fatal to E (save these registers if you
  touch them).

- - You must supply _all_ the correct registers to the patched function.
Load
  them explicitly with inline assembler. Do _not_ rely on E leaving those
  registers alone.

- - Remember to save _all_ registers as part of your assembler stub before
you
  call the E function itself. Never patch E functions directly in place.

- - Always allocate new MEMF_PUBLIC memory for each patch you make. Don't
free
  this memory until you are _sure_ noone is calling the patch.

- - Also ensure that you don't trash registers by calling the replaced
function
  like this:

        original := SetFunction( ..  {blahpatch} .. )

        [in blapatch():]
        original()

  E does not tell you, but it actually does this:
        MOVE.L  original, A1
        JSR     (A1)

  obviously, if one of your parameters was A1, you've just lost it.
  instead, do it yourself with inline asm:

        MOVE.L  original, A3
        JSR     (A3)

  or, if A0 to A3 are tied up as function parameters (like
EasyRequestArgs()),
  save A4 and recycle that:

        MOVE.L  A4, -(SP)
        MOVE.L  original, A4
        JSR     (A4)
        MOVE.L  (SP)+, A4

  don't use A5 for this purpose, if A0 to A4 are in use, then patch the
address
  directly into a JSR $xxxxxxxx. Remember to flush the caches before anyone
can
  call this.

- - Remember to check the OS function's autodocs for defined side effects
that
  you must.

- - A good debugging tip is to write a small assembler program to make an
example
  call to the patched function. You can then use an assembler monitor (such
as
  the spanky one in the new ASM-Pro, or trusty old Monam2 - this will show
you
  exactly what your E code is up to.

- - Take a look at Aminet:util/boot/MemPatch.lha
  I wrote the patch.m module included with it, sadly I didn't have time to
  write some autodocs for it, but MemPatch itself should serve as an example
of
  usage.

  The only unimplemented thing in is that I do not check if 'enough' stack
  space is left in the calling task's context before calling the E function.

Oh yeah, one of the things that kept crashing MemPatch until I noticed that
I
loaded the A4 register like so:

        MOVE.L  $xxxxxxxx, A4   ; $xxxxxxxx = globvec

  when of course it should be

        LEA.L   $xxxxxxxx, A4

Can anyone spot the problem in this code?

(The only example I was able to find of the use of ReadPixelArray8()
was in the ADoom source; and the code I replicate here seems to be
fundamentally identical to the use of it in there.)

BTW, OS 2.x users, don't worry; I'll wrap the AllocBitMap() stuff
with appropriate checks/alternatives, I just need to get a working
routine here :)

PROC convert(image:PTR TO image) OF chunky_image

    DEF bitmap:PTR TO bitmap, rastport:PTR TO rastport,
        temp_bitmap:PTR TO bitmap, temp_rastport:PTR TO rastport

        self.data:=3DNew((SIZEOF_CHAR * 4) + (image.width * image.height)=

        -> ignore this; necessary for the converted data in my usage of i=
t.

        self.data[0]:=3DShr(image.width, 8)
        self.data[1]:=3Dimage.width AND $FF
        self.data[2]:=3DShr(image.height, 8)
        self.data[3]:=3Dimage.height AND $FF

h, BMF_STANDARD OR BMF_CLEAR, NIL)
        temp_bitmap :=3D AllocBitMap(image.width, 1, self.depth, BMF_STAN=
DARD OR BMF_CLEAR, NIL)

        InitRastPort(rastport); rastport.bitmap:=3Dbitmap

        CopyMem(rastport, temp_rastport, SIZEOF rastport)
        temp_rastport.bitmap:=3Dtemp_bitmap; temp_rastport.layer:=3DNIL

        DrawImage(rastport, image, 0, 0)

        -> self.data is a PTR TO CHAR, and the + 4 is to leave space for =
the size
        -> as set above.

        ReadPixelArray8(rastport, 0, 0, (image.width - 1), (image.height =
- - 1),
                        self.data + (SIZEOF_CHAR * 4), temp_rastport)

        FreeBitMap(bitmap)
        FreeBitMap(temp_bitmap)

        END rastport, temp_rastport

    ENDIF

ENDPROC

I did have working code that does this in the place of most of that (i.e.=

keep up to and including DrawImage(), and then have this:

        FOR y:=3D0 TO (image.height-1)

            FOR x:=3D0 TO (image.width-1)

                self.data[((SIZEOF_CHAR * 4) + (image.width * y) + x)]:=3D=
ReadPixel(rastport, x, y)

            ENDFOR

        ENDFOR

but it was way too slow for large-ish images (e.g. 40x40 - 1600 calls to =
ReadPixel() can't
be an optimum use of resources :).

First some hints:
  - no need to allocate the rastport structure dynamical, create them
    on stack (temp_rastport:rastport) and initialize it
  - always check if AllocBitMap() could allocate the bitmap

Now to your problem. All ReadPixelXXX-functions need chunkybuffers that
are a mutliply of 16pixels width! You haven't described what exactly
fails but
if the function produces graphical garbage then this is probably
the reason.
Because of this nasty size restriction I always use ReadPixelLine8() and
copy every line into the destination bitmap:

Note:- allocBitMap(), safeGetBitMapAttr(), freeBitMap() are procs that
also
        work on pre v39

Thank you! It is now working fine; I may adapt both this and the remappin=

Recently I found a C source which I wanted to convert to E. But
I'm not really sure what this means:

  c^=b
  c^=*b++
  c=a^b

I believe this translates to this:

  c:=Eor(c,b)
  c:=Eor(c,b[]++)
  c:=Eor(a,b)

BTW does anyone have any good example source code in E for TCP.
If so, where can I find it?!

The STRING type is de-allocated at the end of the PROC it is defined in,
because it is a local variable.  be wary of that...  Unfortunately, you did
this in main(), so that probably isn't the problem.

Something to try:
NEW obj
obj.proc(str)

and see if that makes a difference (it shouldn't, but hey, you never know).

Also, try using String(), eg:

DEF str:PTR TO CHAR
str := String(100)
StCopy(str, 'blahdyblah")
NEW obj.proc(str)

CP>  a string in quotes, for example...

CP>    NEW obj.proc('Blah blah blah')

This would be typical of the first problem I mentioned.  Try using String()

I would do so:

PROC main()
    DEF mystr:PTR TO CHAR -> Just allocate the pointer

    mystr:=String(20) -> Now allocate a twenty chars long string.

    StrCopy(mystr,'Blah blah blah') -> Copies the string in mystr

    NEW obj.proc(mystr) -> the address of the string is passed to proc.

You might need to download the "detatch" package from AmiNet.

The problem with CreateProc is that when your program exits, it de-allocates
all of your code, so your Process just crashes.  I am not sure how detatch()
works, but it works fine for me, except from the Workbench, where it crashed
a
few times.

Did you try it?  I might work anyway...

Otherwise, try to contact the author of detatch, and find out how he did it.
I can't really help you with the details.

First, thanks to those who answered my help request for ReadArgs :)

Now I need some EasyGUI help...
*First:* I want to remove the RESIZE gadget in the right bottom corner, H=
ow?
I have read about WTYPE_NOSIZE but could not get it to work..
*Second:* How do I stop EasyGUI from removing LFs and ANSI codes in the
window output?   Also how do I specify a chars/line limit on the windows
and set a NONPROP font?

Here's how I done it so far:

easyguiA('FastDiz v0.2 - =A9 1998 Harry Samwel',
          [EQROWS,
             [TEXT,path,'File:',FALSE,3],

Use the tag list (the last [optional] arg to easyguiA()):

  easyguiA('Window Title',                 -> Title
           [BUTTON,0,'OK!'],               -> GUI
           [EG_WTYPE, WTYPE_NOSIZE, NIL])  -> Tag list

> *Second:* How do I stop EasyGUI from removing LFs and ANSI codes in

EasyGUI does not "remove" these things, it's just that ordinary windows
do not understand these special codes.  Control codes (like LF, CR) and
ANSI control sequences are special things that are understood by console
windows (like your Shell/CLI).

> Also how do I specify a chars/line limit on the windows and set a
> NONPROP font?

If you want to have a large expanse of text (rather than simple labels)
then you probably want some kind of dedicated PLUGIN.  It sounds a lot
like you want a text-editor PLUGIN, but maybe without the ability to
edit the text(!).  I wrote a text_plugin that allowed you to specify the
font (including non-proportional), but I'm pretty sure that's been
updated.  Ali Graham has compiled a big collection of PLUGINs (called
"EasyPLUGINs") that's available from Aminet (dev/e).

Cheers!

From: Allister@t-online.de (Allister Crowley)

Hi!

Does anyone of you know the Textinput MUI Custom Class?
It can be found at ftp.vapor.com (/pub/misc).

I would really like to use this custom class in one of my programs.
But since I do not know very much about the C++ syntax I did not
managed to convert the Include file to an AmigaE Module.

That's why my question:

Does anyone know where I can get an AmigaE Module that makes me able
to use this custom class and if there isn't any could someone convert
the Include for me?

I've converted the .h to a .m file. If you want it, I'll send it to
you... Anyway, if you program is to be freeware, I recommend the
Texteditor.mcc (for which I've converted the .h file).

Not quite. The amount added or subtracted depends on what b points to. For
an ordinary LONG (PTR TO CHAR) the above is the case. With PTR TO INT you
get b:=b+2 & b:=b-2, and for PTR TO LONG it is 4.

Read comp.graphics.algorithms FAQ. I recommend
"http://www.exaflop.org/docs/cgafaq/" as it is a nice

I mailed hime some time ago, and he was patient enough to answer me
:) I guess he's fed up with such questions...

He told me that he had some ideas on how to make EC generate PPC
code, but that this was going to be a lot of work (aprox. a year), so
guess...

OTOH, what should EC do ? Generated code for H&P WarpUp or for P5's
ppc.library ?

PPC would imply a big change in EC, and I think that Wouter has some
other priorities....

These modules are compiled just like they would be if you wrote any program
that
used these includes, so I don't see a problem <grin>

Hmm... that's something Wouter and I discussed a while back.  I seem to
remember that his opinion was that it wasn't distributing the C or
Assembly headers (in any reproducible way) so it was probably alright.
Plus, other people had done it for their compilers (like that free
version of Pascal) and Commodore (who we're still in charge at the time)
didn't get upset.

I had big worries about this when I embarked on the pain-staking job of
adding type information to the E modules, but I saw it as an extension
of the existing modules...  The fact that it took me bloody ages and it
had to be done by hand ought to grant me a little sympathy if they
suddenly do start getting upset.

I did mention the Commodore-Amiga copyright in the readme for the typed
modules, but I'm not sure what Wouter did with that when he incorporated
them into the main distribution.

I guess we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  Possibly the
changes won't be too big, and it may be fairly easy to incorporate such
changes to the existing modules, rather than starting from scratch
again.

As Charles has mentioned, we may have something more concrete to think
about after this weekend and the "big" announcement...  Let's hope it's
something good.

Cheers!

Do not read from memory everytime, try to load it into an variable.

    FOR lop:=start-1 TO end-1
       alop:=a[lop]

       IF alop<clop

Or try to precalc all fadeing tables and then just LoadRGB them.

That's what I was going to suggest, although you could just as easily
have added the functions to your own module, seeing as the setXXX()
functions simply wrap calls to Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA() and findgadget()
(as you can tell from the source to EasyGUI).

I'm hoping that you guys are going to band together and help Ali
Graham with his idea of a community version of EasyGUI.  Ali's
organised the EasyPLUGINs collection so I expect he'd be a good chap
to have organising the development of EasyGUI.  What else is there

I don't know that the first few versions would be all that "organised"...
as witness the initial releases of EasyPLUGINs :) Still, you have to start
somewhere, and (although I've been a bit short of time recently -
EasyGUIplus
is still just a wishlist and a barely modified EasyGUI.e) as long as I can
get
something together and put it out soon, that should engender some support
for
the cause, even if it isn't all that impressive to start with.

Uni will probably get hectic around the start of June, so I might try and
get something out the door before then...

Hi everyone!

I've heared that it's very hard to put an image in an
Gadtools gadget - but I really want to do so since Gadtools
is the GUI I use...

1.  Is there no single way to insert an image to a gadtools gadget?

2. EasyGUI... is that just a simplified Gadtools... thing? or is it
    a gui of it's own?

3.  If you have a workbench window active when you
     launch my program, how can you get a Lock() of that
    *window* to access the files in it, without having to select
    a file?

    Is it possible??

Thanx   :)

You can use the 'button.gadget' - examples are in the EasyGUI archive,
but you don't necessarily need to use EasyGUI to use that as well.

DL> 2. EasyGUI... is that just a simplified Gadtools... thing? or is it

Pretty much a simplified Gadtools (have a look at the source and I
don't think you'll say it's 'just' a simplified Gadtools :) I guess
you mean as opposed to MUI and ClassAct here (even these are different -
ClassAct uses BOOPSI while I think MUI works outside of that, using
its own OO system, notificatiom, etc.)

If your program is started from the Workbench, check out the section
on 'wbarg' in the E Beginners' Guide.... (You should be able to lock
the directory you started in and get a list of the files that way,
using various dos.library functions). If it's started from the CLI,
the procedure is much the same, but I think you'd use the CurrentDir()
call or something.... haven't really looked into it, sorry :)

Okay... That part I've understood already. But if you have a

  You can do this by creating a a generic gadget (GENERIC_KIND), & then
modifying a few of the gadget's fields.  It's a little extra work, but no=
t
especially hard to do.  Here's a code fragment (gad is a PTR TO gadget):

  gad:=3DCreateGadgetA(GENERIC_KIND, gad, gtng, NIL)

  gad.activation:=3DGACT_RELVERIFY

On the window itself, I don't think you can. I think you actually have to
select the drawer/device icon from which the window opens before running
the program, and then your program can get it from the args.

Hello

Maybe Mr Ali Graham could help me with a simple?! problem I have
with his multitext plugin?

I use the multitext plugin for my File_ID.DIZ viewer..
I want to have the standard window font on everything else BUT the
actual ID.DIZ, where I want to use a NONPROP font..  topaz 8 or 11
depending on screen resolution.  topaz 11 if vertical resolution is
equal to or greater than 400 pixels.

My question is, how do I set the font for just multitext?
And how do I set maxlength of chars/row ???
Is there some way to strip or view ANSI codes???

This is how I have written upto now:

list:=3Dstringsinfile(fulldiz,EstrLen(fulldiz),countstrings(fulldiz,
EstrLen(fulldiz)))

NEW multitext.multitext([PLA_MultiText_Text,list,
PLA_MultiText_Justification,PLV_MultiText_JustifyLeft,TAG_DONE])

On 16-May-98, someone (I think it was Harry Samwel) might have written:

HS> My question is, how do I set the font for just multitext?

Open the diskfont.library, then use OpenDiskFont() to get
a PTR to the font that you want to use. Then use this tag:

    PLA_MultiText_Font,    font,

in the constructor.

(Use CloseFont() after the PLUGIN's been ENDed, of course :)

HS> And how do I set maxlength of chars/row ???

You'd have to trim/test the length before using it, I guess;
maybe I could put something like this into the next version.

Maybe two new tags _MaxChars, and _MaxPixelWidth?

HS> Is there some way to strip or view ANSI codes???

Suggest to me how to implement this and I will; I'm not
even sure how the ANSI codes are represented in plaintext :)

Subject: LockIBase()

How do you use the LockIBase() function.

I'm trying to make my Gadtools GUI to open on the frontmost
screen. And when the program starts I get the intuitionbase.activescreen
value and then it gets correct.

But if I later want to read the activescreen again - I get the Workbench
screen... And then my OPUS screen is in front...

2
Is there a way to get the Pubscreen name of the current screen
without having to do like this: ( it's really bad...)

        ibase:=intuitionbase
        tscreen:=ibase.activescreen
        b:=String(70)
        a:=SetDefaultPubScreen(tscreen)
        GetDefaultPubScreen(b)
        SetDefaultPubScreen(a)
        WriteF('\s\n', b)

Awful huh.... But I don't know how to do it!!

Please help!

This is part of some code I use in a screendimmer prog; works for me

- -> insert your modules, global defs etc here
DEF scr=3DNIL:PTR TO screen

PROC get_screen()
DEF ilock=3DNIL, ibase=3DNIL:PTR TO intuitionbase
   ilock:=3DLockIBase(0)

AFAIK you have to do the above get_screen() every time you want a new scr=
een
pointer
from ibase.firstscreen

Maybe through the PubScreenList? Like:
Compare tscreen with a some screenpointer within the PublicScreenNodes. I=
f
it's equal get the name from PubScreenNode.name  or some field like this =
(or
maybe this is just gibberish; just pointing in a direction).

From: gamboni@fastnet.ch (Jacques Gamboni)
Subject: Fpow() bug?

There seem to be a problem with the Fpow() function.
The documentation says that Fpow(a,b) is equal to a^b, i.e. a raised to
power b.
But I used it and it seems to behave exactely the other way round:
Fpow(a,b) seems to return b^a, i.e. b raised to power a. So I wrote

#define fpow(a,b) Fpow(b,a)

and replaced every Fpow() by fpow() in my program (that seems to work ok
with that now), but is it really a bug of EC or did I badly understand
the documentation?
I did not yet try dPow() of longreal.m, to see if it happens also like
this.

Well, my reference guide for E v3.3a says that x:=Fpow(y,z) means x:=z^y.

However, I recall reporting a similar problem with the documentation to

The latest. But I was looking in the beginners guide (By Jason Hulance),
that
I think to be a little older.There it is written that Fpow(a,b) is a raised
to the power of b.

Oh dear, this is my fault, I think.  Fpow() is documented correctly in
(surprise, surprise) the E.guide, but not in my Beginner's Guide.  I'd
just like to add, as an attempt at some kind of defence, that the
arguments are a flipping silly way round, Wouter...  (I guess it has
something to do with the fact that the IEEE library function has the
same order of arguments, though.)

PathPart returns a pointer to the last ":" or "/" of the filename.
You can do the following (someone correct me if this is not ok :):

StrCopy(path,filename,PathPart(filename)-filename)

Where filename contains your string filename and path is the
destination string.

This tells the compiler that it can generate jumps in the compiled
code larger than 32k.  You should turn it "on" when the compiler
complains abaut it :)

Enables exception handling in this proc. Take a look at E.guide for

When your executable gets to 32k in size the compiler will moan that
references are outside the 32k range, then put OPT LARGE in your code
so that references are now outside 32k. OPT LARGE does a load of
internal stuff that no-one has yet adequatly(sp?) explained.

> PROC main() HANDLE  (I know what PROC main() is, what is HANDLE for?)
>

These are for exceptions:

PROC main() HANDLE -> tell this proc to handle exceptions.
        WriteF(`This line gets executed.\n`)
        Raise("NO") -> Raise an exceotion.
        WriteF(`This line never gets executed!\n`)

EXCEPT -> This is the exception handler.

        /* When you call Throw() The code comes here, the value of
        your exception is held in a special variable called `exception`
        you can do a simple SELECT..CASE..ENDSELECT to test which error
        it is: */

        SELECT
        CASE "NO" ; WriteF(`An exception occured, of the NO type.\n`)
        CASE "MEM" ; WriteF(`An MEM exception occured\n`)
        CASE "NIL" ; WriteF(`uninitialised pointer is being used.`)
        ENDSELECT

        /* It is useful to put your clean up code here, to deallocate
        mem, windows, etc... but we would need to change EXCEPT to
        EXCEPT DO, as if there was no exception raised the code would
        end at EXCEPT, and none of the code below EXCEPT would be
        executed. */
ENDPROC

You aren`t limited to using the special constants "????", you can use
normal constants, variables, and even strings, eg:

Raise(`An error occured`)
EXCEPT
WriteF(`error:\s\n`, exception)

It can get more complicated than that, as every PROC can have an
exception handler, and you can parse errors at different levels of your
code, and the ReThrow() it back up to higher code...

Also theres the exceptioninfo variable which you can also send along
with the exception, the exception info can contain whatever you want,
eg/ a filehandler that needs freeing, the window which caused the
error, the line number, an error description etc...

Exceptions are one of the very best things about AmigaE, and they`re
the reason I use AmigaE.

Hope this is helpful.

Andrew Hutchins.

Subject: Minor inheritance question

Hi, list

    Just a small problem that's come up...
    Suppose I have module first.m, with this object

EXPORT OBJECT first OF plugin PRIVATE
  width
  height
  some_other_thing
ENDOBJECT

    Now suppose I wish to create a new module, second.m, with:

EXPORT OBJECT second OF first PRIVATE
  depth
  time
  some_new_thing
ENDOBJECT

    You can see the problem I'm up against:  because 'first' is PRIVATE,
I'm unable to use, e.g., second.width from within second.m.  My only
choices are:
    a) making 'first' PUBLIC and go without data-hiding, or
    2) putting 'first' and 'second' in the same module (and I haven't
tested this yet, but the Beginner's Guide seems to think so), making for
a larger module.

Are there any other ways to get around this?  I'd like to keep
everything private and separate, but I'm guessing the second option is
the way I'll have to go...

This is better. Try to keep everything as separate as possible. You
could access the needed values from "first" through methods, like
set/get_depth.

It's only my opinion. I'm writing a program that outputs some
graphical data, so OO is the best way to handle it. Datahiding,
inheritance and OO in general is very cool :)

    This wouldn't solve the problem fully.  Some methods of the second
class are using SUPER to access the methods of the first class, and
they're fine.  But some methods have to be overridden, and there's too
much data from the first one that I need.

>It's only my opinion. I'm writing a program that outputs some
>graphical data, so OO is the best way to handle it. Datahiding,
>inheritance and OO in general is very cool :)

    Since I'm dealing with EasyGUI plugins, which are already OO, that's
the way I have to do it.  I've gotten around my problem for the moment
by putting both classes in the same module, so that I could test the
code. This only found another problem: having a method and an element of
the object with the same name... :)

    Another possible solution I came up with was instead of building my
classes as:     plugin<--first<--second

                                first
I could go:     plugin<--base<-<
                                second

and put the common elements in 'base' instead.

Hi There,

I'm wondering a few simple questions about E gui and that lot,

*1.* How do I Nort check datatypes before the program loads with the dt_pic

even though it has not loaded up ? This is *really* in pratical, 4 what I
have planed. :(

*2.* How Do I inclued files as part of the code ? I kow that .m files are
used, but I would like evey thing to be ing the code, (the main compiled exe
!) and how would I use them ?

*3. *How do I do *BOLD* text with EasyGUI

*4.* This New, NewGUI thing looks nice but - It only has German Docs, and is
it more, or with VisualPrefs (Gui Ehancer) the edge of the background comes

Ask Ali Graham, he will know :)

If you want to include data, then use an INCBIN ie/

eg/

data:
INCBIN `a:file/from/a/disk/or/something.data`

The data can now be accesed with {data} eg/

DEF n:PTR TO LONG

n:={data}
WriteF(n:\d\n`, n[10]) -> print out the 10th entry

Your INCBIN`d file needs to be in a HEX form, which can be real
irritating, as the data needs to be held as four CHAR values:

eg/
`00000000` is one LONG value (four CHARS) which if you look at the file
in an editor will look like:

`....` (notice that it`s four! Not eight!)

The 00 value is a CHAR, ie/ it`s a value between 0...255, (Its the same
as the ASCII codes, and is the value used to store them) It looks more
intelligent written in HEX, as it goes from 0...FF,

I`m getting myself in a bit of a muddle trying to explain this, but
hopefully you`ll get some of it, you can then go on to do even stranger
things, by defining n:PTR TO object, and making sure you hold all your
data at the right size and stuff (you could also use PTR TO CHAR, and
each n[]++ would be up one char)

There`s a more convenient method of including data, such that eg/

data:
LONG 12000, 1002, 12203, 1002, 1112

Which, if you did :

DEF n:PTR TO LONG

n:={data}
WriteF(`n:\n`n[3]) -> will print 12203

To include modules into the code you need to cut and paste the actual
module (sorry if I`m getting patronising, but your question implys you
want to do this). You can`t cut and paste the AmigaOS functions into
your code as these are held in librarys, but you *can* paste the source
to the module definitions in your code, however this is strongly
discouraged.

> *3. *How do I do *BOLD* text with EasyGUI

It`s probably something to do with itext, again, ask Ali Graham, he
knows loads about EasyGui (wheras I know nothing :)

Sorry, I don`t know what NewGui is, I`m not into the EasyGui stuff
myself, VisualPrefs is a hack that patches into a number of librarys,
and does lots of nasty things to the OS to give you proper pen
management and those neat new gadgets. I`m afraid, that If it is
causing bugs, remove it from your system.

I also gather it messes with window.inneredge (or something) so if an
application depends on them (and not GIMMEZEROZERO) then it`s liable to
mess up drawing of the edges to the window.

> *5.* Music, Mods, How do I play them ?

Ah.. Tricky, but you`ll have to hunt down some code, I *think* that
OctaMed came with the source for an AmigaE module player, and I
remember seeing something *somewhere*, however I can`t remeber where. A
number of people on this list seem to be doing a lot of audio stuff.

> *6.* How do I create A Cycleing Bar of text that says thind that appear

I`m not quite sure what you mean, but, I think that you want to use
itext, to print it out:

itext:PTR TO itxet

NEW itext

itext.out:=string -> ie string = `Hello`
itext.output:=window

PrintIText(itext, someother, args) -> Print out
Delay(10) -> depends how fast your processor is.
Bar(x,y,x+wid,y+hei,0) -> box clears over the old text
itext.out:=newstring -> ie newstring = `Please`
PrintIText()...
Delay()...
Bar()...

This just shows the logic of what is happening, not the specifics, you
could clear up the code by splitting off parts to go in seperate
PROCedures, and doing other lots of neat things.

You can find modules and sources for playing music in the Psiloplayer.
It's in dev/e and is called Psiloplayer.lha (No way!) on aminet.

Date: Thu, 21 May 1998 21:36:38 +1200
Subject: Dereferencing

Assuming the presence of     DEF val, p:PTR TO LONG

Except in certain specific circumstances, the use of p[] rather than
^p appears to be recommended.  Be that as it may, they can both be
used, either :

  To the right of the := , as in val:=p[]
Or
  To the left of the := , as in p[]:=val

The former case is getting a value, while the latter is changing a
value. Despite the fact that these are fundamentally different
processes, they are both called 'dereferencing'.

Is the above correct?

If so, I wonder what the term 'dereferencing' really means, and why
it is used at all. It sheds little light.

Subject: Re: Dereferencing

Hurah! A question I can (kinda) answer!

Please correct me if I'm wrong.
> Except in certain specific circumstances, the use of p[] rather
than^p
Using p[] is called defrencing an array. This means that an invisble
pointer knows which array you are currently on. For example:

a:=A[]
is the same as
a:A[0] (Do arrays start at 0?)
unless you have done some thing like:
A[]++
In which case
a:=A[]
will be the same as
a:=A[1]

Occasionally you may which to pass a variable by reference. Instead of
just passing the variable, you can pass its location in memory. This
done like so:
dumbproc({a})
This passes the address of the variable. To find out the value at a
particular address a '^' is used:
<inside dumbproc(a)>
b:=^a (otherwise the address will be inserted into b).

^a:=b
Is kind of the reverse and will now put the value of b into a
(remember, a is still an address). If you look at a in the original
procedure you will find that's its value has changed.

There are way better examples of the above inside
dev/e/BeginnersGuide.lha on the Aminet.

here are the os version nos. from RKRM Libraries, edition 3:

30 = OS 1.0
31 = OS 1.1 (NTSC version)
32 = OS 1.1 (PAL version)
33 = OS 1.2
34 = OS 1.3
35 = OS 1.3 with support for A2024 hires monitor
                 (could someone please confirm)
36 = OS 2.0
37 = OS 2.04

the rkrms end here. i think the rest are correct

38 = OS 2.05
39 = OS 3.0
40 = OS 3.1

hope this helps

That's not the point of OSVERSION.
You are meant to look at each AmigaOS call from dos, exec, intuition and
graphics you make, and read its autodocs.
If one of those autodocs says (V36) in the title, you must use OSVERSION 36.
If one says (V37), use OSVERSION 37.

It's so you don't accidentally run on a system where the OS is too old - for
example, AllocVec() is 36+ only.

OSVERSION only affects the version numbers used on E's startupcode
OpenLibrary()s for those 4 libraries (might also affect generated code
for builtins some day soon).

You yourself are meant to use the right version number when
opening other libraries, NEVER 'just use 0'.

As for the version numbers:

0-32 only exist in prehistoric Amigas. Not supported by
Commodore Amiga or anyone else for quite some time.

33 = Workbench 1.2
34 = Workbench 1.3
35 = Workbench 1.3, with hires monitor support (not generally released)

36 = Workbench 2.0 (only in some A3000s)
37 = Workbench 2.04
38 = Workbench 2.1 (disk only, no v38 ROM libraries)

39 = Workbench 3.0
40 = Workbench 3.1
41 = Workbench 3.1 with multibyte char support
42 = The next big thing... current (unreleased) OS version level.
     Library writers (especially the datatypes ones) use it to
     look trendy.

Note that these version numbers don't 'guarantee' a 'Workbench' version -
they
refer only to the major version of the ROM and the libraries within.
Disk-based
libraries generally use the same version numbering for their releases.

It's essential. That doesn't make it good.
Personally I suggest waiting for the new Amiga CD to come out.
I hear they're waiting until they can release the RKRMs on it.

=>it usually is... just C stuff, no E stuff... And I know no C at all...

You're developing for an Amiga? You need the developer CD.

You don't need to know C to use it (although that helps because you can
understand all the example programs and snippets) - but the main point is,
it describes in exact, specific details how each AmigaOS function will
work. This is the same no matter what language you're programming in.

The AmigaOS is not designed to force you to program in C.

The CD also contains debugging tools that really help you, ones that
report the goings on of any Amiga code, not just that created by a C
compiler! This isn't UNIX, not everything is 'geared around' the C
compiler.

It also contains a load of stuff for programming CD32s and creating CDs...

Autodocs... I mean... how are the docs built up?
Is there like a Intuition-section, and in that section there's
a list of commands, plus explainations and examples?
That would be superb... But I don't know how the CD-docs are
built up...  Can someone give me a hint?

V38 is OS 2.1, a disk-only update that added localization and a bunch of
bugfixes
(especially in commodity.library).  2.05 is V37.300, it's mostly 2.04
(37.175)
but with PCMCIA and IDE stuff, and was used in the A600.

I don't have the manual to hand, but IIRC there is a limit of 3 return
values. There is a technical resason for this, but I don't know what it
is.

If you want to return this much data then you can instead return a pointer
to an appropriate structure (possibly one defined specifically for this
purpose), although you will have to allocate it dynamically, since DEFed
variables are automatically deallocated at the end of a PROC.

In this case, however, there is an alternative solution since a and b each
take one of only two values: simply use the following:-

... THEN ab:=%01 ELSE a:=%00
... THEN ab:=ab OR %10
 :
 :
RETURN ab, c, d

Retrieving a and b in the calling procedure should be fairly easy.

Greetings,

I am not really clear on New() and AllocMem() functions and their

For example I have:

DEF buffer

which declares a long variable named buffer.  I can immediately
assign it a value like this:

buffer := 10000

Why would I use this and what does it do exactly:

buffer := New(10000)

On 24-May-98, someone (I think it was Charles Patterson) might have written:

CP> Why would I use this and what does it do exactly:
CP>
CP> buffer := New(10000)

This allocates a memory area of 10,000 bytes, which you could then
use for any purpose that you needed it for. New() tracks the amount
that you allocate, so that when you later did Dispose(buffer) (or,
indeed, the program ends) the correct amount of memory is freed.

Okay.. YOu are an BIG trouble, until you understand dynamic memory
allocation.
 Get a book, or a tutorial and figure it out.

CP> buffer := 10000

Now buffer is equal to the VALUE 10000

CP> Why would I use this and what does it do exactly:

CP> buffer := New(10000)

Now buffer is the ADDRESS of the beginning of 10,000 bytes that has been

AllocMem(size,flags) takes two arguments, size and flags. Size is
the number of bytes you want and with flags you can choose
which memory type you want, cleared or not cleared, public or
not public. It returns the allocated memory which MUST be freed
with FreeMem(memory,size). BTW watch out for freeing memory
twice(CRASH!). Example:

mem:=AllocMem(243,MEMF_FAST)
....
FreeMem(memory,243)

mem:=AllocMem(500,MEMF_PUBLIC OR MEMF_CLEAR OR MEMF_CHIP)
...
FreeMem(mem,500)

The MEMF_* constants can be found in emodules:exec/memory.m
and they are decribed in the autodocs in exec/AllocMem() (Amazing!)

Subject: Newbie quezzie ;)

Hi All,

I've only just started programming in E (as you'll tell from the example),
but I can't figure out how to get a simple program such as the one below to
work.  It's probably something quite simple that I'm mising, but what I want
it to do is tell me the position of the letter 'a' in the string 'This is a
Test!', and return a numerical value to me.  The code below either returns
nothing at all, or an obscure symbol which means nothing to me.

DEF x,y,foundpos

PROC main()
   y:= 'This is a Test!'
   x:= 'a'
   foundpos:= InStr(x,y,0)
   WriteF(foundpos)
ENDPROC

Any help greatly appreciated, also if anyone has an example source of how to
read a file line by line, with it displayed to stdout WITH carriage returns
then that would be great too.

TIA

Roland

        foundpos:=InStr(string1,string2,startpos=0)

searches string1 for the occurrence of string2, possibly starting from
another position than 0. Returned is the offset at which the substring
was found, else -1.

In your example, it cannot possibly find string2 (y) in string1 (x) and
should always return -1.

Ooops.  I forgot to say that I tried it the other way round and that didn't
work either!  Which ever way I put the strings around, it never outputs a

Sorry, simple error and I missed it.
Try this:

  WriteF('foundpos = \d',foundpos)

Hi Roland

I'm fairly new to all this E stuff as well :-)
Try this it worked for me :-)

DEF x[20]:STRING,y[20]:STRING,foundpos

PROC main()
   StrCopy(x, 'This is a Test!',ALL)
   StrCopy(y, 'a', ALL)

   foundpos := InStr(x,y,0)
   WriteF('\d',foundpos+1)
ENDPROC

I'm not saying it's the correct way to do it but it works :-)

You can use ReadStr() (internal function) or Fgets() (dos function).
ReadStr() is unbuffered and slow while Fgets() is buffered and kinda
fast so you should probably use Fgets(). They are used like this:

ReadStr(handle,str)

For example ReadStr(stdout,mystr). It returns -1 if end of file or
error.
str does not end with a linefeed

Fgets(handle,str,length)

For example Fgets(stdout,mystr,1024). Returns 0 when end of file or
error(i think). str ends with a linefeed

Here is an small example:

PROC main()
DEF input,line
IF input:=Open(arg,OLDFILE)
- ->     WHILE ReadStr(input,line)<>-1
- ->     str[StrLen(str)]:="\0"    -> Add a linefeed
- ->     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Only if you use ReadStr()
        WHILE Fgets(input,line,1024)
                WriteF(line)
        ENDWHILE
        Close(input)
ENDIF
ENDPROC

Because I havent eaten in hours this is probably kinda fuzzy.
If there is any typos blame Hotmail!
Anyway good luck. E is a great language!

Well, the best thing to do to unlock files/dirs is to leave it to
the well-established and stable systemmonitors like Scout or
SysInspector. (Xoper is very old...)

If you really want to look up a list of a drive's locks, then you
should really look a good book like GuruBook which details the inner
mechanisms of dos.library - or, alternatively, ask Eric S. nicely :)

This is quite tricky, any reason why you can't use the existing programs

I find the best way to solve this is to use Scout (available on Aminet) to
get rid of any prolonged(sp?) locks although a program that did it faster
and easier would be very nice :)

I've been using a shell-command "unlock" for years (have it configured at a
DirOpus button, but you could call it from your own program as well...)

Guess it's on aminet, otherwise I could send it to you...

From: sanric@ronet.it (Riccardo Santato)
Date: Mon, 25 May 1998 10:41:52 +0100
Subject: CD Player

Hello world !

I own a Toshiba CD drive on my Amiga 1200, driven by ATAPI.DEVICE. If I want
to listen to some CDDAs (the normal 'audio' CDs) I have to plug the jack of
my
headphones directly into the hardware (the CDROM drive itself).

According to me, this is really boring.

I've downloaded from Aminet the OptyCDPlayer archive and I found it very
interesting, because I realised that sending CD tracks trough the amplifiers
of my 1084S monitor was possible; nevertheless this happened only when I was
SAMPLING some tracks, so the little space of my HD was wasted.

I ask to everyone of you if you have clues on how to make a CD player which
use normal monitor amplifiers, even with the use of AHI. Remember that the
device used is ATAPI.

1) Do you have Autodocs for ATAPI.DEVICE ?
2) Do you have E sources for AHI in order to make me learn something more
?!?
3) Do you have suggestions ?

Thank you !

These are standard ATAPI calls. As ATAPI becomes closer to the SCSI

you probably could use these commands.

You can use it just like audio.device, I guess... :)

It is like audio.device, but much easier (no 128 kByte limit for example).
After the weekend I can send you a small example using AHI in E (or have a

From: sanric@ronet.it (Riccardo Santato)
Date: Mon, 25 May 1998 11:16:27 +0100
Subject: "GNU E"

Hello world !

I'm writing U because I think there's the necessity of a new way of
developing
software on Amiga based platforms.

IMHO I suggest to create a new RAD ( Rapid Aided Developing) environment for
AmigaE and a new E compiler which MUST be FREE !
This mainly because if the E language remains in the hand of a single
developer, the improvements will be obviously slow.
This is not Wouter's fault; he has done a GREAT work with E, mainly in the
grammar of the language, which is very easy to understand and as powerful as
C++, but we have to admit the compiler...

1) generates SLOW code because there's no optimization

2) doesn't generate code either for ppc.library OR WarpOs

3) seems to have problems with memory allocation (according to the messages
of
   the list !)

4) doesn't output an ASM source code which can be compiled with other
Assemblers
   (PhX above all)


Wouter itself, in the docs of E 3.3, admit that the compiler is created in
an
"OLD FASHIONED" way, so it's impossible for us to have PPC support and
changes
quite soon. The only fast way to make things happens it's to create a team
of
developers for this kinda language, which covers every aspect of the new
environment, from the compiler to the developing tools. Everything FREE.
It's a sort of "GNU E", without the necessity for the coder to include
sources
in the archives !
Of course, the copyright for Wouter's language GRAMMAR will be respected !!
I think that the work can be EASILY done if we (members of the list)
cooperate
one with the other in order to reduce the effort; in this group there are
persons who knows well assembler, C, E and many other languages.
The new E compiler can be created in E itself !

What are your opinions ?

If you want to join this project, send a mail to the address below (subject
:
"FREE-E member"), in which you have to put...

1)   Name & Surname
2)   E-mail address
3)   WWW pages if owned
4)   Known languages for developing
5)   Preferred language
6)   REGISTERED TOOLS for developing !
7)   Preferences in coding (audio, graphics, exec, intuition,
error-trapping,
RAD
     environment, debuggers, ...)
8)   Suggestions
9)   ...


If the number of the mails will be acceptable, the job will start.

I TRUST IN YOU !!!

Well, just some thoughts on this (sorry that I've been quiet on
this list, actually I'm very busy [really <grin>]).

Some of you fellow Eers might still remember that I'm building
an E compiler in E for some time now. I'd be glad to have some
people with me. The basic framework for the compiler already
exists and can be compiled with just the E compiler.

Did I mention that E2 is planned to be released under the GNU
GPL?

Subject: Status

I have found in the RKRM book how to get the list of tasks currently
available, with their names.
But how can I get the list of the dos processes, with their names, too?
(I only get 'DOS process' or something like that for every process, when
I use the task-list)
I also need the number of these processes, in order to break one of them
(In fact, I look for a specific process, knowing its name, and want to
break it).
Until now I used the "status" command with output sent somewhere in
ram:, parsed the file with ReadStr() and finally deleted that file. This
is quite slow...
How can I do that ?

Just go through the task list, but use this function to get the name:
(from util/boot/MemPatch.lha)

- -> assumes the following:
- ->OPT PREPROCESS
- ->MODULE 'dos/dos', 'dos/dosextens'
- ->DEF unknown[21]:STRING

PROC taskname(p:PTR TO process)

  DEF cli:PTR TO commandlineinterface, name:PTR TO CHAR

  IF p.task.ln.type = NT_PROCESS THEN
    IF cli := BADDR(p.cli) THEN
      IF name := BADDR(cli.commandname) THEN
        IF name[] THEN RETURN name+1, name[]

  IF name := p.task.ln.name THEN
    IF name[] THEN RETURN name, StrLen(name)

  StringF(unknown, 'Unknown @ 0x\z\h[8]', p)
ENDPROC unknown, 20

There's a slightly longer and stricter version in util/boot/GuruLog.lha,
where you're not so sure that the pointer/structures are valid.

=>I also need the number of these processes,

PROC clinum(p:PTR TO process) IS
  IF p.task.ln.type = NT_PROCESS THEN p.tasknum ELSE -1

=>in order to break one of them

No need, use Signal(taskid, SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C)

=>ram:, parsed the file with ReadStr() and finally deleted that file.

Avoid ReadStr() like the plague.
Use dos.library 36+'s FGets()

  DEF line[300]:STRING, fh
  fh := Open('blah', MODE_OLDFILE) -> or whatever...

  WHILE Fgets(fh, line, StrMax(line)-1)
    SetStr(line, StrLen(line)-1) -> chops newline, too
    -> ... use line ...
  ENDWHILE
  Close(fh)

Oh yes - and the point of it returning a length of
string as the second return value, is because that's
exactly how much you're entitled to StrCopy() - and
you should always make a copy before you try to
print it, you can't just use the pointer you got as
it may become invalid any time:

DEF blah[200]:STRING, name, len
name, len := taskname(FindTask(NIL))
StrCopy(blah, name, len)
WriteF('I am called "\s"\n', blah)

There's some example code taken from SysInspector.  Should be easy to adapt
to
your need (just copy the resulting string to your own buffer instead of the
node.ln.name
one.

EXPORT PROC getTaskName(task:PTR TO tc, nodename:PTR TO CHAR)

As you see, all you need is in the task structure, just cast it as a

 Hi!

 I search answers to my questions,

 First:
 Why can i place a Lamp.mcc Object in a ButtonGadget in
 AmigaE ?

 The Button Gadget has a Image, that will displayed in the
 Gagdet. The Lamp Object must be placed on the right site
 of the Image.

 Second:
 Why can i disable the Window Title ?
 When i disable all Window-Gadgets and remove the Title-
 Name, the Title-Line will be not disabled.

 What can i do ?

 sorry for my bad english :-)

There is no a "Button Gadget" in MUI: buttons are just textobjects
with frame and input "habilities".

If you want a button with a lamp object, you'll have to create a
group with a lamp, the text object and give the group a button frame
an input.

I don't remember the attribute, but for sure is there. Check the
window class autodocs (1).

I give the window the following attributes:

      MUIA_Window_Borderless,   MUI_TRUE,
      MUIA_Window_CloseGadget,  FALSE,
      MUIA_Window_DepthGadget,  FALSE,
      MUIA_Window_SizeGadget,   FALSE,

and i write not the MUIA_Window_Title attribute.
But, the window title will displayed as an empty blue line.

@node ID46_0 "Newbie (Getting better ;) (ID46_0)"
From: Roland@cybercor.demon.co.uk (Roland Corbet)
Date: Mon, 25 May 1998 22:25:03 -0000
Subject: Newbie (Getting better ;)

Hi All,

Many thanks to all who replied to my mail from yesterday, it's been a great
help and I've learned a lot :))  However, as usual, evry answer leads to a
bigger question ;)  So, if you don't mind, I'll fire away... ;)

Scenario: I want to question a remote machine (on the internet) and then
captur its response to a local file.  This is easy enough in a telnet
proggy,
as all the data is in the same window, but I want this info to be available
to my proggy.  (I know it may appear that I'm trying to run before I can
walk
with E, but what I'm trying to do is port a farmiliar proggy I have into E,
so that I can farmiliarise myself with things in that manner :) )

After setting up all my necessary variables...

Here goes...

StrCopy(outfile, 'Ram:output', ALL)  /*Define my Local file to write to*/
StrCopy(file, 'TCP:127.0.0.1/79', ALL)  /*Define the site I want to access
as
                                          a string (In this case it is a
                                          local file, finger socket (for
test
                                          purposes)*/
handle:=Open(file,MODE_NEWFILE) /*Set the file handle and type*/
handle2:=Open(outfile,MODE_NEWFILE) /*set the handle for my local file*/
Fputs(handle,'message for server to respond to') /*Write a command to the
                                                  remote machine*/

The remote machine works on this command and then will write its response to
the connection (you can see it in a telnet connection/window)

This loop should catch any info returned...

REPEAT
    t:=ReadStr(handle,string)  /*Read a line from returned data*/
    WriteF(string)  /*Write the data to the shell*/
UNTIL t=0 -> If t=0 the EOF is reached /*do this until the remote machine
                                        closes the connection or ends the
                                        file*/

(Issue appropriate commands to close the local and remote files)

I'm only going on the fact that this works in my Arexx proggy, and I'm
trying
to port the principle across.  Maybe it won't work?  Maybe there's another,
easeier way to do it?  Is there a tcp: console or other modules for E?  If
anyone has any sources which access remote machines, then this would be
really helpful for me to have a look at.

TIA for any infos,

Cheers,

Roland

Use BitmapObjects, like this:

/*...*/
WindowContents,/*If you only want the picture in the window. Otherwise, put
this bitmap object as a child of a group*/
BitmapObject,
    MUIA_Bitmap_Width,123, -> width of the picture
    MUIA_Bitmap_Height,456, -> height
    MUIA_FixWidth,123, /* I am not absolutely sure of the spelling, look
Area class to check. You also have to fix the size, otherwise the picture
is resizeable, which is probably not what you want*/
    MUIA_FixHeight,456, /*same for the height*/
    MUIA_Bitmap_Bitmap,bitmap, /*the bitmap you have loaded*/
    MUIA_Bitmap_SourceColors,palette,/*put here the rgb definitions of the
palette (look bitmap's autodocs)*/
/*Eventually some others tag...*/
End,
End,
/*...*/

To load the picture into a bitmap, I use the AFC's super_picture class and
get the bitmap with pic.bitmap(). Do not forget to free the super_picture
object at the end of the program.

Write, I managed to get that allmost working firsttime (I'm getting better
at this), But I have to leave out the SourceColour , MUIA,I don't know
exactly what to do :( Yo say look at the biitmao autodocs ? Were ? I Comiled
my App, and I get a crashed bitmap (It's better than nothing) I there any
further help you can offer, And what is this supperb.bitmap thing ?

Also you say -> MUIA_Bitmap_Bitmap , /* Your bitmap */ , is this a ->

'ram:file'

or another thing ?

The MUI developer package has an 'AutoDocs' directory.

I spoke about AFC (Amiga Foundation Classes), look
"http://www.intercom.it/~fsoft/afc.html"

No, this is the address of a bitmap structure. So when you load a picture
from
disk (I do it using the super_bitmap module), you can get a bitmap object,
whose
address must be given to this attribute.
Example:

MODULE 'afc/super_picture'
/*...*/
PROC main()
DEF pic:PTR TO super_picture
    /*...*/
    NEW pic.super_picture(FALSE) -> create the super_picture structure
    pic.load('Ram:File') -> I am not sure this is the correct syntax. Look
super_picture.doc for the exact syntax
/*After this command the picture has been loaded. You can get the bitmap
using
pic.bitmap()*/
/*...*/
    BitmapObject,
        /*...*/
        MUIA_Bitmap_Bitmap,pic.bitmap(),
        MUIA_Bitmap_SourceColors,/*put something like
this:*/[$00000000,$00000000,$00000000,/*col 0*/
$11111111,$11111111,$11111111,/*col 1*/,
/*...*/]
/*I know it is awfully annoying to copy those numbers, but I do not know how
to
do else... :-(*/
    /*...*/
/*at the end of the program (e.g. after EXCEPT, if you have one):*/
    IF pic THEN END pic /*to free the super_picture object.*/
ENDPROC
/*...*/

For the colours, I am sorry, but I did not find any other way than copying
the
whole palette of the picture "by hand". (The AFC classes
super_picture (or palette) has a bug, you can't get the palette of a
picture).
If your picture is displayed only once, you can use
MUIA_Bitmap_SourceColors,
look the example in the bitmap autodocs. If it is displayed lots of times,
it is
probably better to allocate the palette yourself and give it to MUI using
MUIA_Bitmap_MappingTable.

Use ASL instead ReqTools !!! Let User define which he like - ASL or RT.
Some people use MUI-ASL and don;t want to see ReqTools. Some people will

Hello, again.

    I've been working with Boopsi for the last while, and my mind keeps
wandering back to these comments in the RKRM source rkmbutclass.e:

- -> E-Note: Intuition may alter the message, so don't use a static list
gpmsg.methodid:=GM_RENDER
gpmsg.ginfo:=msg::opset.ginfo
    [etc]

and later...

- -> E-Note: A bug (?) in Intuition means that the methodid of an OM_NOTIFY
- ->         message may be altered, so you can't get away with just using a
- ->         constant value in the above static list...
msg.methodid:=OM_NOTIFY

My questions:

1) Is there any more information about the nature of this (likely) bug?
2) Is there a more elegant way of avoiding this problem or are the ways
shown above in this program the best solutions?  A dynamically allocated
list instead of a static one?

I have several spots in my Boopsi gadget that need a GM_RENDER message
sent, and that first method above seems so un-E-like.  I'd really prefer
to use a list.

(Hmm, two posts in a row about static v. dynamic lists.  Maybe my brain
doesn't quite have as good a grasp on reality as I thought...:)

Yes, it all brings back horrible memories of the days spent debugging

No, it's a completely undocumented "feature" of method calls in BOOPSI.
As far as I can tell, you basically don't own the message you send.
That is, Intuition feels completely at liberty to alter the message
after you've sent it.  In fact, Intuition even uses your messages to
send *its* own messages!

Anyway, what this means is that the contents of your messages may be
altered so you can't just use a static list for them.  If you do use
a static list, then you'll need to assign the correct values to the
list elements using explicit assignments (like those above), because
the second time you use the list (and make the method call) your
list will have the values the last call altered them to...

There are lots of ways of doing it.  The main thing to be aware of is
that BOOPSI feels free to alter your messages.  So you need to be sure
you anticipate this.  And it's not just a matter of which calls alter
messages at the moment: future versions of BOOPSI may well decide to
alter more method messages.

Basically, what you need to do is be sure the message you send contains
the right data.  You can allocate it statically, dynamically or on the
stack (local var).  But if you do it statically you need to make sure
the message has not been used before or that you've explicitly copied
the correct data into it.

By all means dynamically allocate it.  What NEW <list> will do is create
a new slab of memory and copy the contents of <list> to it.  This way
the <list> will not be altered by any method calls, so the contents will
be the same next time the NEW <list> is executed.  Just remember to
deallocate the result of NEW after the method has been executed (i.e.,
don't assume you can reuse the message without first copying the correct
data into it, because it won't be the same as <list> any more).

The reason that NEW was not used in those RKRM examples is because at
that time there was no FastDisposeList()...

Cheers!

    That seems fair!  If I didn't want Intuition to have my message, I
shouldn't have handed it over. :-)

Hi!

There have already been many answers to the questions
but I wanna add some notes. As an introdution I may
say that I have done much things with MUI, which is
an BOOPSI extension. My greatest project, Plotter3D,
consists of over 50 MUI customclasses and I have run
into lot of problems during the development.

I recommend to *always* use dynamical lists. MUI does the
same nasty things with taglists, eg. filtering by replacing
tags with TAG_IGNORE etc., as in C taglists are always created
on stack.
Also remember that static list may be overwritten by your program/
classes, simply by recursive calls. This can happen for example
if you call set() within your set-method (Note: set() is defined
as SetAttrsA(obj, [attr, value, TAG_DONE, 0]).
I use replacements for all set/doMethod/... funcs.
For example:
  PROC newDoMethodA(obj, dynamtags)
    obj:=doMethodA(obj,dynamtags)
    FastDisposeList(dynamtags)
  ENDPROC obj
  PROC newSetAttrsA(obj, dynamtags)
    obj:=SetAttrsA(obj,dynamtags)
    FastDisposeList(dynamtags)
  ENDPROC obj
  ...
Just call it with newDoMethodA(obj, NEW [...]:tagitem).
It may seem to be a huge overhead but it's error prone
(do you really know, or wanna know (?), what all those
BOOPSI classes do inside) and for an GUI it is fast enough.

Second, many people ommit the >,0< after an TAG_DONE/TAG_END.
Never do this! Just remember, that the initial examples are
written in C, where all tags are passed to an stack-arg
function or taglists are allocated via AllocTagItem() (??).
In both cases the *extra* (not useless) LONG *is* allocated.
I don't know if it matters in standard BOOPSI classes but I
have seen MUI-Programs becoming suddenly very stable just by
adding those little >,0< behind the TAG_DONE's.
So either use typed lists ([..,TAG_DONE]:tagitem) or add
the zero ([...,TAG_DONE,0]).

Hopefully this helps yout not to make the same bad
experiences with all that BOOPSI stuff.

You're not supposed to need this '0' at all.  I've been using taglists for
ages,
both with various OS tagcalls and with BOOPSI ClassAct objects, and never
needed
that NIL value.  The parser is supposed to simply exit  as it reaches
TAG_DONE.

BTW, CA gadgets also work fine with static lists.  Now, I only wish I could
insert
assignations to array entries in a list, not just regular vars.  :/

This works:

StartMember, mybutton := ButtonObject,
   GA_ID, GAID_BUTTON,
EndMember

This returns a syntax error:

StartMember, gadgets[GAID_BUTTON] := ButtonObject,
   gA_ID, GAID_BUTTON,
EndMember

Makes it a pain building any complex GUI in E using the macros, as you have
to
assign one separate var for EACH gadget :(

Subject: FastDisposeList()?

Hello, List.

    Ok, I think I've read and reread the docs and Beginner's Guide until
my brain has a hole in it.  I'm trying to find the proper way to dispose
of something like this:

DEF n
n:=NEW [GTLV_TOP, self.top, TAG_DONE]

the idea being that it's better to avoid using a static list.

1) Should I, at the end of the PROC, use END n or FastDisposeList(n)?
2) Would it make any difference if I:
    a) Used DEF n:PTR TO tagitem
            n:=NEW [GTLV_TOP, self.top, TAG_DONE]:tagitem
    b) simply used n:=[GTLV_TOP, self.top, TAG_DONE], without using
       NEW at all?

I have used NEW/END (as in 1) before, and it seems to deallocate memory
correctly, but the docs state

"freeing memory allocated with any variations of NEW is done
automatically at the end of the program, or by hand with END or
FastDispose().  (note: the only exception is NEW <list>, use
FastDisposeList())"

which after twenty readings has only added to my confusion...

The Beginner's Guide states that if you don't want to make use of the
automatic deallocation at the end of the program and want to deallocate
a list created using NEW then you must use FastDisposeList().  You
*cannot* use END.

So, the answer is use FastDisposeList(n).

> 2) Would it make any difference if I:

It shouldn't matter, although Wouter's documentation isn't very
explicit about this.  The way that lists work internally means that
this is pretty much equivalent to the untyped version (the only
difference being this version allocates one extra LONG for the data
part of TAG_DONE...).

>     b) simply used n:=[GTLV_TOP, self.top, TAG_DONE], without using

You should be aware of the problems that static objects can get you
into.  If the contents of the static object are changed, then the
change will affect all future references to it.  The BOOPSI example
in your later message is a great example of the nasty things that
can happen...

I think it went something like this: Wouter introduced NEW for
allocating copies of lists, and then discovered that this was not
compatible with the original NEW/END, so END could not be used to
deallocate things.  Hence, he needed to come up with an EndList()
function, which he called FastDisposeList(), since NEW uses the
FastNew() function.  Once he'd done this he just made a small
update to the docs.  A rewrite would have been good (and less
confusing), but he's got more important things to worry about.

Cheers!

    There's no point allocating that extra LONG for nothing... :)

    That example is what started me thinking about this in the first

the answer a lot sooner.

    Well, he hasn't forgotten us E users.  It seems he'll be here in
Toronto this weekend at International Amiga, giving a number of seminars
on Amiga E, and one on "Aardappel Experimental Graphical Language", the
one from his website with all the cool graphics.
    If his seminars weren't $30 each, I'd probably attend some, or at
least the Aardappel one.  I've been intrigued for some time about that
one...

Does the use of the 'tagitem' to denote the structure mean that using
END is acceptable? For example, I have (in one of my modules)

    NEW [NIL, NIL, self, NRF_SEND_MESSAGE, port]:notifyrequest

and then later END it. A 'notifyrequest' is actually longer than that,
and contains other items than just straight LONGs/APTRs whatever...
so END seems like the only option, as FastDisposeList() would assume that
the structure was actually in the form of an E-list.

Therefore, while NEW [] / END may not work, it seems logical to me that
NEW []:tagitem / END would... you are allocating a structure and freeing
it, rather than an E-list. The fact that they are internally the same
shouldn't matter -- it's the information the compiler gets when it runs
through there that matters :)

All this IMHO, of course...

Subject: IConvert not up-to-date ?

Hi !

Is it possible, that IConvert is not up-to-date, that means, it can't
create typed-modules ???

Example:

the original include (of course in assembler, not in E :) ) is:

- ------------
MODULE 'exec/ports'

OBJECT bla
   aaa:xxx <- xxx is placed in e.g. exec/ports
...
- ------------

but iconvert does

- ------------
OBJECT bla
   aaa:substructure
...
- ------------

defines like e.g. #define AHINAME 'ahi.device'
get lost during converting.

So, is someone (Wouter ?) able to update IConvert, or is there already an
up-to-date (=3Dtyped-module creating) replacement for Iconvert
(pragma2module) ???

Greetings,

   Rainer

IConvert never has been able to create properly typed modules.  And it
probably never will.

As I've mentioned before, the typed system modules were created by hand,
at great pain to the writer.  It took weeks...

Probably the official (Wouter) line is: Feel free to create your own.
You only need to worry about the subtle differences between the Assembly
and C includes (mainly naming conventions).  Oh, and unions.  And bad
alignments.  And macros.  And other things...

Cheers!

I actually agree that we should use the OS standards. I advise my users t=
o
do this, when I write my programs I use ASL and tell people to patch it
to ReqTools. That way people who like ASL can run ASL, people who like MU=
IASL
can run that, people who want Reqtools can run RTPatch, etc.

If we build in Reqtools as a default people will have to start writing pa=
tches
for that if they don't want to use it. :)

By the way, I use MCP's RTPatch, so as a user I have that as a pretty str=

opinion, but I see no reason I should force the users of my programs to d=
o so. :)

However, they are cases where you need various reqtools features, to avoid
having
to reinvent the wheel, like with some requesters (integer or password

Yes, that's my opinion too. The system (GadTools) integer and string
gadgets are (in my eyes) not very useable. The ReqTools integer requester
is almost perfect (set maximum and minimum value) !! The other requesters
(Font, File, Screen) ReqTools is easier to use than the ASL. I know someone
who is very great friend of MUI, but he preferres ReqTools more the MUI-ASL
!!!=20

This is true, but I would still argue that in those programs ASL should b=

for file requesters etc, with Reqtools only used for its advanced feature=

People wanting to use Reqtools instead of ASL can even install stub ASL l=

If all you need is a file requester and some standard EasyRequest, I agree
that
ASL should be available to the user as an option, if not as THE file
requester
used.

Personally I use getfile.gadget and requester.class.  First one uses ASL,
and
will possibly be able to allow the user to chose between ASL and Reqtools in
the
future, and the second one uses window.class.

Hiya all!

I've got a small ( big ) problem with my program...

It's like this:

   I've attached a file, a procedure from the prog, that =

   you can't compile cuz' you need the who/l/e source!

  But this window slows down the whole programs GUI,
  and I haven't got the slightest idea why...

  The "colombia_compilation.e" is the proc that opens the window,
  and the "colombia_domsg.e" is the proc that takes care of the
  windows message...

  All other windows works fine - but this one messes it up...

   I've been searching in it for errors or something...
   and maybe something obvious passes me by...

   I don't know if you can help me with only these procs...
  but, maybe you could just check em' through...
  if you have the time!

Cuz' the GUI is VERY, superduper *WOW* slow...

 Hm...

When checking for a  certain condition, always put the condition check
between
parenthesis.  I've found that EC 3.3a was more picky than 3.2 there, some of
my
code stopped working in 3.3a until I added () where needed.  Example from
your
code:

WHILE (imsg:=Gt_GetIMsg(complilationwindow.userport))

That way, imsg gets assigned the Gt_GetIMsg() value, and then WHILE checks
if
the () content as a whole is non-NULL.  Do the same for any "IF var :=
function"
or "IF var" statement.

That might not be your problem, but that might help as I had problems with
this
in the past.

Shouldn't there be a Wait() just before the GT_GetIMsg?

As you havn't sent the whole code you may have one just before you call this
routine.

If not, what you're doing is continually getting messages from the windows
msgport, even if there aren't any to get.

If you use a Wait(), then it will only return when you have a message to
handle, and so there will be no slowdown.

Heres an example from a program of my own...

CODE STARTS HERE

#DEF winsigbits#
#DEF received#

#...Open window here etc #

#-> get mask for signal bits#
#winsigbits:=Shl(1,windowptr.userport.sigbit)#

#-> wait for something to happen#
#received:=Wait(winsigbits) #

#-> get message#
#IF imsg:=Gt_GetIMsg(windowptr.userport) #

CODE ENDS HERE

hope this helps, and let us know...

Andy.

Oh boy !! I think the real problem is not the one window, but all the 15
signals !!!
You will have to  optimize/make more efficient  your message handling
procedures !!!=20
e.g. try that all your windows share one message port

In my big project "SampleE" I must handle over 10 windows -> the message
handling was quite slow, I wrote a complete new and, hm well, highly
efficient, procedure -> now it is a lot more quicker !!!

>Hm.... the whole source is like 3000 lines... and I'd rather not leave that
>to other people,

In the worst case only send all your message handling functions...

>But maybe if you could check what is done of the exec file... Maybe it's

=20

I don't think that's the problem, but switch off all your patches and try
again !

Here are some comments, explanations and a suggestion for a new
handling-routine=20

PROC domsg_complilationwindow()
DEF imsg:PTR TO intuimessage, iaddress:PTR TO gadget, c=3D0

    WHILE imsg:=3DGt_GetIMsg(complilationwindow.userport);

        IF imsg.class=3DIDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW;
                IF imsg<>0 THEN Gt_ReplyIMsg(imsg);imsg:=3D0;=09

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
imsg is NEVER zero, because WHILE imsg:=3DGt_... ends your while-wend
structure if imsg is zero
in the case it would be zero, your e.g.  IF imsg.class=3DIDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
would be dangerous, because imsg is NIL and you acesess a structure which
doesn't exist=20
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                closecomplilationwindow()
                RETURN 0;
        ENDIF

        IF (imsg.class=3DIDCMP_GADGETUP) OR (imsg.class=3DIDCMP_GADGETDOWN)
            iaddress:=3Dimsg.iaddress;
            c:=3Dimsg.code                              ***** see above
          =20
            IF imsg<>0 THEN Gt_ReplyIMsg(imsg);imsg:=3D0

this NEVER can be true, too=

                IF imsg<>0 THEN Gt_ReplyIMsg(imsg);imsg:=3D0    imsg is

zero because of the line above marked with ##### !!!!!

always zero because.... see above
                run_prog()
            ENDIF

explanation:

a:=3Dblabla()
IF a=3D1=20
ENDIF
IF a=3D2
ENDIF
....

is much slower than
IF a=3D1
ELSE a=3D2
....
ENDIF
because you do a lot of IF's which are not neccessary
acsessing a structure e.g. iaddress.gadgetid costs a lot of time
you do several IF's which are not neccessary and every not needed IF does a
acsess a structure -> costs a lot of time !

following code should me much faster, the source is smaller and of course
your executable will be smaller too and afterall it does the same (I hope)

PROC domsg_complilationwindow()
DEF imsg=3DNIL:PTR TO intuimessage, iaddress=3DNIL:PTR TO gadget
DEF class=3D0,code=3D0, gadget=3D0

    WHILE imsg:=3DGt_GetIMsg(complilationwindow.userport);
       class:=3Dimsg.class
       iaddress:=3Dimsg.iaddress
       code:=3Dimsg.code
       Gt_ReplyIMsg(imsg)

       IF class=3DIDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW
          closecompilationwindow()
          RETURN 0

       ELSEIF (class=3DIDCMP_GADGETUP) OR (class=3DIDCMP_GADGETDOWN)

          gadget:=3Diaddress.gadget

          SELECT gadget                                 -> SELECT
iaddress.gadget is not possible :-(
                 CASE  BUNREF; openunrefwindow()
                 CASE BVIEW;    view_source()
                 CASE BRUN;      run_prog()

Hello all,

Firstly, a confession : I can't see the bug. On my machine the program runs
fine, with no slowdown at all. What am I doing wrong? I've opened every
window, changed options, and compiled several of my programs with it, and it
seems fine...

Unless I'm missing something fundamental here, I would respectfully suggest
that you have a patch on your system which is causing trouble. The patches I
have are, in order of running:

elfloadseg (for ppc programs)
idefix
newicons
mfsmount
rexxmast
caprefs (classact prefs)

Everything else is standard, except for a load of assigns.

Weird... I'm using a A1200, 68030 50Mhz.  2Chip, 16 Fast....
What's you config?!

When I start it twice - to get the control window up,
and then press the compilation-gadget. When that
window opens I can clearly see that it's slow like treacle...

Very strange... Anyone else who it works good for??

Ok...

I removed all my extra stuff except Newicons and Classact, that is:
MCP, Opus 5.661 Magellan and Betteredit

yes... I'd actually like to try out the shared msg ports thing first...
I'm working now to optimize the message-handler procedures
like Rainer M=FCller suggested...

Could someone help me with the Shared ports thing... Cuz' my wait()-thing=

looks like this:

#signal :=3D Wait(workwindow_signal OR listwindow_signal OR commodity_sig=
nal
OR#
#    sourceinfowindow_signal OR windowswindow_signal OR appwindow_signal =
OR
#
#    complilationwindow_signal OR rx_signal OR prefswindow_signal OR
ecoptwindow_signal OR #
#    appearancewindow_signal OR screenlistwindow_signal OR#
#    unrefwindow_signal OR showbufwindow_signal OR startupwindow_signal)#=

                          =

Rather fat, huh?

But if the shared-port thing doesn't improve anything I will concider to
send
the source to some of you...

A1200T, 68040 @ 25MHz, 2MB chip and 32 MB fast in 2*16MB SIMMS

Your setup should be slightly faster than mine, as the 040 on the PPC board
is crap.

Well David, I use ECompile.ced v2.11 script instead. It's faster to just

As I use my Colombia I just press F1 in GoldEd (4.7.2) - since I'm adding=

an ARexx interface you can change the options in the program
from ie. a menu in GoldEd, or a dock-gadget... And GoldED is more
or less built up with ARexx, so they'd be a good combination -
at least that's why I'm making the prog!

If then, after a compilation in ie. GoldEd, there is an error in the
source...
You can make the editor jump to the line where to error occored...
using simple ARexx (you gotta' love it)    :)

Well the last function ECompile.ced already have :)
And ALOT more!!! :)))  Version string handling too..
Check it out at util/rexx/ecompile.lha

btw this script allows different configs for each source, how does
your Colombia do it? Or do I have to change for each source???

So what for I will use Colombia (I don't saw it yet) ? I have very short
ARexx script which simply Saves, compiles and asks for run a program. If
there be an error editor will jump to errorline - It's simply as it whould
be.

Aha... You're right...

a value can never be two things.. So if one is true, another one can
impossibly be true too!!
So logical... and I missed it... :P   tolly ho!!

I guess that SELECT is faster than IF/ELSE since you used in the code... =

Hm... it might got optimized a bit, but I didn't notice it cuz' of the st=

To make Windows share their Message-Ports you have to do it like that:

I don`t know if you could compile it (because i had written it now in
3 Minutes and the Modules are missing), but it shows how Messageport-
Sharing (and IDCMP-Sharing, because it is needed here!) is done!

I'll better check the rest of the code after more IFs as well... Thanx

But I'd still like to make the windows ports sheared... cuz' the GUI is
still quite slow compared to yours in the SampleE, M=FCller...

And now I saw that Grundler just send instructions to how you do it!!
I'll try it and then I'll let ya' all know how it went!!

Sorry, but that code is wrong :)

The IF (blah AND x) case allows your code to call all necessary functions
even
if two signals are raised at the time you check for them.  In your SELECT
case,
if two of these are set at the same time, then NONE of the CASE will be
called,
as you are doing a direct compare, not a logical test.  So you don't have
much
choice but to AND every signal bit separately to check if they are set.

Don't forget to have some default case if none of your CASES match.
Make it say "whops, missing case for this" or something, so your betatest=

Subject: SELECT

Hi everyone

While I was reading the messages, I noticed one from David Lidstrom
RE: My gui slows down but not as much as before.

In it he said that he changed IF/THEN to

SELECT blah

CASE Blahblah

ENDSELECT

I am writing a prog launcher :-) Yes I know there's loads of them but I want
to try it.
It's my first E-Prog so it's been a good project to learn with.

Anyway, I was using lots of IF/THEN for swapping buttons. I have changed it
after reading the above message and my prog still works fine.

Here's my question, which is the best to use IF/THEN  or SELECT/ENDSELECT?
and if they both can do the same job, why is one better than the other?

I am still fairly new to E, I only started in March this year.

Thanx in advance

Andy

Well, the thing is, SELECT is a special kind of construction for comparing
one
variable to a load of different values. IF is a very general decision-making
(comparison/branch) construct.

I can guarantee you will use IF a lot more than you'll use SELECT. But if
what
you are doing is

IF x = 1 THEN ..
ELSE IF x = 2 THEN ...
...

then you are better to use a SELECT/CASE construction, because it is shorter
and neater.

For example, you could do a FOR loop like this:

FOR x := 1 TO 10 DO blah(x)

or

  x := 1
again:
  blah(x)
  x := x + 1
  IF x <= 10 THEN JUMP again

But clearly the FOR loop is much more readable than the IFs and JUMPs.
The idea behind high-level languages is that they provide constructs that
allow you to do very common operations in a efficient, and understandable
way.

As soon you have more than two choices, SELECT/ENDSELECT is better,
especialy
if your values are within a small range, in which case you can use SELECT
<max_val>
OF <expression>, which is quite fast as it uses an indexed table from what I
can
remember.

Right! it has to be: =

msg:=3Dnext

because next is defined above! (as next:=3Dmsg.ln.succ, which had to
become: next:=3Dmsg.mn.ln.succ !!! Because i had the wrong PTR to
Object (msg / Intuimessage) defined!)

Now all should be all right...

As i said before i hadn`t look after every Modul and Object-Name...
Im just learning for my ABI (A-Level Exam...) and so i had only
a few time left for programming...

Have a nice day :-)

Hi All,

I've looked through the MUI autodocs I've got, but I can't find what I'm
looking for, so...

Could anyone give me a brief example of a 'DoMethodA'.  What I want it to do
is this.

I have a button, 'bt1' is its handle.

When pressed, I want to go to a procedure.

I know this isn't too hard, but when you're new to E, trying to suss out how
to do things without any docs is a bit awkward.

TIA for any info.

Cheers,

Roland

syntax: doMethodA(destinationobject,[methodname,eventually some arguments])

If you want to do notification,
setup it just after having created your application structure (something
like
app:=ApplicationObject,/*...........*/,End), like this:

doMethodA(app,[MUIM_Notify,object_that_needs_notification,MUIA_theattribute,its_value,destobj,num,method_to_execute,and,its,arguments])

Explanation: app is the name of your application, always send your
MUIM_Notify
there.

MUIM_Notify is the method that says you want to set up a notification

object_that_needs_notification is the name of the object you want to "watch"

MUIA_theattribute is the attribute that must be "looked at"

its_value is the value of the attribute you want to trigger the notification
(when the attribute gets to this value, your method will be called) you can
use
MUIV_EveryTime if you want your method to be called everytime the attribute
is
changed.

destobj is the object you want to recieve a message when the notification is
triggered.

num is the number of items following (the items defining the method to be
sent)

and after these values, put the name of the method followed by its arguments
(do
not put [] around these!).

For you:

doMethodA(app,[MUIM_Notify,bt1,MUIA_Pressed,FALSE,app,2,MUIM_Application_ReturnID,<id>])

This will send the attribute <id> (replace it by a value, or better, a
constant
defined by CONST) to your application everytime the button is pressed and
then
released.

And in the input loop:
/*...*/
SELECT id
CASE ID_BT1 /*put here the same id as in your notification method, instead
of
ID_BT1*/
    /*...  This code will be executed when the button bt1 is pressed ...*/
/*... Maybe other ids*/
ENDSELECT
/*...*/

                                            Maxime

I don't have any source, but I was once on a similar quest, and you might
want
to check out some pee-cee programming sites.. they will have C-sources to
show
you the algorithms..

The most confusing part of the LZW stuff is the way they combine it with
huffman.  Try to figure out the search-replace-index part before you wrap
your
head around huffman.  They are both simple alone, but really weird when you
are looking at sources..

If you find something good... try to write a .m file that you can use
comfortably, and share it with the rest of us.. E could use a compression
library badly, and XPK, while pretty good, doesn't link right in..

Be careful though: remember that any for-profit software (including
Shareware) which uses LZW will require a licence from Unisys.

Hmm, the mistake is in your input loop.
1)The MUIM_Application_NewInput method returns an ID if there is any wait=
ing.
2)MUIM_Application_Return_ID is just a constant, that defines the method,=
 like
any other MUI?_#?  ! You can't get a value or anything out of it! (And wh=
y did
you put '123' instead of 123 ? The returned value is a simple integer.)

So put something like:

 WHILE (result:=3DdoMethodA(app,[MUIM_Application_NewInput,{sigs}]) <>
MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit
    IF result =3D 123 THEN spam()
    IF sigs THEN sigs:=3DWait(sigs) /*I think it is better to put the Wai=
t()
command at the end. So your proc is executed as soon as the message arriv=
ed*/
ENDWHILE

And if you have a lot of return values, use SELECT:

SELECT result
CASE 123
    spam()
CASE 234 /*...*/
ENDSELECT

Of course you aren't required to make a separate proc for each return val=
ue. You
can e.g. do:
CASE 123
    WriteF('Search button pressed!\n')
    /*some code following...*/
ENDSELECT
                                            Maxime

Hi, I've changed the code as you said, but it still doesn't work.  I've e=

used 123 instead of 123. I've got result displayed to Stdout, and it alwa=

returns -1 when the ap is running, and 0 when I close the app.  It's as

   Hello,

If I compile a module, and when compiling, it comes up...

  UNREFERENCED: iconbase, workbenchbase

Does that mean I need to open and close those libraries in
my module, even if it works ok without them open?

Problems for evolution and the big bang - #41/168

In all the fossil record, comprising of millions  of  fossils,  not  a
single  transitional  form  is to be found. Evolutionists cannot blame
the size of the record, as Darwin hinted, for  the  absence  of  those
forms.  According  to  Newell,  an evolutionist: 'Many discontinuities
tend to be  more  and  more  emphasised  with  increased  collecting'.
Simpson,  one  of  the  world's foremost evolutionists wrote: 'Regular
absense of transitional forms, is not  confined  to  mammals,  but  is
almost  a  universal  phenomenon.  It  is  possible to claim that such
transitions are not recorded because they did not exist'.

No, it just means that you've included modules which have those
as global variables (i.e. the library modules, so you can use
the library calls) and haven't referred to them at all in the
module.

Of course, in the program that calls these functions, you
have to have opened the appropriate libraries, or your code
will crash when it reaches these calls.
