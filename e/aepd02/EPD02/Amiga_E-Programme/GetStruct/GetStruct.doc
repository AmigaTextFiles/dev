   WHAT IT IS

GetStruct is a structure/object lookup routine for Cygnus Ed.  Hit a
function key, pull up the include/header/object file that contains
that structure or object and place the cursor on it.


   WHAT YOU NEED

header files
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Either the C= header (*.h) or include (*.i) files or the ascii version
of the E object files (*.txt).  The amigaedocs.LHA archive contains
these or you can ShowModule the individual *.m files.

some assigns
~~~~~~~~~~~~
include_h: <dir that has the *.h files>
include_i: <dir that has the *.i files>
include_m: <dir that has the *.txt files>

index files
~~~~~~~~~~~
Each directory needs an INDEX file.  ParseInc builds these:
      parseinc h >include_h:INDEX
      parseinc m >include_m:INDEX
      parseinc i >include_i:INDEX
'parseinc ?' will remind you of the usage.

Cygnus Ed F-Key assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Put GetStruct.ced in REXX:  and assign a CED function key (or macro)
to 'rexx:getstruct h' ('i' for the asm includes or 'm' for the E
objects).

That should do it.


   SOME POSSIBLE PROBLEMS

nothing happens when you hit the function key
   - you may need to set the script bit on REXX:GetStruct.ced or
     use 'rx' in the CED key assignment

CED requester says something like 'can't find include_x:INDEX'
   - include_x: isn't assigned
   - ParseInc hasn't been used to build the INDEX file

ParseInc won't run
   - it requires rexxarplib.library (and arp.library) for the
     filelist() function

you're getting a different word than the one under the cursor
   - strange custom tab settings

the include file gets loaded, but the cursor isn't being positioned on
the structure name.
   - 'uc==lc?' is toggled off in the search requester.  You can set
     that parameter in 'GetStruct.ced', but the quote nesting is
     tricky.  General form is something like
         'search for' text '0 1 1 0'
   - you may have to alter the search statements at the end of
     the script.
