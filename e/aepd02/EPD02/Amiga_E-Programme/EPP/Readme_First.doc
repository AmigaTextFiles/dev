GETTING STARTED.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The directories in this archive have the same structure as the original
E V2.1b directory structure with the exception of the addition of the
E/Pmodules directory and the E/Sources/Examples/EPP_Examples* directories.

See E/Docs/EPP.doc for copyright notice, a full description of what EPP is,
and instructions on how to use EPP.

How to use the examples (CLI only):

    1.  Copy archive contents into the corresponding directories in which
        you have installed E.
    2.  CD to the E directory.
    3.  Make the following DOS assignments:

        PATH bin add  ;If you have not already done so.
        ASSIGN PMODULES: PModules

    4.  Example1:

        a.  CD to the directory E/Sources/Examples/EPP_Example1.  Type:

            EPP mod0 main  ;This produces the E source program main.e
            EC main        ;This compiles the E source program main.e

        b.  The program main can now be run (although it will not do
            anything.)  You may have noticed that E informs you of some
            unused identifiers (well, okay, all the identifiers in this
            example are unused.)  This example uses empty E structures in
            modules nested 5 deep to demonstrate what EPP does.  Look at the
            main module mod0.e and try to follow the module nesting.  Then
            look at the file main.e to see what the final output looks like.

    5.  Example2:

        a.  CD to the directory E/Sources/Examples/EPP_Example2.  Type:

            EPP args main  ;This produces the E source program main.e
            EC main        ;This compiles the E source program main.e

        b.  The program main can now be run.  This example uses some real
            modules.  It accepts command-line arguments and displays the
            values.  Run it without arguments first to find out the usage.
            Then play with the arguments until you get a feel for what is
            happening.  Then look at the original source code in files
            args.e, E/PModules/commandLineArguments.e, E/Pmodules/skipWhite.e,
            and E/skipNonWhite.e.  Finally, look at the source code in file
            main.e to see how EPP brought the original files together.

        c.  Return to step a for each of the tests in the EPP_Example2
            directory.

EPP is not very robust, but it is very simple to use.  The examples provided
should be adequate to demostrate how to use EPP.  See the file
EPP/Docs/EPP.doc for additional details and hints, copyright notice, and
credits to others.

CAUTION:  This caution is repeated in EPP.doc.  In the instructions for
compiling the examples the output file main.e is used.  You are not
restricted to using this name as the final output name.  You are encouraged,
however, to come up with a personal convention for naming the final output
file.  That way you will not risk accidentally overwriting your original
source.  One suggestion is to set up a separate directory to receive the
final output file and compile it there:  a directory in RAM: or RAD: is
ideal for this, and you could easily set up a script to make the process
less unwieldy.
