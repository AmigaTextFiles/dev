This doc was cooled by the wonderfull cool command by DDT of the HALF-BRAINS
TEAM (see aminet/text/misc/cool).

@node overview "Get into the overview"
You know the More command of AmigaDos ? Now you have More working with xpk.
Let's say what it is. You probably got xMore (it stole my name), Most,
MuchMore. Yes, they seem nice when you read the docs. But I tested some of
them and they crash on my machine. But it doesn't convince me yet to make my
version. Let's say these proggys have an arrex port, a nice gadtools
interface, configuration files, a big size, load all the file in memory
(here is the problem), etc, etc... But I just need a More command working
with xpk. I explain you the principal interest of More : you can display a
file that is LARGER THAN YOUR AVAILABLE MEMORY !!! And now your file may be
packed with xpk. A simple note : with xPage you may open files packed or
unpacked. Renote : now your More (let's say xPage) is half the original.

@node interface "Interface view"
I did a good usage of messages. You have a status title bar that displays
the number of lines, of pages, the % usage. The values are always correct
you can test ! When you search, you can search for several strings
(separate them with a "|"). You can print the page displayed. Press HELP
while viewing to get these commands :

     HELP - this help
        t - top of chunk
        b - bottom of chunk
    SPACE - next page
BACKSPACE - previous page
    ENTER - next line
        p - print current page
        / - search for strings (separate them with "|")
        n - search again
        j - jump to next chunk
        r - rewind
      ESC - quit

Resizing the window will resize the display.

@node story "Ok, here's my story"
I'm a student on computer science (informatique as we said in France) and I
work as a programmer on PC's, I'm 25, have a girlfriend I love (as
everybody).

I program with a very little machine : it's an amiga 600 with no extensions.
The reason if I didn't upgrate is because I want to do marvellous things
with my little machine. I have my machine for years now but I never feel so
happy with it because I discovered the programmation on it. I never could
really program due to my few ressources. And what can you do with only one
floppy drive ? Thank's God I discovered E language lossed somewhere on my
disks and Amiga OS. I can put all E in only one disk and there is space
left. That's wonderfull. Thanks to that I could program since a coupple
of monthes a few programs and spread it to the amiga community like
util/dir/All, util/cli/FR-Sort, dev/debug/Rem,
util/pack/xpkSource.lha/e/xPKE. My philosophy is : use all you need in few
ressources. I don't need the super-computer because I can't use it at 100%.
I have more projects for guys who have a little system like mine : make a
mem doubbler, a transparent depacking program like xData but the file
decompresses part to part. It's more the concept of util/pack/epu but with
plain xpk files. I would appreciate some info you can give me.

A relationship installed itself beetween me an my A600. Together we
discovered aminet, very educative libraries like XPK. Nobody who have PC's
know all we know about compression, imagery, new programmation, system.
They just know excel, word, access, windows, pkzip, arj, dos. What a pity.
If I tell to my colleagues  what we do with our amigas they couldn't
understand. They have super sound cards but they only use ther bip on
ther games. I with only a 1 meg machine play sound, view pictures,
animations. I create. Tell that to them and they don't believe you. I
would really feel happy if the amiga story didn't stop (at left the
machine construction) and was not so commercial at side of commodore.
