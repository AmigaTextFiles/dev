Amiga E modules and example for filevirus.library 2.8

You'll need the library from util/virus/filevirus28.lha

Copy the modules to EMODULES:, then you can recompile the example.
The example simply prints all the virii known by the library.

If you have any trouble with the E conversion, mail me at the above address.
