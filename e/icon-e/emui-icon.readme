Amiga E modules and example for Icon.mcc 1.1

You'll need the library from dev/mui/MCCIcon_1_1.lha to run the example.

Copy the modules to EMODULES:, then you can recompile the example.
Run the example as 'icondemo iconfilename'.

If you have any trouble with the E conversion, mail me at the above address.
