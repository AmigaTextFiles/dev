Hi all,

Got something in the mail you might be interested in.
This little util will eat the EMODULES: subdirectories
(well, taste them, actually:), slosh around in its
mouth all the modules it finds therein, along with
ShowModule, and spit out all the output into a nicely
formatted Amigaguide file.  I'm in the process of
comvincing the author, Robert Bromley, of rewriting
it in E and adding a coupla features.

Also from Robert, an ARexx script to compile E programs
from within the Edge compiler.
