In this archive are two module for AmigaE with which its posible to use
gtlayout.library by Olaf 'Olsen' Barthel
(also in this archive) docs for library are taken from term-43-source.lha .
gtlayout.m Mod was convertet to with fd2module by Alex McCracken and
libraries/gtlayout.m was converted from original gtlayout.h by me.

read gtlayout.doc for more infos about programieng with gtlayout.library
and you should also have some literature how to programing in gadtools.library
(gtlayout needs gadtools in another words for use gtlayout funktions You
must open gadtools.library also)

Thats All Folks use it spreed it it`s PD
