	Just thought I'd stick a little note in here to give you some warnings,
etc.. This is not a very good commodity. I hacked it up for a buddy of mine,
and it does work, reliably, but that's all it does. It probably is not a good
example of how to program commodities. Give it a look though. The tooltype
code can just be transplanted to any other program as long as you take the
modules, variables, libraries etc over as well.
	I've commented it up a little, but they're also may be some bugs, as the
tooltype code is from another, different commodity I am in the process of
writing for a different friend. That one is not finished yet, so I couldn't
give you it's source. This one, however, was finished, so I just ripped the
tooltype code out of one and planted it into the other. The transplant seems
to have been a success. If you need any help with it, or whatever else, drop
me some mail. ao443@freenet.carleton.ca
