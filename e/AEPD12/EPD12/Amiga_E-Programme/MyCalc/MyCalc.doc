What to say about MyCalc?
-------------------------

As I needed a program that can calculate expressions I've looked at the
source of an calculator coming with the Amiga_E package. But I didn't saw
the sun at the horizon and so I took my Amiga and wrote my own one. The
result is a source of an simple calculator which you may use in your
own projects. To expand the functionality shouldn't be so hard for an
E-programmer. If you find any bugs or if you want to write about anything
else, here's my address: Nico Max
