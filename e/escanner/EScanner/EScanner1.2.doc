          GoldEd section scanner for the Amiga E language

REQUIREMENTS

    GoldEd V3 or higher.  I don't know if earlier versions can use it.
     It does work with version 4!

    Any Kickstart, but V2.04+ would be good for running GoldEd!

    Apart from that, any Amiga .  Despite what Dietmar says, I find 
     GoldEd is _fine_ on my creaky old revision 6 A500, and runs at a
     pretty good speed too....

    Amiga E by Wouter van Oortmersson, any version.  It's a wonderful
     language, much nicer and much better suited to the Amiga than C.
     Download your demo version from (Aminet)/pub/dev/e now!  You won't
     find a better development environment (WITH Amiga V40 includes) for
     around 26!  (Mind you, I suppose you have it already :-)



WHAT'S THIS THING THEN?

EScanner is a Amiga E section scanner for GoldEd.  GoldEd uses it, when
you're editing E source code, to find all the PROCs, OBJECTs, and assembly
labels and present them in a list.  When you click on items in the list,
you are automatically taken to the correct point in the file.

There are a few things you need to know for EScanner to work properly.

    The scanner is case sensitive.  Well, so is EC; it'd be silly if
     it weren't!

    PROCs and OBJECTs can _only_ be detected if they start within 16
     characters of the start of the line.

    ENDPROC and ENDOBJECT are always ignored.

    "->" causes the PROC or OBJECT to be ignored.

    The presence of a "*" before PROC or OBJECT also causes it to be
     ignored.  This allows you to talk about PROCs and OBJECTs in your
     documenting comments without them being picked out.  Consequently,
     you'll need to use the following sort of comment to make this work:

          /*
          **   Talkin' about PROCs :-)
          */

     ...or anything else that has an asterisk before it.

    It follows, then, that the PROC or OBJECT will still be detected if
     you comment it out like this:

          /*
          PROC commented_out()
               bags_of_code()
          ENDPROC
          */

     It would probably be possible to detect this condition, but the
     added complexity is hardly worth it, especially since it's quite
     useful.  You can just stick an asterisk before the PROC if you don't
     want it to show up!

    Assembly label scanning has been simplified for reasons of speed.
     Rather than check for a completely valid label, I just check for a
     lowercase alphabetic (ie, "a"-"z" _only_) in the _first_ column,
     then scan the line for a colon ":".  This means you can't indent
     your labels; sorry, but the alternative is too slow, and this is the
     standard for Motorola assembly anyway.  Conversely, you need to make
     sure that nothing else with a colon in it gets into the left margin:

          -> Comment starts from the margin
          OBJECT example
               thiswillwork:PTR TO LONG           -> Use this...
          thiswont:INT                            -> ...not this!
          ENDOBJECT

The source code in assembly language is included if you want to check it
over.

Ok?



HOW DO YOU INSTALL THE DAMN THING?

The EScanner file can go anywhere, but "golded:scanners" would be
sensible (for GoldEd 4 - "golded:Tools/Scanner" for version 3, I think).

Although EScanner was written originally for GoldEd 3, and it works fine
with it, I found it quite difficult to install it in a way that GoldEd
could actually remember.  I managed it in the end, but I can't remember
how I did it!  :-)

In version 4, you have to call the FUNC SMART command, click the "Mode"
button, and hit "Add".  Open the EScanner file with the file requester,
then type "#?.e" into the pattern string gadget.  Finally, save the
config.  That's it.
