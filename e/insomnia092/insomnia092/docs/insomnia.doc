   Insomnia needs the assign "E:" to be present.
   If it is not, assign it to the drawer that you put insomnia in.
   
   If you have Wouters EC3.3a archive installed somewhere on your system,
   add that path to "E:". Not absolutely needed but useful.
   
   Example:
   
      ASSIGN E: <insomnia_drawer> <ec33a_drawer>
      
   
   Thats it.  
   
   By registering, You get a keyfile. Put the keyfile in "E:". ("E:keyfile.insomnia").

      previous line.
      
   BACKSPACE
   
      Delete previous character by "backing over it" with the cursor.
      If there is no previous character on the line, than moves the
      cursor to end of previous line. 
      
   TABULATOR
   
      Always inserts a specified number of spaces at cursor position.

      The cursor may be moved freely in any direction by using the cursor-keys.
  
   LEFT ALT + numpad <ascii #>
   
      This converts the ascii number into a character and inserts
      it into the text.

     o Search / Replace Window --------------------- (AMIGA + Y)
     
        This window allows entering information about
        strings to search for in the text, strings to
        replace with in the text.

        From this window, compilation may be done by
        pressing the "Compile" gadget, Setting compiler
        options by pressing the "Options" gadget, and 
        selecting alternative sources to compile by pressing
        the "Select" gadget. Complicated huh ? :)
        To get back to the first page again, press the
        "Result" gadget.
        
        The compiler output is shown on the Result-page.

        But you already guessed that :)

    o Execute Window ------------------------------- (AMIGA + 4)
     
        Note: The ability to set the stacksize is not
        very useful for E-programs as they allocate their

     o Build Window -------------------------------- (AMIGA + 5)
