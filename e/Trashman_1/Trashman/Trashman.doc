Intro:

Well,  here's  a small program someone out there might like.  Trashman
places  a  notification  on the last file it finds in the user defined
directory  (defaults  to  SYS:Trashcan).   If  no  files are found, an
"empty" image is copied to the icon.  Otherwise, a "full" image is.

I know there are tons of trashcan programs.  Well, this one ain't much
smaller.   The executable is only 3.5k, but when run a whopping 31k is
required!   Damn  E coding...  Anyways, I was bored.  So use it, abuse
it, or trash it.


PLEASE.  Before you run this program, make sure you have backed up any
original icons.

To install, copy the "Trashman" icon into your WBStartup drawer.  Then
open  the  WBStartup  drawer,  select  the  copied  icon,  and  select
Information from Workbench.

Edit the WATCHDIR tooltype to point to the trashcan directory you wish
to be watched.
  WATCHDIR=myharddisk:temp/trashcan
  WATCHDIR=SYS:TRASHCAN
  WATCHDIR=dh0:garbage           (etc, etc)

Now,  edit  the TRASHCAN_FULL and TRASHCAN_EMPTY tooltypes to point to
some  images.   DO  NOT USE THE ORIGINAL IMAGE HERE.  This won't work!
Also,  DON'T  INCLUDE  THE  .info on the names!  If you want, copy the
supplied   def_trashcan.info   and   def_fulltrashcan.info   icons  to
ENVARC:sys  *and* ENV:sys, and leave these tooltypes blank.  These are
the  defaults.   Also, the icons do not neccessarily have to be of the
"trashcan" variety, as only the images are copied over.

I hope this is enough to get you up and running.


Some notes about StopTM.

Included  is  a small program that signals Trashman to quit.  Trashman
*must*  be named Trashman, and it is CASE-SENSITIVE.  You will not get
any  message  stating  that it's quit.  Basically, StopTM finds a task
named "Trashman" and signals it with a CTRL-C.  You can do any of this
will a good program like X-Oper.
