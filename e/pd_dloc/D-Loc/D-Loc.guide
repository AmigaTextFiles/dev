@{b}Introduction
************@{ub}

    I've made this program, because I don't like typeing the
locale things, like cd ct files and modules. This program has
nearly the same concept to similar programs for C language, but I
think it's more simple.

    This program is written in @{"PowerD" link powerd} language!

@node p_strings " Pages - Strings"

@{b}Strings
*******@{ub}

This page contains three objects.

'Souce file:' is the source you've read. This is the basic name
of the project, because the program creates the filenames from
this string.

There's two more objects, two lists which contains the strings.
The strings you want to use in catalog files are in 'Used' list
and the other strings are in 'Deleted' list. If you want to move
an entry from a list to other just use 'Edit/Move' menu or the
'F6' function key to do.

For the moment you cannot move up or down the entries in the
lists. Maybe it will be feature somoe of the future versions.
This function make a problem. You cannot append easily the
project files, because the program reads the strings line by
line. The new string goes to the bottom of the list and when you
save, the strings replaced.

If you need to move up/down function, please write @{"me" link author} and I will
make it.

@endnode

@node p_settings " Pages - Settings"

@{b}Settings
********@{ub}

This page helps you to set the way of saving. It can be devided
two parts.

The strings used to put informations into the catalog translation
file. 'Catalog name','Catalog version' and 'Catalog revision'
informations added to the version string of catalog translation
file. 'Catalog language' is the language of the catalog file.

There is one more string 'Macro name'. It is the name of the
macro what you want to add to the source. All of the strings in
the original source will be repleced to this macro and some
numbers. In previous versions of program it was a constant name,
but one of the users ask me to make my program AmigaE compatible.
I hope there is some AmigaE users in the Amiga Community.
Although I prefer PowerD. Don't anyone of AmigaE users want to
change? :)

Let's see the five checkmarks!

@{i}Save files in AmigaE format @{ui}

As I mentioned above from version 1.1 the program handles AmigaE
sources. If you check, the program saves the generated files in
@{"AmigaE format" link amigae}.

@{i}Make module@{ui}

If you check this, the program creates a module what contains the
strings. The strings aren't in the source code. Be careful! You
have include this module to the source code with MODULE. If you
didn't check the strings placed to the second argument.

@{i}Create cd file @{ui}

If you check, program saves the catalog description file. If you
really want to localize you need this file.

@{i}Create ct file @{ui}

Saves catalog translation files. You can edit the translated
strings in this file. Next line from the descriptor (MSG_<num>)
is the place of the new strings.

@{i}Make source @{ui}

Makes the localized code. Replaces all the used strings to the
macro.

@node m_source " Menu - Source"

@{b}Source
******@{ub}

@{i} Read... @{fg shine}L @{fg text}@{ui}

This is the first menu what you have to use when start a new
localizing. It reads the PowerD (or AmigaE) source and collects
all the strings. All of these strings goes into the 'Used' list.
ofr ore inforation please read @{"Usage" link usage} section.

@{i} Append... @{fg shine}A @{fg text}@{ui}

From version 1.2 the project files should be appended. Not so
seriuos thing. When you select a file, the program collects the
strings and add to the 'Used' list. The difference between this
method and Read is the lists won't be cleared before the load.

@node m_edit " Menu - Edit"

*****@{ub}

    Don't you know how to create your localized code for your
@{"PowerD" link powerd} source? Now you can learn it step by step.

@{i}Step 1: @{ui}

    First of all you need a @{"PowerD" link powerd} source to read. ;) Just
load it by menu 'Source/Read...'.

@{i}Step 2: @{ui}

Edit the string lists anyway you want. If you use menu
'Edit/Remove' the selected entry moves to the non selected list.
'Used' list contains the strings you want to localize in your
code and 'Deleted' list contains all the strings you don't want
to localize.

@{i}Step 3: @{ui}

Let's go to the 'settings'. Set the name, the version, the
revision and the language of the catalog. You must type any
characters because you won't be able to create the catalog.

@{i}Step 4: @{ui}

If you ready you have to 'Save' the files. The program creates
the catalog description (<sourcename>.cd), the catalog
translation (<sourcename>.ct), the @{"PowerD" link powerd} module to include
(<sourcename>_l.m), the new localized source (<sourcename>_l.d)
and the a D-Loc (<sourcename>.dlp) project file, where
<sourcename> is the name of the original file without extension.

@{i}Step 5: @{ui}

    You have to add some lines to your localized code. You have add
some modules and lines to your code like this:

...

MODULE '*<sourcename>_l.m','locale','libraries/locale'
...

DEF catalog:PTR TO Catalog,LocaleBase
...

PROC main()

    LocaleBase := OpenLibrary('locale.library',38)

    catalog := OpenCatalog(NIL,'<name>.catalog',OC_BuiltInLanguage,'english',OC_Version,<version>,TAG_DONE)
    ...

    CloseCatalog(catalog)

    CloseLibrary(LocaleBase)

@{i}Last step: @{ui}

    Compile the program. Don't forget to create the catalog file with
FlexCat or any other catalog handler program!

@node amigae " AmigaE"

@{b}AmigaE
******@{ub}

From version 1.1 the program supports AmigaE sources. The @{"usage" link usage}
is nearly the same as PowerD, but some files saved with different
name. If you want to use AmigaE like formats select the checkmark
named 'Save files in AmigaE format'.

PowerD       |  AmigaE
----------------------------
<name>.cd    |  <name>.cd
<name>.ct    |  <name>.ct
