What is mathterm:
-----------------

Mathterm is an OBJECT for Amiga-E that allows computing terms as
'sin(x)+pi/2' at runtime, i. e. all you have to do is, to supply
the engine with a string as given above and then start computing
it. Furthermore you may declare any number of variables and own
functions.


Installation:
-------------

Simply copy all files of drawer emodules into your module-path
of Amiga-E. I've placed them into EMODULES:tools/ so the
demo-programs and modules temselfes rely on finding the right
*.m-files there when you want to recompile some sources.
