 Hi E mailinglist

 I adapted some 'old' code from Barry Wills to the newest AmigaE version.

                                   ---------

 This demo translated by Barry Wills from the original Triton demo source,
 demo.c, the program description of which follows:

   Triton - The object oriented GUI creation system for the Amiga
   Written by Stefan Zeiger in 1993-1994

   (c) 1993-1994 by Stefan Zeiger
   You are hereby allowed to use this source or parts
   of it for creating programs for AmigaOS which use the
   Triton GUI creation system. All other rights reserved.

                                  ---------

 Things I JOrgen 'Da' Larsen have done to the source from Barry Wills

  * Replaced Mac2e macros with real AmigaE3.1a defines
  * Fixed bug with the menu 'Project/help'
  * Included defs_all
  * Moved modules (*.m) to modules/
  * Compiled with EC3.1a

 Remember that the above things are small things the real hard work was
 done by Barry Wills ( ;-> The E smily ) and Stefan Zeiger.
