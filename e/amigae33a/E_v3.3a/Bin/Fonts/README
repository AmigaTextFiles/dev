These fonts were especially designed to make E sources look good :-),
E/11 (and ELSE/11, the proportional version) were designed for non-interlaced
resolutions on 1084-type (fuzzy) monitors.
end/10 and 11 (monospaced) and except/12 and 13 (proportional) were designed
for square-pixel resolutions (such as DBLPAL) on a multisync/VGA type
monitor. Sizes 10 and 12 are relatively thin.
