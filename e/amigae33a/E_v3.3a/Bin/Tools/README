Here you'll find the distributions/docs of currently only
Aprof (a profiler), and the docs for Explorer (an object browser)
and EFindHit (an enforcer tool). Mac2E has been removed due to the
new internal macro-preprocessor in E v3.1a, EE is not being updated
anymore, and the EYacc stuff has moved to the Src/Lang directory.
