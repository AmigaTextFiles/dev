AProf has been included in the Amiga E distribution with the
approval of the author, Michael G. Binz. Thanks Michael!

[the AProf executable itself can be found in the bin directory]

usage of AProf with Amiga E is dead simple:

compile your source (say, 'bla.e') with the '-s' switch (SYM/S)
(= add symbols):

1> ec sym bla

as you can check with ShowHunk, bla now has a symbolhunk
added to it. Now, load 'bla' into AProf:

1> aprof bla

if everything went ok, you'll be seeing a GUI with some
buttons. You'll probably want to toggle 'inclusive subroutines'
off. now start the profile by pressing 'Start'. After your
program has finished, you'll see the amount of time spend
in each PROC. Especially the 'Average' column is interesting.
This will give you a clue which part of your program needs
optimising.

notes:
- as you might have noticed, E system functions CAN be profiled
  seperatedly, but library calls CANNOT, i.e. the'll always
  be added to the PROC that calls them. Be aware of this.
- AProf is not always reliable when the executation time
  of the whole program is very short.
