This directory contains 'E.guide', the original documentation written by me,
and 'beginner.guide', an excellent introduction to E by Jason Hulance.  Both
are supplied in amigaguide format, if you wish to read them in plain ascii
instead, use Jason's own Ag2Txt utility that I included (in Bin/ and
Src/Utils/Ag2Txt/), for example:

1> bin/ag2txt >docs/e.txt docs/e.guide
