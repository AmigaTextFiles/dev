These are some examples of what can be done with the modules in frumSPlugs.
I have included 3 small brushes from MagicWB to try with IffBackDrop and
IffBitMap.  (Note: these programs require iff.library.)

Try out TestPlugins.  This was made to be run on a MagicWB screen, but it
also isn't bad on a 4 colour screen.  It shows all the plugins together.

For making bitmap data for the plugins that use images, I have included
BrushToE, which takes an ilbm brush and converts it to E INT statements.
(One for each bitplane.)  If you include this output in your code, always
remember to copy it into chip ram before you use it!


  The examples are:

TestPlugins.e - All the plugins at the same time.  Shows the gauge and
                the busybox in action when you click the imagebutton.

BusyBoxExample.e - Example of how to use the busybox.

GaugeTest.e - Example of how to use the gauge.

IffBackDrop.e - Loads an ILBM brush and puts it in the background of the
                window.  Requires iff.library.

IffBitMap.e - Same thing as IffBackDrop.e, but puts it in a square instead
              of the background.

ImageButtonTest.e - Put a solid colour square in a button and shows when
                    you click on it.  The square is actually a intuition
                    image, I was just too lazy to make some actual bitmaps
                    for it.

ImageTest.e - Puts a square filled with a bitmap pointing at random memory
              in the GUI.  Again, I was just too lazy to make it some proper
              imagery.

TextPanelTest.e - Opens a window with a panel full of text demonstrating the
                  text panel's extensive features.

AslPopupsExample.e - Opens a window with 2 string gadgets and a text display
                     gadget.  The three buttons beside them are popups from
                     frumSPlugs.

BrushToE.e - This is very useful for making bitmap data for ImageButtons and
             Images.  Just give it a file name, and presto, you have your
             bitmap data.  You have to redirect the cli output to a file.

ClrWhlGrdSldTest.e - Opens a 256 colour screen (tries to detect non-AGA and
                     open a 32 colour one), and puts the colorwheel and
                     gradientslider in it.
