Installing PortablE
+++++++++++++++++++
PortablE comes with a basic installer:

* For Windows, double-click "Install_Windows.bat".
  ALTERNATIVELY, right-click on "Install_Windows.exe" and choose "Run as administrator".
  (It might work without running as an administrator, but there are less likely
  to be any problems.)

* For Linux (64-bit x86 only), open a terminal, cd to the PortablE folder, and then run:
  ./Install_Linux
  (It should already be marked as executable but if not then run: chmod +x Install_Linux)

* For AmigaOS3, double-click "Install_AmigaOS3".

* For AmigaOS4, double-click "Install_AmigaOS4".

* For AROS, double-click "Install_AROS".

* For MorphOS, double-click "Install_MorphOS".

Installing GCC
++++++++++++++
For Windows, PEGCC requires that MinGW or AmiDevCpp is installed (at the default
location).  You can download the MinGW installer here:
  https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/
And view installation instructions here:

PLEASE ENSURE that during installation you tick the options "A Basic MinGW Installation" 
and "The GNU C++ Compiler".

Note there are more recent versions of MinGW below, BUT they are untested:

Manually installing PortablE
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you run into any problems with the installer, it may be useful to know how to
install it manually...

Windows
-------
1. Copy the files in Executables\Windows to a folder that is in your command
path.  The folder "C:\Windows\System32" is almost guaranteed to be in your
command path.  But if you choose another folder (say "C:\PortablE\bin"), then 
you can TEMPORARILY add it to the command path by typing this at a Command 
prompt:
  PATH %path%;C:\MYFOLDER

If you feel confident (and have a backup of your computer), then you can
permanently add it by:  Right-clicking on (This) Computer, and selecting
Properties.  Click on "Advanced system settings".  Now click "Environmental
Variables", and under "System variables" Edit the "Path" variable.  Click "New", 
enter C:\MYFOLDER then click OK and OK.

2. Copy the PEmodules folder somewhere, I suggest C:\PortablE\PEmodules
If you are updating an existing installation, then simply overwrite the existing
files.

3. If this is your first installation, then you need to assign PEmodules:  to
C:\PortablE\PEmodules or whatever folder you chose.  This is done by using 
Notepad to create the file Assignments.txt in your USER'S main folder OR else in 
C:\PortablE, and writing the following line:

PEmodules: C:\PortablE\PEmodules

4. Finally copy the Docs & Examples folders somewhere.  Perhaps into the
C:\PortablE folder?
