Installing PortablE
+++++++++++++++++++
PortablE comes with a basic installer:

* For Windows, double-click "Install_Windows.bat".
  ALTERNATIVELY, right-click on "Install_Windows.exe" and choose "Run as administrator".
  (It might work without running as an administrator, but there are less likely
  to be any problems.)

* For Linux (64-bit x86 only), open a terminal, cd to the PortablE folder, and then run:
  ./Install_Linux
  (It should already be marked as executable but if not then run: chmod +x Install_Linux)

* For AmigaOS3, double-click "Install_AmigaOS3".

* For AmigaOS4, double-click "Install_AmigaOS4".

* For AROS, double-click "Install_AROS".

* For MorphOS, double-click "Install_MorphOS".

Installing GCC
++++++++++++++
For Amiga, PEGCC requires that G++ is installed.

* AmigaOS4 users should install SDK v53.34 (94MB) or v54.16 (346MB), which can be found here:
  http://hyperion-entertainment.biz/index.php/downloads?view=files&parent=30
  
  If you have any problems using PEGCC, then please check that you installed 
  SDK v54.16 or v53.34, as any other version is unlikely to work.

* AROS users should ensure they install GCC along with AROS.  Icaros Desktop
  Live (NOT Light!) has the option of installing GCC.

  If you have any problems, then try using Icaros Desktop Live v2.3, as that
  is what PortablE was tested with.

* MorphOS users should install the MorphOS Software Development Kit, which is
  available from here:
  http://www.morphos-team.net/downloads
  
  If you have any problems using PEGCC, then try installing the MorphOS 3.16 SDK
  (20220309), as that is what PortablE was tested with.

* AmigaOS3 users should install Geek Gadgets.  Installation is a bit fiddly, but you can find it here:
  http://aminet.net/search?path[]=dev/gg&readme=ftp.ninemoons.com%3Apub%2Fade
  http://aminet.net/dev/gg/0README-GG.txt
  
  A slightly more recent version USED to be hosted here, but the site is now down:
  https://web.archive.org/web/20131016084207/http://geekgadgets.back2roots.org/
  
  (Alternatively you could use AmiDevCpp on Windows to compile the C++ code
  generated by PortablE.)


Manually installing PortablE
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you run into any problems with the installer, it may be useful to know how to
install it manually...

Amiga (OS3, OS4, AROS & MorphOS)
-----
1. Copy the files in the relevant Executables folder to somewhere that is in
your Shell's command path.  I suggest Sys:C .

Obviously Executables\AmigaOS3 is for AmigaOS3, Executables\AmigaOS4 is for
AmigaOS4, Executables\AROS is for AROS, and Executables\MorphOS is for MorphOS.

2. Copy the PEmodules folder somewhere, I suggest Work:PEmodules
If you are updating an existing installation, then simply overwrite the existing
files.

3. If this is your first installation, then you need to assign PEmodules: to
Work:PEmodules or whatever folder you chose.  This is done by using a text
editor to add the following line to your S:User-Startup file:

Assign PEmodules: Work:PEmodules

4. Copy the Docs & Examples folders somewhere.  Perhaps into a dedicated
Work:PortablE folder?

5. From the "useful_C_stuff" folder, you should run the relevant "GCC_includes_*_INSTALL" 
script to ensure all necessary GCC files are installed.

6. If you have an old AmigaE installation, then you might like to copy the
source code for any favourite modules from Emodules: to PEmodules:.
