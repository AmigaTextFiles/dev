The GCC_includes_#?.lha archives contain C headers for *3rd-party* libraries
like MUI & ReqTools.  These are the headers I have used successfully with
PortablE, and I am providing them for your convenience.  They are not required
for more basic programs, but are recommended anyway.

The AmiDevCpp_MOS_Fixed_Datatypes_sound.zip archive contains an updated file for
AmiDevCpp, which you may find you need when compiling stuff which loads sounds.
It must be manually installed.  When you unpack it, you should get a
CrossCompiler folder.  Copy this over your existing CrossCompiler folder, which
is typically on the C drive.  Say yes to overwriting any existing file/folder.
