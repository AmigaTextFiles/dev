Installing PortablE
+++++++++++++++++++
PortablE comes with a basic installer:

* For Windows, double-click "Install_Windows.bat".
  ALTERNATIVELY, right-click on "Install_Windows.exe" and choose "Run as administrator".
  (It might work without running as an administrator, but there are less likely
  to be any problems.)

* For Linux (64-bit x86 only), open a terminal, cd to the PortablE folder, and then run:
  ./Install_Linux
  (It should already be marked as executable but if not then run: chmod +x Install_Linux)

* For AmigaOS3, double-click "Install_AmigaOS3".

* For AmigaOS4, double-click "Install_AmigaOS4".

* For AROS, double-click "Install_AROS".

* For MorphOS, double-click "Install_MorphOS".


Manually installing PortablE
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
If you run into any problems with the installer, it may be useful to know how to
install it manually...

Linux
-----
1. Copy the files in Executables/Linux to a folder that is in your command
path.  The folder "/usr/bin" is almost guaranteed to be in your command path.  
But if you choose another folder (say ~/.local/bin), then you can TEMPORARILY 
add it to the command path by typing this at a Command prompt:
  export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH

You can make this change permanent by editing ~/.bashrc and adding that line to 
the bottom of it.  You will need to open a new terminal for this to take effect.

2. Copy the PEmodules folder somewhere, I suggest ~/.portable/PEmodules
If you are updating an existing installation, then simply overwrite the existing
files.

3. If this is your first installation, then you need to assign PEmodules: to
~/.portable/PEmodules or whatever folder you chose.  This is done by using a 
text edtior to create the file ~/.portable/Assignments.txt , and writing the 
following line:

PEmodules: HOME:/.portable/PEmodules

Do NOT use ~ but instead HOME: as shown above.

4. Finally copy the Docs & Examples folders somewhere.  Perhaps into a 
new ~/Documents/PortablE folder?
