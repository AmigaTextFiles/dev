This is three modules that can be quite useful for you who program in
Amiga-E. The modules lies in the drawers that they are supposed to be in
in the 'Emodules:'-assignment.


(snip)


The third one; StringEdit.m is used for easely mess with strings.
Try 'teststring.e'!

Syntax:  e-list,numberofstrings:=splitStr(s,w=2)
e-list=an e-list with the result-strings from 's'
s=the string that you want to extract words from or packages with words
  within " "-characters.
w=number of words to extract. Words within " " is "one word". Default=2
Max is 1000 !  e-list will contain "numberofstrings" strings.

This module is very useful if you want to extract different things out
of the 'arg'-variable, ex: 'YourProgram cool 2 "Here I come!".
The 'arg' will contain 'cool 2 "Here I come"', you can split it to: 'cool' ,
'2' and '"Here I come"'.

Syntax:  str:=killMark(s)
str=result-string without marks ( " " ).
s=string with marks ( " " ) to be killed around it. 's' will also be
"mark-killed" so you can write just killMark(s).

Pass the example: '"Here I come"' to kill_mark() and you'll get:
'Here I come'!

Syntax:  str:=center(s,c,ifl)
s=string to be centered in c number of characters.
c=should be longer than StrLen(s).
ifl=if you want 'str' to be exactly c characters long in all cases. Default=0
str=result-string

Syntax:  s:=makeBin(n,b,pre)
n=the number you want in binary
b=number of bits. 1-32.  If -1 is given makeBin() will ignore all leading
zeroes. Default=-1
pre=If set, makeBin() will set a "%" first in the string. Default=1
s=the resulting string that should be deallocated if makeBin() if used
often. Use  DisposeLink(s),  same goes for center().


Module used in: Timer, TimerPrefs, DeniilCalc, MarkKiller, ModHandler etc.


I thinks that's all for now..
