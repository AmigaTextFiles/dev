cookRawkey.m - Module of functions designed to process a raw input event,
translating it into its corresponding Vanilla keycode as defined by the
current keymap.  Uses the console.device.

    warmupRawkeyCooker()

Initializes the module to enable processing of raw input events.  Should be
called once prior to invoking any of the other functions in the module.
May raise any of the following exceptions:  "MEM", ER_CREATEPORT,
ER_CREATEIO, ER_OPENDEVICE, ER_ASKKEYMAP.

    ascii_keycode:=cookRawkey(message.code, message.qualifier, message.iaddress)

ascii_keycode gets the Vanilla ASCII value if one exists, else 0.  message is
here a PTR TO intuimessage, which contains the address of an IDCMP_RAWKEY
message.  Vanilla ASCII codes may be manufactured by passing in a valid raw
code and a valid raw qualifier, and a valid PTR TO LONG which points to
deadkey prefixes (or zeroized memory if deadkeys aren't desired, i.e.,
[0]:LONG) for the iaddress.

    shutdownRawkeyCooker()

Cleans up the module.  Should be called once when the module's functions are
no longer needed.  Raises no exceptions.  Performs complete sanity checks,
and may therefore be safely called multiple times.


NOTES:

It is entirely possible that this module will successfully translate any
kind of raw input event properly, although this has not been tested. :-)

You may repeatedly warmup and shutdown the rawkey cooker module, but you must
be careful to call shutdownRawkeyCooker() before calling warmupRawkeyCooker()
a subsequent time.  Otherwise, the allocated resources will be irreclaimable
and your system will degrade.
