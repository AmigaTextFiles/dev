Documentation
-------------

The documentation on amiga.lib serves as adequate documentation of these
functions, with the following observations:

  argarray.m:
    o   argArrayInit() takes only an optional string.  This can be a string
      of arguments like the E global "arg" (which is the default).  This
      string is only used if "wbmessage" is NIL, and is *altered* if used
      (i.e., the result is a manipulation of the string, and so by default
      "arg" will be affected).  If you don't like this, pass this function
      a copy of your arguments string (and be careful not to free it until
      you've finished with the result of this function).

  boopsi.m:
    o   callHookA() is like CallHookPkt() from utility.library except it does
      not require the utility.library to be open!
    o   setSuperAttrsA() replaces the stack-based (varargs) function
      SetSuperAttrs().  setSuperAttrsA() takes a pointer to a Boopsi message
      as its third argument (so you would usually use a typed list).

  cx.m:
    o   invertStringRev() is like InvertString() except it does not require
      you to reverse the string to be inverted.  See testcx.e.
    o   userFilter(tt, action_name, default_descr) creates a CxFilter object
      with a description string taken from the tooltype defined by
      "action_name" in the tooltypes array "tt" (which is usually the result
      of a call to argArrayInit()).  If the tooltype is not found then the
      "default_descr" is used instead.

  interrupts.m:
    o  waitbeam(pos) waits until the VBeam position is at least "pos".

  tasks.m:
    o   createTask() can has slightly enhanced error checking if you are
      running V37+.

The main reason for the creation of these modules was my translations of the
RKRM examples.  These should provide even more useful documentation.
