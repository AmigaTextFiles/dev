This "PEmodules:CSH" folder contains my personal modules, which were needed to
implement some of the "std" modules.  I am making these "CSH" modules available
for others to use, since they may be useful.  However, UNlike the "std" modules:

1. I make no guarantees they won't change in incompatible ways in the future.
So if you use "CSH" modules, beware that future releases of PortablE may require
you to make changes to your program to make them compile/work again.  (Also you
may wish to make backup copies of any CSH modules that you use.)

2. These modules are not documented, however feel free to ask me about them
(preferably on the official PortablE forum) and I'll do my best to answer your
questions.
