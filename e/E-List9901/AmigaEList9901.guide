  Here you'll find all the messages appeared on Amiga E Mailing list
  in January 1999.

  This is the first version of the message log done in Amiga Guide.

  I have just written a little program to do this, as soon as I can
  create some comments, I'll release it in the public domain.

  The best way of reading this guide is to choose an argument

Are you doing this several times?
Then you will always copy the string into Address mystr, which will
be inserted for every listitem, so all items will contain the same text.

Set MUIA_List_ConstructHook, MUIV_List_ConstructHook_String
and MUIA_List_DestructHook, MUIV_List_DestructHook_String
for this list to avoid this.

Now, X always points to another memory location, while mystr is always
the same memory location.

I tested this, and now everything works as it should.:-)
I kind of thought this was default settings, but
obviously not.
This probably fixes Mr.Torchia's problem as well.

Exactly the problem I've been having...

AP> StrCopy(mystr,'Hello')
AP> doMethodA(mygad,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,mystr,MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom])

AP> DEF x
AP> X:='Hello'
AP> doMethodA(mygad,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,x,MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom])

That is what I had discovered, and it was driving my crazy. BUT...

..I think I found my problem (and yours too).  After extensively reading the
MUI autodocs on lists and listview (guess I should have done this before,
but I figured just skimming them was good enough, and was until now), I
stumbled onto a comment in the area
talking about construct hooks, stating:

    There is a builtin construct hook available called
    MUIV_List_ConstructHook_String. This expects that
    you only add strings to your list and will make
    a local copy of this string to allow you destroying
    the original. Of course you *must* also use
    MUIV_List_DestructHook_String in this case.

This is the only mention of it, and there sure was no other explaination on
how to use it.  So I did a search of all the MUI source code (both C and E)
for "MUIV_List_ConstructHook_String" that I have on my HD.  Well, the
program AppWindow.c had it.  It is used as such:

            ListObject,
                ReadListFrame,
                MUIA_List_ConstructHook, MUIV_List_ConstructHook_String,
                MUIA_List_DestructHook , MUIV_List_DestructHook_String ,
                End,
            End

Doing the same with my E program cured the problem!  Using my own hooks
I couldn't make it work, but using the builtin MUI string hooks works
perfectly in adding my own strings to the listviews! Still can't figure
out why my way doesn't work though....

Hi Carl!
On 31-Gru-98 you generated such output:
>> DEF mystr[10]:STRING
>> StrCopy(mystr,'Hello')
>>
doMethodA(mygad,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,mystr,MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom])

>> ...but...

>> X:='Hello'
>> doMethodA(mygad,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,x,MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom])

>> ...works fine.

> There shouldn't be any difference..

But there is. I assume that the code above is a part of a procedure
responsible for adding a node to a listview. The problem with the
first method is that mystr is a *local* variable and it is *disposed*
on exit from this procedure. Change this to:

DEF mystr:PTR TO CHAR
mystr:=String(10)
StrCopy(mystr,'Hello')
doMethodA(mygad,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,mystr,MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom])

And this will work.

Bye!

Hi!

> It seems like MUI-listviews does not like E-strings.

No, that's not the problem.

> Every time I try to use an E-string in a
> listview, I get strange results. Initialy everything looks fine,

> strange things start happening.

That is, because initialy (immediately after inserting) the string
still exists, but later (when MUI needs it again to redraw it) the
string is disposed (see below).

> Like this...
>
> DEF mystr[10]:STRING
> StrCopy(mystr,'Hello')
> doMethodA(mygad,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,mystr,MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom])

In this case, mystr is a pointer to some memory which is large enough
to contain up to 10 characters. This memory (the STRING) is local to
the function and is therefore allocated on the stack. And as soon as
the function ends, the memeory (the STRING) is disposed!

By inserting the string into the list, you only insert the pointer to
the string into the list. A pointer that points to a string which
exists only as long as the function runs! By default MUI does not
copy the string itself, but only the pointer. You have to tell MUI
to create a copy of the string with:

     MUIA_List_ConstructHook, MUIV_List_ConstructHook_String,
     MUIA_List_DestructHook,  MUIV_List_DestructHook_String

> ...but..
>

Yes, because in this case the string is a constant string which is
part of the program. Therefore it is not disposed at the end of
the function!

Hi!

I'm trying to speed up a mathprogram. But how do you use
floats in asm? How should I translate this:

c:=!a-b

And this?

b:=!a*2!

Thanks in advance! And happy new year!!!

As EC does not support FPU ASM, you have to use an external assembler.
Write a xx.asm file, assemble it to xx.o, use o2m and use the module.
Beware that EC pushes arguments from left to right.

bla_iii:
=09fmove.s a(a7),fp0
=09fsub.s b(a7),fp0
=09fmove.s fp0,([c_ptr,a7])
=09rts

The second statement: you are trying to multiply a floating point number
with a integer constant!

=09fmove.s a(a7),fp0
=09fadd.s fp0,fp0
=09fmove.l fp,([b_ptr,a7])
=09rts

Kind regards,

Thanks for your answer!!

Which assembler do you recommend? None of those I have understood
the code above.

I use PhxAss, available on Aminet. It is necessary to use an 'fpu'
directive.

A pointer contains no memory, it is just that, it points to a memory
location, unless you say it specifically has memory, then it just
points to some random (usually $000000, unless mungwall used) memory
address.

DEF ng:newgadget

is a pointer that points to a fixed area of memory.
accessing ng.width is perfectly legal as it has some memory to store
the values in.

DEF ng:PTR TO newgadget

is just a pointer, it has no memory.
so, ng.width is illegal, as you are accessing memory which may be in
use by other programs, to get some meory for ng you can do this:

NEW ng

- -OR-

ng:=New(SIZEOF newgadget)

which assign some memory, and stick the pointer to this memory into ng

pointers are immensly useful, bu v. difficult to learn, persevere, they
are worth the effort.

mungwall writes rubbish over all of your memory, hence if you define a
pointer it will point to stupid values, (e.g. $DEADBEEF is a good one).
This allows enforcer to pick up hits easier. If you continually run
your program, AmigaOS will keep giving you the same area of memory, and
the same values, hence bugs such as the above may remain hidden, as all
of your address are valid, but as soon as you reset, or try the program
on another computer, KERPOW!!!

Anytime, it wasn`t long ago I was grasping with pointers, they`re v.

@node ID4_0 "Extracting e-strings from a filehandle (ID4_0)"

Subject: Extracting e-strings from a filehandle

Hi,

I'm in the process of writing a weapons editor for MicroProse's brilliant
(but aged) game "X-COM: UFO-defense/UFO: Enemy Unknown". This boils down to
editing a file called "OBDATA.DAT" which (briefly outlined) has the
following format:

OBJECT weapon
    name[20]:ARRAY        ->Offset 00
    damage:CHAR            ->Offset 16
    ammo1:CHAR            ->Offset 1A
    ...And so on...
    ammords:CHAR        ->Offset 26
ENDOBJECT

Which is to say that every object (weapon) occupies 54 bytes, whereas the
first 20 are reserved for the object's name. Now, the problem is that when
reading the value of the NAME from the filehandle, I have resorted to this
rather "bulky" procedure:

PROC readobvalues(y) OF weapon
    FOR x:=0 TO 19
        self.name[x]:=m[x+y]
    ENDFOR
    self.damage:=m[y+22]
    ...And so on...
ENDPROC

Where y is the position of the object section within the filehandle (like
Filehandle[y], since the whole file really is loaded into memory as one
looong STRING or
ARRAY OF CHAR). The problem is the FOR - TO loop that is used to read the
name, while it works fine as it stands, it keeps nagging me that there
simply _has_ to be an easier way to do this...

Additionally, do anybody have any suggestions on how to put all these
strings (the whole file contains 80 objects) into a listview using EasyGUI?

And - a bit on the side - has anybody heard of an Amiga version of X-COM II?

This is how I`d have done it, also, your probably better off using
nodemaster for something like this :) to maintain you list of weapon(s)

PROC readobvalues(y) OF weapon
     DEF tempstring[20]:ARRAY OF CHAR, namemem:PTR TO CHAR

     namemem:=NewR(20)
     FOR x:=0 TO 19
         tempstring[x]:=m[x+y]
     ENDFOR
     StringF(namemem, tempstring)

     self.name:=namemem
     self.damage:=m[y+22]
     ...And so on...
ENDPROC

Okay, so it actually looks a little less elegant, but it is elegant,
honest :)

Also, define filehandle[y] as a PTR TO CHAR, and allocate your memory,
with NewR(), this is much better than sticking your data on the stack,
and also gets around the 32k limit E places on object size definitions.
once done, you can access filehandle[] in exactly the same way, just
remember to END the memory!!!

Not without loading it directly, rather than dumping it into memory,
but whatever way you want to do it, you`ll need a FOR 0 TO 20 in there
somewhere to pick out the name. Unless, name is a \0 terminated string,
in which case you can use FGetS() (from async module) to just grab the
name (You`ll probably have to remember to put it back set to size 20
mind).

Hope thats helpful!

Sorry, I cnnot understand this... if you have already loaded the ASCII
file in memory, why don't you use a CopyMem()?

CopyMem(m+y,namemem, 20)

Instead of the FOR loop.
If you declare namemem as an E-String you have just to call
SetStr(namemem, 20), no need for another copy with StringF. More
efficient and small.

Yes there's another way, that is filling the weapon object while loading
the ASCII file. If the fields have the right numbers of chars (that is if
the name is always 20 chars in size, and the same for the other fields)
you can read the right number of chars through any filehandle routines and
place them in the object. If the right number of chars is not fixed you
can use the GetFC() function. There must be a char that mark the end of a
field (be it a newline or any other ASCII char).

Hey :) I always miss the obvious ones, so rewritten it would now read:

PROC readobvalues(y) OF weapon
      DEF namemem:PTR TO CHAR

      namemem:=NewR(20)
      CopyMem(m+y,namemem, 20)
      SetStr(namemem, 20)

You can use readfile() from tools/file.m to read the file into memory.

The whole body of the PROC could be replaced by:
CopyMem(m+y,self.name,$27)

I cannot understand people who use StringF() where they should use
StrCopy().
StringF() is slower.
StringF() will give enforcerhits + stringtrash if there are any "%" in the
string and you didn't give the correct extra-arguments.
StringF() simply was never ment for copying strings!

And about CopyMem() used in another reply:
Certanly, better than anything else mentioned..
AstrCopy() is the one you *should* use. (ArrayStringCopy, I think it means).
It will ensure NULLtermination and never copy more then there is room for.
(Same as CopyMem, only it adds NULL-term if there isn't one and stops
copying if it hits NULL before len-1 chars.
AstrCopy( self.name , m+y , 20 )

This really shuldn't be called a filehandle. Of course the name isn't going
to crash anything, but a filehandle is the thing you pass to dos.library
funcytions like Read() and Write(), not an array of memory.

You really should only read one object at a time.
If I read correctly you store the objects exactly the same in file as in
memory. Just read them then!

Read( filehandle , weapon + 4 , SIZEOF weapon - 4 )

filehandle really is a filehandle, as returned by Open().
The +4 and -4 is because the first 4 bytes are used for a pointer to an
array of memberfunctions, so if this is not an OOP object you should skip
that.

I am wondering about a good way of

like this in E :

Maybe a copymemquick(myspacestring, mystring, 256)

No copymemquick can't be used as it is just as copymem and if you do not
have an already filled area to copy it is useless.

I am not an ASM programmer at all. All I have done are small routines used
to swap bytes/words, transforms ASCII cars in number and viceversa,
compression/decompression/encryption routines and few other small things.

However the above could be writenn this way, that may be furtherly
optimized, I suppose:

MOVE.L mystring, A0   (Maybe LEA mystring, A0 could be used as well)
MOVE.L #64, D0
MOVE.L #32323232, D1
loop:
MOVE.L D1, (A0)+
DBRA D0, loop

Can't remember if DBRA executes also when D0 is 0, so the initial D0 value
could be #63 instead (if #64 it too big your program may crash).

This is not good, you try to set it an 8bit value to a 16bit value.
What you'll end up with is the value 50. Remove the "".

PROC memfill( _mem , _char , _len )

  DEF mem : REG PTR TO CHAR , char : REG , len : REG
- -> E doesn't support putting args in regs..
- -> So I move them to regs here:
  mem  := _mem
  char := _char
  len  := _len

  WHILE ( len-- ) DO mem[]++ := char
  mem[] := char    -> Once more, since -- returns the RESULT.

ENDPROC

This is nicer then the other reply, because this doesn't require any
particular CPU. =) It's probablt not quite as fast, but it doesn't require
the len to be a multiple of 4.

And to the guy who wrote the asm:
#32323232 is not a hexvalue, it's the same as #$01ED36A0, which is probably
not what you intended. =)

Yeah, this is a good way!
im gonna go with something like this :

/* longwordfill */
PROC fillmeml(mem, value, len)
   DEF m:REG PTR TO LONG, v:REG, l:REG
   m:=mem
   v:=value
   l:=len + 1
   WHILE (l--) DO m[]++ := v
ENDPROC

in the case of wanna filling a string (longwordaligned!)
with the SPACEchar, ill do this :

DEF myspacestring
myspacestring:=FastNew(256) (I _think_ its lwaligned)
fillmeml(myspacestring, "    ", 64)

The /*easiest*/ way is to use the AFC module _rexxer_.  It is excellent for
setting up your own arexx interface, receiving arexx commands, and for
SENDING them to other programs.

another place is tool at the example custom classes.

if you look at the source files for the .m files you will also see all the
macros built into them.  I guess if you do a search for rp or rastport
you'll
find it!

Unless rare cases, you're only allowed to draw during the MUIM_Draw
method. During the execution of it, you can use _rp(obj) to access the
rastport.
Note that clipping is done through MUI_AddClipping/MUI_RemoveClipping
(undocumented functions, erk).

Take a look at the demos (class3.e, for example) and the cool BSpline
source code (Aminet).

  Yes; you create a RexxMsg, & send it to the program's ARexx port.  Here's
a hastily-constructed example prg :-) that will iconify YAM (sends "Hide"
to the YAM port (line #23; the rxcmdtoport() proc at line #50 does the
work).  Once the cmd is sent, you have to watch for the reply msg & dispose
of the RexxMsg you created (like in lines #30-33).

  Hope this helps!

Okey, although there is an AFC class for doing this, it is pretty
rubbish (IMHO), however I just happen to have written something
"better" ;-)

It's called ARexxComm & is *NOT* on the Aminet - I have been too busy
with RL.  If you want a copy, please mail me personally (see sig).

Hopefully it will get uploaded early February after my exams are
finished.

Now instead of "array[ index ].member" you have to write

You should consider also this:

  b
  c
ENDOBJECT

DEF array[SIZE]:ARRAY OF LONG

' To add elems to the array...

array[x]:= ptr

But this implies you allocate static memory for all your objects, and the
array is not an array of PTR but contains the objects themselves (which
have only a PTR field but are not PTR themselves). This may not be useful
in some situation (like managing a dynamic list of nodes and such). It is
better to "extract" the wanted pointer in a varaibale that is a PTR
ptr_to_whatever and then use it to access internal field of the structure
Moreover you'll have problem trying to store the pointer of the objects in
the array.

This is quite elegant, and actually have put it to use in a program I'm
working on.  This to me makes more sense.

BTW I've been studying some C source code (since there is so little E code
to use as a base to teach myself programming) and came across some like
this:

struct xyz {
  unsigned int a[16];
  char b[16][16];
  unsigned char c[16];
  unsigned char d;
};

Translating this to E, I came up with:

OBJECT a
  a :INT
ENDOBJECT

OBJECT b
  b :[16]:ARRAY OF CHAR
ENDOBJECT

OBJECT xyz
  a[16]:ARRAY OF a
  b[16]:ARRAY OF b
  c[16]:ARRAY OF CHAR
  d    :CHAR
ENDOBJECT

Is this correct? (it appears to work).  Is there a more elegant and
better method of converting that piece of C code? That array of array (I
think that is what it is) cannot be done in E, can it?

Yes it is an array of array and can be "ported" in many ways. However I

You can also make an array of an array by multiplying the two dimnesions
of the array together, and when you are indexing into the array, you
multiply the first index by the width of the array, and add the second
index to get he logical index into the array.  You coudl write a little
function or macro to support this, if you wanted.

: defensive mode ON
My mail is strictly for when you really do want an ARRAY OF PTR TO, and
doesn't state when or why you would want to.
: defensive mode OFF

But a PTR is in itself 4 bytes, just a my dummy-object. So after compilation
it's the same.

Dynamic? Nothing dynamic works with *any* kind of ARRAY, of course this is
no different.

And storing the object is no problem, really. Try it, it will work.
(Assuming of course that you do write array[ index ].ptr as I stated you
should)

HI there EList PPL,

 can anyone give me an idea of how to use the Arexx
functions of MUI?? and how to write a simple custom class (what would
the basics of writing a text editor class be). I can use the arexx
funcs but only as single commands with no args my prog just crashes
when i use args.

Hello folks!

I'm making a minor program called MrIcon,
though the NewIcon copy stuff bothers me!

When I copy the newicon, and the close the =

    But not when I copy the "normal" image,
so I suppose it's this part that contains
an error!

I guess to copy the images like I do in the

But how shall I do it? I have no idea?!

Please help!

The Example:

From: torchia@windsor.igs.net (Ralph Torchia)
Date: Mon, 18 Jan 1999 16:51:03 -0500
Subject: Library calls with E

Hello Everyone!

First I want to thank everyone on this mailing list that has helped me with
programming in E.

Well, I've got another "problem" with using some library calls from E.  I've
had no problems until now, and cannot determine what is the problem.  There
is a function call with the following synopsis:

  Length =Index(Socket,DBHandle,Index,Buffer,ID,Size,Attr,Cat);
   D0.l          A0.l    D0.l    D1.l A1.l  A2.l A3.l D2.l D3.l

  LONG Index(APTR,LONG,UWORD,APTR,ULONG *,UWORD *,UBYTE *,UBYTE *);

   Socket   -- (APTR) Socket
   DBHandle -- (LONG) Database handle
   Index    -- (UWORD) Index of the record
   Buffer   -- (APTR) Buffer for the record. The buffer must have
                a sufficient size of 65535 byte.
   ID       -- (ULONG *) If a pointer is provided, the record ID
                is copied there. You may provide NULL.
   Size     -- (UWORD *) If a pointer is provided, the UWORD is
               filled with the size of this record. You may
               provide NULL.
   Attr     -- (UBYTE *) If a pointer is provided, the record
               attribute is copied there. You may provide NULL.
               Assembler users watch out: this is a pointer
               in a data register!
   Cat      -- (UBYTE *) If a pointer is provided, the record
               category is copied there. You may provide NULL.
                Assembler users watch out: this is a pointer
                in a data register!

When I call this from my program, the inputs id, size, attr, and cat remain
at zero.  My buffer is filled without problems.  Is this a bug in the API
or are those last inputs requiring some special treatment in AmigaE to get
them to be set?

It should work. The most likely cause is a faulty module I would think.
Check if ShowModule says it uses the right registers.

If not, have you given pointers correctly? "{var}" for "normal" vars where
you
want a pointer, just "var" for arrays.

As you can see ID, Size, Attr and Cat are all defined as pointer to
something (the nasty * in C means pointer to). That means you have to pass
a pointer to a variable containing your values.

Index (Socket, handle, Index, Buffer, {ID}, {Size}, {attr}, {cat})

This should work, even though the pointers are not really pointers to the
needed types. However as they are all the same, that is 4 byte long
variables, the function will deference them the right way.

Hope this will help.

Thought that is what the * was in C, and originally I had my code to pass a
pointer to the variables, just like your example.  I tried it again, just
to make sure, and it didn't work.  I do get some nice Byte-Read Enforcer
hits though... :-(

I've been skimming through the AmigaE guide for some answers, besides maybe
the API is the problem.  I've read about EC using the registers A4/A5.
Does it use other registers that maybe are causing problems with the
library I'm trying to use?

No. It will copy a char (or an int) to the given adress. This is the MSB of
the LONG. You would have to do a Shr( value , 24 ) to get the real value,
and even that might not work right, because I seem to remember something
about Shr() behaving strangely with signed numbers..

{variable} + SIZEOF LONG - SIZEOF datatype
would be rigth. CHAR and INT are the tho datatypes used. And variable has to
be 0 before the function call.

Might be simpler to use very small arrays. =)
DEF size[ 1 ] : ARRAY OF INT , attr[ 1 ] : ARRAY OF CHAR ,
    cat[ 1 ] : ARRAY OF CHAR
since ID is a LONG it can be passed with {} without any wierdlooking adding.
And then of course size[] and attr[] etc when you want to read the values.

    At the mo it`s just a GUI but the section storage is in place hopefully
so you can switch sections with tabs and it should remember the list, so it

    It can be found at www.nelson54.freeserve.co.uk  in coding / AmigaE

; ) ).  The archive is only 23Kb.

    The only bug I`ve found is it doesn`t like having topaz as the

Reading through the AmigaE guide I see that the compiler sets its own stack,

I've also heard that it does it in a naughty way, and could cause problems.

If so, how do you overcome it, and take control of the stack?  (I've found a

The "taking control of the stack" is the whole naughty problem.  This is

Too late, run into it with some software ;-).   Also, in using NList I
rather take a different route than using fakestack.

Is there a system friendly way of not letting EC control the stack?

E will *allways* replace your stack. Even if the system stack is larger
than the stack E allocates..

The only thing you can do is make it system friendly.

PROC fixstack()
  DEF task : PTR TO tc , sp

  task := FindTask( NIL )
  MOVE.L A7,sp
  task.spupper := sp
  task.splower := sp - FreeStack()

ENDPROC

This will still leave task.spupper incorrect, but that shouldn't be a
problem, the stack just looks slightly smaller than it is.
You could add an aproximation of used stack to the value. If you have used
the OPT STACK=X then you can use
  task.spupper := sp + X - FreeStack()
or you can just guess. =)  16 bytes is used when this funktion is called,
all global DEFs are allready on the stack, and all DEFs in main(), and also
a little more. =)

Cool works great exept now, how do i do say, if name = 'james'
then do something ? I've tryed various ways, but to no avail,
so do you have any ideas ? I thought,

IF entryptr.name = 'James'
        PrintF('James')
ENDIF

But this done'nt work, so do you have any ideas ??

If you do so, you compare the address pointers of the two strings,
and these are different, of course.

To compare the two strings, try

 IF StrCmp(entryptr.name , 'James')
        PrintF('James')
 ENDIF

        Hi All,

        I'm new on this list, but I'm going to cut the introduction

  Polynomials over GF(2) are represented in binary, one bit per coefficient,
  with the lowest powers in the most significant bit.  Then adding
polynomials
  is just exclusive-or, and multiplying a polynomial by x is a right shift
by
  one.  If we call the above polynomial p, and represent a byte as the
  polynomial q, also with the lowest power in the most significant bit (so
the
  byte 0xb1 is the polynomial x^7+x^3+x+1), then the CRC is (q*x^32) mod p,
  where a mod b means the remainder after dividing a by b.

  This calculation is done using the shift-register method of multiplying
and
  taking the remainder.  The register is initialized to zero, and for each
  incoming bit, x^32 is added mod p to the register if the bit is a one
(where
  x^32 mod p is p+x^32 = x^26+...+1), and the register is multiplied mod p
by
  x (which is shifting right by one and adding x^32 mod p if the bit shifted
  out is a one).  We start with the highest power (least significant bit) of
  q and repeat for all eight bits of q.

  The table is simply the CRC of all possible eight bit values.  This is all
  the information needed to generate CRC's on data a byte at a time for all
  combinations of CRC register values and incoming bytes.

Here's the module to calculate a crc 32 bit checksum. You should
 notice that the crc table is static and not dynamic. It doesn't cost
 much mem but creation of a dynamic table would cost additional code
 and there is no real advantage of using dynamic tables.
 The routine of this module is called:

    crc32( crc_initial, crc_buffer, crc_len )

 When crc_buffer is NIL, the initial value for crc calculation is
 returned. The parameter crc_initial is useful for those who needs
 to calculate the crc checksum stepwise (f.e. large files which
 doesn't fit into memory). Have fun 8-)

@node ID28_0 "RAMIGA Qualifier (ID28_0)"
From: chris@planb.thegap.com (Christopher Perver)
Date: Mon, 25 Jan 1999 16:24:29 +0000
Subject: RAMIGA Qualifier

   Hello list :)

I am writing a clipboard copying feature into *EvenMore* and
I want to copy to the clipboard using 'RAMIGA c'.

If I am right, the qualifier name for RAMIGA is IEQUALIFIER_RCOMMAND? But I
can't get it to recognise the
qualifier, it just thinks I have pressed C on its own, and
as a result closes the file, as I have set up EvenMore to close
the file when I press C on its own.

I know it is not anything else that is causing the problem
as I just tested it using 'RSHIFT c' and it works nicely.

Can anyone help me with this? Thanks.

     Chris.

cause they are easier to miss and overlook.

My baddest bug of this kind, to date, was a syntax error in which a
compiler was returning the bad line number on a line in which I had
replaced zero (0) by the UpperCase Letter 'O'  it happened that in the
font I was using, they had the Exact same visual appearance... (I
finally started looking at character codes of each letter (in CED) to
see if there where no 'invisible' chars in the editor...  Then When I
changed the Font it became OBVIOUS!

Just some bits of talking...  ;)

Hello All,

Right fisrt of all thnx for all your help so far :) Now I have some
more questions to ask :)

First of all for my Nlist I have data : name, surname, age,
difined as n, s, a. How can i attach extra data that is not
interted into a nlist, but can be called apon, the example i
have to pull the data is,

IF getx(nlist, MUIA_NList_Active)<>-1
doMethodA(nlist, [MUIM_NList_GetEntry, MUIV_NList_GetEntry_Active,
{entryptr}, 0])
Mui_RequestA(ap_bb,win,0,'Message','Ok','Selected entry is:\n\n%s, %s, Age:
%s', [entryptr.name, entryptr.surname, entryptr.age,0])

And the names ect look like this,

n:='Jim'
s:='Bob'
a:='53'
new:=[n, s, a]:oListData

So how could i create a say p or phono, that coudl be read my the entryptr.

Currenlty i use this to intert entries into the nlist (this is mui i'm
talking bout btw)

   n:='Wayne'
   s:='Redmore'
   a:='27'
   new:=[n, s, a]:oListData
   domethod(nlist, [MUIM_NList_InsertSingle, new, MUIV_NList_Insert_Sorted])

   n:='Jim'
   s:='Bob'
   a:='53'
   new:=[n, s, a]:oListData
   domethod(nlist, [MUIM_NList_InsertSingle, new, MUIV_NList_Insert_Sorted])

etc....

Is there a faster, and better way to do this, as it does seem there is a
better way to do this....

Lastly, i did a test nlist and filled it with 40 entires and it
took bout 600k of fastmem, this is not a problem to me as i have
32meg fast ram, but it coull be for some users, who are a buit
short on fast mem, so its it my beginerish programming, and
is there a way to make it use less, or is it what's to be expected.

Attached is source for you to look at....

Yours

Subject: Reading/writing IFF files

   Hello everyone,

I am thinking about making an IFF preference file and I
had a look at some preference files of other programs
and noticed most seem to have the chunks PREF and PRHD
at the beginning. Is this a standard way of writing a
preference file, and if so what is the PRHD chunk for?

Also, I need to save a few ARRAYs of INT to the file.
Before I just converted them to strings and when I read
them again, converted them back. How could I read and
write the data in the ARRAY as it is?

Thanks

PReferences HEader, IIRC. A very general chunk that specifies things like
prefs
file version. See the module emodules/prefs/prefhdr.m!

DEF myarray[20]:ARRAY OF INT, len = 20 * SIZEOF INT, buf

...

Write(fh, {len}, 4)
Write(fh, myarray, len)

IF buf = "ARAY" THEN
  Read(fh, {len}, 4)
  Read(fh, myarray, len)
ENDIF

Or of course you could use iffparse.library if you are storing more complex
data structures. Personally, if you are only storing a few numbers, then it
is IMHO better just to use an ASCII text file and do conversions - that way
the user can look at the numbers and edit them by hand, or run a prefs
editor
if one is available.

Thanks this works nicely.

Hmm. I think I may just stick to a standard file for now, and if I manage
to work out how to put my prefs in an OBJECT (I can do it, but all that
object
typing takes up a lot of bytes when I refer to each setting in the
program),
I may use an IFF file instead.

Thanks!

I see a big problem with this:

Global variables don't work well at all this way. *This includes
library-bases*! exec, dos, gfx and intuition are allways on the same offset
(from A4), but all others are but wherever EC likes depending on wich ones
you use.

So you can't use any other libs than those, and no global vars.

Something like this:

Have a look in the autodocs for the graphics.library. There exist one
routine do just this, what you want.
ReadPixel or something but maybe you should use
ReadPixelArray and work on a chunky representation?

I don't have any autodocs, so can you send them to me as an e-mail attach
or are these copyright material? I'm not very experienced in graphics
progarmmin
so could you also explain how and why should I use that chunky mode? And do

then have to use some sort of an c2p routine?

Yes, they are copyright by AT and available at the DeveloperCD 1.2 as
AmigaGuide file, I belive. Do you try to program the system without any
documentation?

I supose, you want to read a lot of pixels? This is quite slow on native
Amiga screens. I dont know exactly what you want to do, but if you want to
read a lot of pixels, then better you make ReadPixelArray() to get a array
with all the pixel values and if you want to write a lot of pixels, then
it is better you use c2p, like WritePixelArray(), but this is a slow
variant of c2p.
but try it first with ReadPixel() an WritePixel()

BTW: have a look at:

Oh, that's why all the demoes use c2p. :)

Have I understood right the usage of it:

pixval:=ReadPixel(screen-rastport,x,y)

And what module should I use? Atleast I didn't find ReadPixel from any of
the modules that came with E distribution. Or if possible, could give me a
small example of how to use this?

Hey!

I've been using ECDEMO v3.2 for about a couple of weeks by now, and as I

However, the registration guide that came with v3.2 is very old, and
Wouter's E page hasn't been updated in ages. I'm not rich enough to send a
registration fee to someone else ;.), so I'd just like to know what
Wouter's address is now, if it has changed at all -- and whether it's
possible to receive the 3.3 archive per disk instead of email, since I'm
on the net through a lousy wintel PC.
