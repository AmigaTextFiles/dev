Password PLUGIN
---------------
Makes a rudimentary password entry gadget.  Uses a standard GadTools string
gadget so you need to specify TRUE for the optional `isgt' field of the
PLUGIN gadget to use it (otherwise you get a black rectangle!).

Constructors:

    password(estr,label=NIL,over=FALSE,relx=0,disabled=FALSE)
        estr     -> The initial password (must be an E-string)
        label    -> The label for the gadget
        over     -> Whether the string gadget is in overwrite mode
        relx     -> Relative width (default is 5)
        disabled -> Whether this gadget is disabled

Destructor:

    END *must* be called for each NEWed object.

Data (should be considered read-only):

    OBJECT password OF plugin
      estr      -> Current password
      disabled  -> Disabled or enabled
    PRIVATE ...
    ENDOBJECT

New methods:

    setpass(str)               -> Set the password to str (copied)
    setdisabled(disabled=TRUE) -> Disable/enable the gadget

Action functions:

    Your action function will be called (or your action value returned by
    easygui()) in the following circumstances:
      o When the return or tab is pressed in the gadget

    Note: unlike normal STR gadgets, the estr is *always* up-to-date.

Exceptions:

    "pass" will be raised by the constructor if the gadtools.library can't
           be opened.
    "pass" will be raised by the render() method if the gadget can't be
           created.
    "MEM"  will be raised by the constructor or setpass() method if the
           temporary string can't be created.
