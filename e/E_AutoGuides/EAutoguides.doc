IMPORTANT!!!  

In  order  to  get  this  working  you  will  need  E_AutoGuide.lha by Sven
Steiniger.   It's in the aminet/dev/e directory.  The AREXX script provided
therein is meant to be used with GoldEd.


EAutoGuide.ced
--------------
'EAutoGuide.ced'  is  an  AREXX  script  that  will  add  online  E help to
CygnusED.   Copy  it  in your REXX:  logical device, in the ced/ directory.
Attach  the  following  line  to  one  of  the  function  keys  (using  the
'Special->DOS/Arexx Interface->Install DOS/Arexx Command' menu command):

                       ced/EAutoGuide.ced doc_path  

where   doc_path  is  the  COMPLETE  path  where  you  have  put  both  the
E_AutoGuide.guide  and  the  E_Autoguide.ref files (both are to be found in
the E_AutoGuide.lha archive).

Amigaguide  will  then  display  the keyword under your cursor (or if there
wasn't one, CED will ask you for a keyword), together with all the info you
need, on a seperate CygnusEd public screen.


EAutoGuide.amis
---------------
'EAutoGuide.amis'  is  an AREXX script that will add online E help to AMIS.
Copy  it in your REXX:  logical device, in the amis/ directory.  Add a menu
item  (via  'Settings->Menu...') and allocate the following line to it (via
the 'Edit'-button):

                    REXX:amis/EAutoGuide.amis doc_path

where   doc_path  is  the  COMPLETE  path  where  you  have  put  both  the
E_AutoGuide.guide  and  the  E_Autoguide.ref files (both are to be found in
the E_AutoGuide.lha archive).

Amigaguide  will  then display the keyword under your cursor, together with
all the info you need, on a seperate AMIS public screen.


EAutoGuide.bed
---------------
'EAutoGuide.bed'  is an AREXX script that will add online E help to BED, or
Black's  Editor.  Copy it in your BED:REXX/ directory¹.  Add an item to the
'AREXX'  menu.   In order to do this, load the BED:Support/StartUp.dfn file
in  any editor.  Go to the line containing MENU "Arexx" (normally line 185)
and add:

ITEM  "EAutoGuide"          ""  ExecARexxMacro BED:Rexx/EAutoGuide.bed path

(never mind the spaces)

where   path  is  the  COMPLETE  path  where  you  have  put  both  the
E_AutoGuide.guide  and  the  E_Autoguide.ref files (both are to be found in
the E_AutoGuide.lha archive).

Amigaguide  will  then display the keyword under your cursor, together with
all the info you need, on a seperate BED public screen.

¹  BED:   is a logical device set up after loading BED.  It's the directory
where BED and its files are found.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE PATHNAME (ie doc_path or path) SHOULD BE _WITHOUT_ THE LAST SLASH.  For
example,  if  E_AutoGuide.ref is in your "Work:AmigaE/Docs/" directory, you
should enter as path "Work:AmigaE/Docs" (omitting the quotes ofcourse).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

No  credit  should  go  to  me,  but  to Sven Steiniger instead.  One major
modicifation  I  have  made  is,  apart  from the adaption to the different
editors,  that  case  doesn't  matter anymore.  In Sven's script the script
would  say  it  hadn't found a particular keyword when the case of the word
under  the  cursor  and  the  word  in  the .ref file didn't exactly match.

I hope Sven Steiniger won't mind my modifying his script.  Sven, if you do,
please tell me and I'll promise to be a good boy in the future.  Thanks for
the guides Sven!
