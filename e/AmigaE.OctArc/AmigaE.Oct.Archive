Message-ID:<1993Sep30.224024.10423@msuvx1>

  Well, I got the TEXT_KIND problem solved (see last msg), but now I have
a different problem:  My prog won't exit clean.  If I call it from the CLI,
it will typically 'lock up' on exit.  The window goes away, but it won't
allow me back onto the CLI.  If I RUN it as a task, it seems to exit cleanly,
but a look at my available memory (or a STATUS command) quickly shows me that
the damn thing's still resident.  Same thing if I try to call it from the WB.
I have tried Exit(), CleanUp(), checking all the variables & pointers being
used, and, if they're stll in use, calling the appropriate function to clean
up after myself, and YES I'm closing my libraries.

Any ideas?

P.S. - I'm writing this in E, but C examples are welcome.

thanks,
mark

I'm shure you tried CleanUp(0)..

are you shure you close the window with the same pointer you opened
it with?
Just brainstorming here..Try 'Dispose()' on any allocated memoryblocks..
good lucks...

Subject: re: Font.e demo program

Kai, I tried you Fonts.e program.  It compiled and run except that I had
problems exiting via the ^C.  Before I tried the ^C, I had clicked the mouse a
few times and banged on the return key once or twice.  After that, the ^C did
not work and I had to get rid of the screen by using the three-finger salute.

Any hints?

Subject: Problems with GUI's

*** NEC (New E Coder) - Please talk slowly **

Having jumped feet-first into E, from the horrors of C and the innocence
of BASIC, I've had a few problems, some of them trivial, some of them major.
But I've managed to knock together the basic frame of a program, and the
time has come to add the GUI, and show it off to the world.

So I've got GadToolsBox, Srcgen and everything I thought I needed. But
I'm having *real* difficulty in doing the simplest of things; i.e.
presenting a window with 5 or 6 "buttons", waiting for one to be clicked,
and then proceeding with the relevant part of the proggy ...

Can any kind soul post a quick example of what I need, or even just a
few pointers. I'm not thick, just a bit confused ... (honest!)

Oh alright then, I'm thick (durr).

Cheers!


Kenny.

Subject: EDS - beta version


  Firstly, I guess these comments should be addresses to the author (WiZkid)
and not to this list, but I have a feeling some of you may get the same
problems (if they haven't already been discussed) and the author reads this
list (Hi WiZkid!) so I'll kill two birds with one E-mail and continue writing
this very long sentence.
  Basically, I downloaded EDS from Aminet and gave it a go last night (it's
the latest version in dev/e).  I couldn't get it to work for a very long time.
First up, there was an error "Can't find gadtoolsbox.library" so I duly made
an assign to include the distribution libs directory.  No change.  It still
complained it could find that library.  A quick SnoopDos and I could see that
powerpacker.library and nofrag.library were being searched for so I found
these (off Demo2 CD), and plonked them in a suitable place.  I'm not sure
if this is gadtoolsbox's fault or EDS's, but maybe WiZkid could include the
libraries in the next release?
  OK. So the libraries got sorted.  Next up it couldn't open the screen.  Try
as I might I couldn't get it to do anything.  I tried altering the SCREENMODE
tooltype to PAL but it still wouldn't have it.  I almost gave up.  Then I
tried booting my A1200 (that's what I was trying it on!) in NTSC mode.  No
change --- I mean I was still in PAL mode!  That gave me a clue: try putting
the NTSC monitor from Storage: into Devs:Monitors.  When I did that it
worked.  However, there's this really annoying flick when you swap PAL to
NTSC screens, so I tried to get EDS in PAL mode.  Still no luck.  I don't
think the tooltype stuff works. Any ideas WiZkid, or anyone else?  Also, it
wouldn't be so bad if the system requesters didn't pop up on my Workbench
and swap the screens (NTSC to PAL flick, arrrrgggg).  This can easily be
changed (it's in the RKRM's somewhere [Libs?]).
  Apart from these problems I thought EDS looked quite good.  I'm not sure
if I'd use it if it doesn't do PAL, though (aren't I fussy!). Also, JED
doesn't scroll back properly (it writes all over the Workbench). Maybe I
should try it on the EDS Public Screen?  However, I'm wary of stuff that
fragile...  I think EDS would benefit from its own editor, but then I like
Emacs a lot and would probably use that instead.
   Full marks for the Version control idea, WiZkid.  I use a crappy VMS type
of back up (.<number> after the file) just because I don't want to get into
RCS and all that.  I think EDS would be great just for that feature.
   Well, I hope this info is useful to someone who's trying to get EDS
running.  I'm looking forward to trying the next version.

    This HAS to be GadToolsBox and/or the GadToolsBox.library.  I am going to 
try and pull GTX.lib out and see if it will help.  There should be a patch
for this for you in a day or so which I will post to the list.

    Hmmmm....Which requesters are opening on the Workbench? I think there is
something wrong here, cause Everything is popping up on my EDS screen when I
use it.  This hasn't happened to my Beta tester either when he has tested it.

>  Apart from these problems I thought EDS looked quite good.  I'm not sure
>if I'd use it if it doesn't do PAL, though (aren't I fussy!). Also, JED

    Alright.  JED needs to be opened up on the EDS pubscreen, OR you need to
turn off the SCROLLHACK in the s:jed/jed-startup file.  This you can figure
out how to do in the docs.  It should be something like (setprefs scrollhack
OFF) and just add that line.  On a pubscreen, there is no problem (and, if
the JED version that came with EDS is in C: along with RUNBACK, it should
open on the screen automatically via the Edit Source button)

    I might support GED...If I can get it registered.  It is nice, and it
now has the 3.0 Newlook 3D scrollbars, so I might just do that.  If you have
another editor with an ARexx port that I can support via one line commands,
(except for a few that are full procs), I will try and support it (But I
need a list of the commands).  Registered users will get to choose between
whatever support versions I have (CED and JED and GED?) while unregistered
users will have to use JED.  There is also the possibility of integrating
someones E Editor into EDS.  (I think Barry and a few other people are
working on some (YAPE?))

    Yeah, RCS is a pain in the A**! If I get into PROJECTs in the future, I
might implement a CheckIn/CheckOut feature...maybe even passwords and
compression :-)  I actually had to use EZ_E and the KCX_RCS feature...along
with an ARexx script I ran after it...to give myself revision control while
doing EDS.  I am glad you like it.  It is a picky thing...I want to do lots
with it (make it SMARTER) in the future.  

>   Well, I hope this info is useful to someone who's trying to get EDS

>
>---

    Alright....I think I just figured out a few things.  First off, I think
you may have RENAMED EDS to something different? This won't work.  I ended
up hardcoding the name to EDS because I didn't have time to play with other
code.  This will be changed. (When i start doing project icons)  Secondly,
there is a problem that I forgot to specify some newlook pens in EDS, and
cause I run Mode-Promo utils, I never noticed it.  This will be done in an
hour or so.  So, make sure you have an EDS.info file! (It can't be renamed)
It is opening a Pal screen for me, so I don't think that is it.  It is also
making itself public.  Well, I gotta go fix some things.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      <<<<<<<UPDATE>>>>>>><<<<<<<UPDATE>>>>>>><<<<<<<UPDATE>>>>>>>

    I just fixed everything reported to me already.  I forgot to make a PAL
tooltype, and it no longer needs GTX.lib, and there are a few other small
changes (SA_PENS & such)

As you can see, the time is updated unnecessarily often.  Is there an
easy way to wait one minute and still get a message right away when
close gadget is pressed?

Subject: Another little progette


   Ever tried to read an AmigaGuide document without Multiview or AmigaGuide?
No? Well I have so I wrote this program to make it easier.  In particular I get
Amiga Report by E-mail, and I can't wait until I get home to my Amiga before
reading it...  This little program highlights important bits of the HyperText
instead of buttons and stuff, and basically turns it into a flat file without
all the useful stuff (like links etc.).  Crap as that may seem, it's actually
quite useful, if all you want to do is read the stuff.  Also, it makes the file
printable (using the standard PRT: device).  AmigaGuide files are very difficult
to print properly... (so flattening them is an alternative...).
  As ever, I hope someone can make use of it...  There's two versions, one for
Kick2.0+ and one for the other lot (I don't know how low it goes!).  The source
is included, of course, but I don't guarantee it's any good!

Subject: mathtrans/float problem


Hello all!

I'm having problems using the SPAtan function. I'm trying to calulate the
angle defined by an x,y coord like this:

---------- small source code ---------
MODULE 'mathtrans'

PROC main()
  DEF angle,x,y
  x:=80
  y:=40

  /* angle = arctan(y/x) */

  /* the line I wanted to use 
      angle:=SpFix(SpAtan(SpDiv(SpFlt(x),SpFlt(y))))
  */

  /* test line that goes boom! */
  angle:=SpFix(SpAtan(SpFlt(3)))

  WriteF('\d\n',angle)
ENDPROC
---------- end of small source code ---------

What's up? What makes it crash my machine? (Software failure #8000000B)

Subject: EDS issues

I also played with EDS recently, and had the following issues:
1) The shell pop'd from EDS does not see the full path as defined in the
startup  scripts.  It would be more useful if it used the shell-starup that is
defined in S:.  Is this my problem or an issue with EDS?
2) I could not get Edit Source  to start JED.  JED was in the path pointed to
in the icon.  I was able to run EC, so I put JED in that directory, set the
JED_path to match the EC path and JED still would not start.
3) I would start EDS, do a "NEWSHELL", quit the shell, then quit EDS.  EDS
would not shut down.  I would have to "LOAD", then cancel the load then I was
able to quit.

I am running this on an A2000 with a Hurricane '020 accelerator, AmigaDos v2.1.

Any hints or help?

Subject: Extracting pgm's sent via mail

For: REPUCCI_JOHN

For step 2 of extracting programs sent via mail you need a program called
UUdecode. The general idea of uuencoded stuff is that 3 data bytes are
encoded as 4 graphic characters. So 24 bits of data are encoded into four
characters with 6 infoformation bits and the 2 bits are add to each of the
six bits to insure that each of the 4 characters is a printable character.
Thus any binary character can be moved across a data communication line
without any interference. The UUdecode process is the logical reverse, i.e.
the first 6 bits of the first byte is extracted from the first printable
character, the next 2 bits are extracted from the next printable character
leaving 4 bits for the first half of second byte, etc. I have written both
UUencode and UUdecode programs in E. Not sure what good they may be for you.

In a previous message I said that I could not get JED to start from
within EDS.  Version 39.11 gave me a hint that EDS was expecting the
presence of "runback", which I did not have on my system at that time.
Now that I have a copy, JED starts up just fine.  ( WiZkid, could you
add a comment in your doc's stating that you expect the program
"runback" to be found in the users path someplace? )

re: my comment that the newshell does not show the current path.
I did not find a solution, but I did find another hint.  If I copy EDS to
RAM: and run it from there, newshell shows the correct path, but if I 
start it from its normal path ( dh2:Amiga_E ), newshell shows that the
path is the current directory and c:.

I finally got some time to look a little closer to E, and I found a
mysterious (mayby) bug. I needed to see if some strings were correct
and therefore I used WriteF to print them to the screen, but something
weird happened ...

DEF command[2]: LIST

PROC commandHandle(commandLine)
   DEF com[80]: STRING, comArgs[80]: STRING
   command:= parseLine(commandLine)
   /* parseLine returns first arg of commandLine in command[0]
      and the rest in command[1]
   */
   com:= command[0]
   comArgs:= command[1]
   WriteF('com=\s,comArgs=\s\n',com,comArgs)
   /* Bla bla, some stuff that absolutely nothing did to change either
      com or comArgs .... 
   /*
   WriteF('com=\s,comArgs=\s\n',com,comArgs)
ENDPROC

When the second WriteF was executed com was empty!?! What happens in WriteF?

Nothing happens in WriteF()
Have you SetStr()'ed com correctly, ie; is the first writeF() merely
coincedentally right (SP?)

What wurries me more on the bug-front, is that EC seems to sometimes
crash when it encounters an error (say an ENDIF is missing) in longer
sourcescode. This really bugs me, because EC only tells you in wich 100
lines the compiler was when it crashed!
And because the crash is mostly a complete and utter RESET, I can't
retrieve (undo) info from CED....

I WANT V2.5!!!!!

small suggestion to WiZkid, next time you make something, have it
beta-tested before you make a fuzz about your programme....
A programme should check to see if EVERYTHING it needs is available
before starting, and it should REPORT what's missing.
Never assume a user has a programme (runback for example) but CHECK!

    Do you mean the consoles used for output by EDS or the example shell
from the config file? The output consoles are not for entering commands.
They just give the output from EPP and EC.  The shell should use the path it
is started from. (Might not be, since I am using runback to do this for now)
It must use the shell-startup file from S: since it is a shell.  If you want
it to open in a specific directory, you can put a CD in the shell-startup,
or edit the config and do a NewShell FROM s:EDS-Shell.script CON://////

    One thing not mentioned in the documentation: If you are not using a
root directory or an assign for the tooltypes (E.g "C:" "EDS:" "HD0:") then you
must add the trailing backslash ("HD0:work/programming/e/").  This is
something that is on my list of things to fix in V40.x, but I haven't yet
gotten to it.

    On some machines, there is a load of IDCMP messages, and the signal
flags do not always get set (or so it seems), so what you might need to do
is click out of the one window, and back into the other - Just so that IDCMP
sets the signal flags, and the message is gotten.

    I did just see your problem with the shell (re: quiting then having to
hit a button to exit EDS)...but there is NO problem with the Shell path
here.  Using the NEWSHELL button from ENV:EDS.CFG I am getting the full
path. I do not know why this is happening.  Make sure your S:Shell-startup
has all the PATH commands listed.

    EDS has been Beta tested.  I can only go by the reports of the beta
testers, and everything reported to me (in enough detail) was fixed before
V39.10.  Everything reported by my last Beta tester with problems and
everyone who had problems on the list was fixed by V39.12 - I will continue
fixing things until I am broke :-)  One beta tester lost his internet
account (Hi Dave - I see you are back but Ami-less) and another had to drop
testing cause he had no time (Hi Barry - Have you seen the REAL thing yet?
:-) and hasn't gotten a copy since V0.45 or so.  And then there is some
other person who asked to be a "Babysitter" for my project a LOOOOONG time
ago and I never heard back from (AFTER me sending him the binary and
source...god thing I wrote a dsiclaimer!) 

    I was waiting for a friend/tester to send me the Installer Script he was
working on for EDS, and an updated AmigaGuide (too big with some fonts on
some screens I guess) Doc, but he has lost his phone for a while. (As it is,
I waited 2 weeks for them)

    I would rather have people tell me "It's not working...no PAL..." and
fix it within a day than spend an extra month betatesting and perhaps never
find it.

    Did you install the font? (XEN.font/8) There are some instances where
people have accidentally DELETED their Diskfont library, and didn't know
about it until a program didn't work.  Are you sure you have it installed?
Are you sure you have at least a V37 version of it? These are the only
things I can think of.  Check those, and let me know more about your system.

    I still don't get why it doesn't just automatically open on the EDS
screen.  Could you run EDS for me on your machine, and then maybe find a
program which can tell you the stats of a screen. (I don't think Pubman does
it) (e.g whether it is public/default/shanghai) This is very strange...

    I am working on menus and keyboard equivalents for V40 of EDS.  I just
got started on that the other day before I had to take my obligatory
vacation.  Configurable would not be too hard...only take up another 30
lines of code.  For the keyboard control, I was thinking about using the
CAPS key as a qualifier, and if it is not on, I am thinking about sending
the keycodes to JED. (Think this is a good idea?)

>(By the way, the new version of EDS went PAL and everything! That's how I

    Thats good.

>Oh yes -- well done for fixing the problems so quickly!  I was really shocked.

    Well, I don't want to piss people off more than necessary :-)  I know it
is kindof a haphazard release, but I am not one of those ORGANIZED type of
people :-)

>P.S. If you have menus you could save some screen area and maybe not have to

    I am going to use a screenmode requester (2.1/3.X) in V40, so you can
specify ANY screen you can use, and then AUTOSCROLL.

I would appreciate you taking your negative comments somewhere else.  We don't
care what you think about his package.  The fact that he wrote it at all
warrants more respect than you have bothered showing.  I've yet to see
your version of this program.  I've yet to see ANY software at all written
by you.  Maybe you're just not up to it eh?

Heck, you can't even spell!!

BTW - The font IS in the archive.

Subject: SYSTEMTAGLIST()

Hi! 
      I need help with the SystemTagList function. I can't
seem to get it to work right for me. (I am trying to remove 
Runback from EDS) I will get some type of Guru (recov or dead
end) when I do this or any variation of it:

PROC execprog()
DEF conhandle,compstring[80]:STRING,basename[80]:STRING,error=0
  status('Execute -- SystemTaglist')
  conhandle:=Open('CON:10/16/620/257/EDSOutput/CLOSE/AUTO/SCREENEDS',NEWFILE) 
  StrAdd(basename,nstring,(StrLen(nstring)-2))
  error:=SystemTagList(basename,[SYS_INPUT, conhandle,
                                 SYS_OUTPUT, conhandle,
                                 SYS_ASYNCH, TRUE,
                                 SYS_USERSHELL, TRUE,
                                 NP_CONSOLETASK,NIL,
                                 NP_WINDOWPTR,NIL,
                                 TAG_DONE])
  status('Done')
ENDPROC

The program executes fine, but when it quits, something goes wrong.

What is the problem?  Also, it doesn't crash EDS (everything 
detaches fine) it just gurus - usually telling me that it tried to
free memory that is already free or something like that.

HELP!

    Thanks...I spent a LOT of time on it.  But I bet you spent 
more time on E than me. :-)

    The Demo version, or some form thereof.  I don't want to 
just give it away free, but it would be nice if everyone who
sees 2.5 sees EDS.  BTW: When _IS_ 2.5 coming out? :-)

    Would it be worth it to use EDS in non-interlace with AutoScrolling
interface? The menus are ready in V40, so one really wouldn't HAVE to use
the buttons. I am working on Preferences for Screenmode and Font in V40 -
part way there.  It will be at least another month or two till I get those
done. Why would T0PAZ make the screen SMALLER? XEN.Font is the smallest
(width-wise) and they are both the same size vertically. I have a friend in
my region of the country (closest E prgrammer I know of) who is good at Font
adaptivity and stuff like that, so I will probably get him to help me with
it.  For Now, I think XEN.font is standard issue. (I may support a
standard/half width font option - XEN or Topaz)

>- It maybe that you dislike CED, though the majority of

    CED will probably be supported _IF_ I can get someone to send me the
equivalent codes for the ARexx port. I can make a patch available for those w
ho want CED now _IF_ I get those commands.  Hopefully they should be
reasonably close (i.e. one line commands where JED uses one line commands -
not needing to use multiple commands to do one function.)

>if you could do something about these two (and minor things
>like removing runback etc.), I would probably use it.

    Yes, I would like to remove Runback (fortunately it is one program which
has met the test of time (040) :-) - BUT it is a thing so minor that I can't
see doing it right now. I would probably need to see some code on launching
progs ASycnchornously before I implement it.  Unfortunately, your problems
are the hardest ones to work out quickly because I only want to do
intermittent releases which can keep the update archives around 40K (Patches
would be preferred) while working on V40. :-(

Subject: Re: SystemTagList()


  Well, at last I can distritbute a bit of my experience.  SystemTagList() is
not well documented at all (even if you've got the official AmigaDOS Manual,
which just restates the Autodoc in a proportional font!).  The problem is:
you're running an Asynch task with the same input and output handles. So when
the task finishes it closes *BOTH* handles.  Of course, once it closes the
first one the second close will crash the system.  I guess what you want is
the same console for both input and output... Well, if you can remember back
to my DoTeX program I had the same problem and I solved it by only having
an output handle (which worked OK).  Since then I've discovered a better
solution: only supply the *INPUT* handle and give a NIL for the Output. That
will make the input handle the input *and* output.  Just check the return code
from SYstemTagList, and if it's (I think) -1 you need to close the input handle
yourself.  Otherwise don't close it (the task will close it itself when it
finishes).
  I hope this helps!

Thats not the point.  Its your attitude that needs work.

If you recall, he posted the program and specifically asked for help from
others to use it and report comments.  Others were able to tactfully
report some bugs while at the same time commending him on his hard work
and a potentially very useful utility.  You just came in from nowhere and
flamed him for no reason.  Learn some social manners, otherwise you won't
be taken seriously.

Subject: RKM's for E ?

Is there any interest by the members of this group
in translating the RKM's to E?

If so, I would be willing to act as the coordinator for the
project.

Several benefits:
1)  Provide a large base of programming examples
for the E programmer.
2)  Provide a good set of tests to verify the E compiler.
3)  It would also provide some C programming experience.
( I admit that I should not mention this while sending a 
message to the E programmers group, but it may be a
valid benefit. )

Note:  They are currently in C and available on  two of the
FF disks.  I do not remember the FF numbers.

I have the following problem that appears to be a bug. 


'buffer' is a string of length 256
if I put the following and compile I get a syntax error.


temp:=buffer[0]:=0


BUT if I swap the order of the first two then it compiles fine!  ie

Subject: Some problems

I have two problems.. The first is with IFFParse. This question was
asked in comp.sys.amiga.prog I think.. I just bumped into the problem too.
Here's the code.. pay attention, I'll be asking questions later  :-)
---8<---
MODULE 'exec/types','exec/memory','libraries/iffparse','iffparse','dos/dos'
 
PROC main()
  DEF iff=NIL:PTR TO iffhandle,error,continue=TRUE,
      errormsgs:PTR TO LONG,stream
 
  errormsgs:=['End of file (not an error).','End of context (not an
error).',
              'No lexical scope.','Insufficient memory.','Stream read
error.',
              'Stream write error.','Stream seek error.', 'File is
corrupt.',
              'IFF syntax error.','Not an IFF file.',
              'Required call-back hook missing.',
              'Return to client.  You should never see this.']
 
  IF arg[0]=0
    WriteF('Sift <filename>')
    RETURN 10
  ENDIF
  IF iffparsebase:=OpenLibrary('iffparse.library',0)
    IF iff:=AllocIFF()
      stream:=iff.stream
      IF (stream:=Open(arg,MODE_OLDFILE))
        InitIFFasDOS(iff)
        IF Not(error:=OpenIFF(iff,IFFF_READ))
          WHILE continue
            error:=ParseIFF(iff,IFFPARSE_RAWSTEP)
            IF (error<>IFFERR_EOC)
              WriteF('err=\d\n',error)
              IF error=0
                printTopChunk(iff)
              ELSE
                continue:=FALSE
              ENDIF
            ENDIF
          ENDWHILE
          IF (error=IFFERR_EOF)
            WriteF('File scan complete.\n')
          ELSE
            WriteF('File scan aborted, error \d: \s\n',error,errormsgs[-error - 1])
          ENDIF
          CloseIFF(iff)
        ENDIF
        Close(stream)
      ENDIF
      FreeIFF(iff)
    ENDIF
    CloseLibrary(iffparsebase)
  ENDIF
ENDPROC
 
PROC printTopChunk(i_ff:PTR TO iffhandle)
  DEF top:PTR TO contextnode,i,idbuf[5]:STRING
  IF (top:=CurrentChunk(i_ff))
    FOR i:=0 TO i_ff.depth
      WriteF('. ')
    ENDFOR
    WriteF('\s \d ', IdToStr(top.id,idbuf),top.size)
    WriteF('\s\n',IdToStr(top.type,idbuf))
  ENDIF
  WriteF('\d-\n',top)
ENDPROC

(Sorry about any wordwrapping)
This is basically a conversion of sift.c from the RKMs
The problem is that ParseIFF() always seems to return an error
-5 (stream read error)

Second question..

I wish to create a gadtools gadget GENERIC_KIND with the 'GETFILE' image
(as found in gadtoolsbox).  I have successfully created the gadget,
made it RELVERIFY and even put a basic image into the gadget. I'd
like to be able to put the exact same image as a normal GETFILE gadget.
Is this image available through the system? I see with the gadtoolsbox
sourcecode for C that it uses initGet() some how to get the image??!!
I think that might be a C function? Anyways, any ideas where I can steal
that image from, rather than creating my own?

Thanks!

Subject: Re: Possible bug with 'E' ?


First off: no it's not a bug.  You wrote

 temp:=buffer[0]:=0

and this is really

 temp:=(buffer[0]:=0)

with the inner assignment being an assignment expression (the outer one is an
assigment statement).  In the current version of E you are only allowed to
have a variable on the left-hand side of an assignment expression, so you
can't index an array or select an object element.  When you turned the
assignment round you got:

 buffer[0]:=(temp:=0)

which is valid, since you can have complex left-hand sides of assignment
statements.  This difference between assignment expressions and statements
is probably most annoying when you want to check the assigned value in an
IF statement:

  IF (a[1]:=Inp())=EOF THEN ...

This suffers the same problem as your first example.  Solving this problem is
very complicated because you need to maintain the expression stack and lots
more horrible things.

Subject: Re: Brian Kofoed's bug...


I don't know whether this has been discussed already, but let's have a look
and see if there's a problem anyway.

Brian gave the following code fragment:

DEF command[2]: LIST

PROC commandHandle(commandLine)
   DEF com[80]: STRING, comArgs[80]: STRING
   command:= parseLine(commandLine)
   /* parseLine returns first arg of commandLine in command[0]
      and the rest in command[1]
   */
   com:= command[0]
   comArgs:= command[1]
   WriteF('com=\s,comArgs=\s\n',com,comArgs)
   /* Bla bla, some stuff that absolutely nothing did to change either
      com or comArgs .... 
   /*
   WriteF('com=\s,comArgs=\s\n',com,comArgs)
ENDPROC

And stated that when the second WriteF was executed com was empty.

Well, there's a number of problems:

1) Even though you say they aren't interesting you've left out some lines
   and Murphy's Law states the bug is in those lines.  Maybe you'd like to
   repost the complete program (unless the problem has been solved already).
2) You set up com to be an E string (which is a bit like an ARRAY OF CHAR).
   So initially com holds a pointer to this (local) memory.  Then the line
     com := command[0]
   makes com point somewhere else.  Maybe you wanted to say:
     StrCopy(com, command[0])
   to copy the string in command[0] to the E string com?
   If the command array is set-up by parseLine it might point to memory that
   is now no longer valid.  In your version com also points to this memory.
3) You then do the same with comArgs, so maybe you want to StrCopy again?
4) The first call to WriteF probably is alright (as you say), but by the
   time you've got to the second WriteF the memory pointed to by command[0]
   and command[1] could have been reused, and since you didn't StrCopy them
   the data is lost.  com could then very well be empty. It could actually
   be anything by then!

So, Brian, have a go at StrCopy-ing in the appropriate places, and remember
that a declaration like:
   a[10]:ARRAY    or    s[10]:STRING
puts a pointer to the allocated memory in a and s, so you shouldn't assign
to a or s if you want them to use this memory!  You should StrCopy to copy
the contents of other strings...

Hope this helps...

Subject: Reading PP'd files

Two problems for you all out there ... they're not really E-specific,
but they're causing me problems anyway!

1) Reading PP'd text files

I've halfway through writing a small program, part of which involved reading
in ASCII from a disk-file. I need to be able to random-access the file, and
I'm using a hash table, containing the offsets of the first byte of each 
line in the text file. So all I have to do to read in line 6 of the text file
is look at the hash table to find out the offset of the first byte in line
6, Seek() to it, and read the string. With me so far?
	Now, the text file is a tad large ... 2 Meg at the last count! So
I'd like to incorporate powerpacker.library support. I've got all the
actual mechanics of reading and decrunching the file worked out (not too
difficult ... isn't pp.lib wonderful?), but now my hash table is useless!
The idea of the table was for speed in accessing a certain line of the
file, but now I've got to:

	1) Load the file
	2) Decrunch it
	3) Look up the hash table
	4) Get my line

	... which takes up time, and more importantly, memory.
	Has anyway any idea how I can still use powerpacker library, but 
still let me keep speedy random access?

2) Random numbers

	OK, we've had various different methods for generating random numbers,
but where can I get a good 'seed' from? At the moment, setting the same seed
at the start of a program gives me the same sequence of random numbers *in*
the program...

Cheers!

I haven't seen anything in the way of new requests from the multiline
site (since yours). Are you sure that he sent his request to the admin
address, amigae-request@bkhouse.cts.com?

In any case, if you or he send me (at the admin address) the correct

Subject: Indenting E

H'lo folks,
	One of the troubles I was having with E was keeping my source code
readable. It's all very well to keep indenting your loops and conditions,
but they soon fall apart when you start to debug them (what?? bugs???).
So I've knocked up an ARexx script that'll take any E source, and spit out
beautifully-indented source code. It's geared up to work within CEd, but
it won't be hard to convert it to any editor that supports ARexx.
	Rather than waste bandwidth mailing it to the entire list, I'll
gladly pass on a copy of the script to anyone who wants it. Belive me, it
IS useful; how many times have you struggled to make out which ENDIF belongs
to which IF?


Cheers!


Kenny.

First off, there isn't (as far as I know) a bug in WriteF, but Brian
can't see why his program doesn't do what he wants...

Well, yes that may be true, it depends how 'parseLine' works, but as I
said before I can't imagine you're doing what you thought you were!  Try
replacing the code fragment above by:

PROC commandHandle(commandLine)
   DEF com[80]: STRING, comArgs[80]: STRING
   command:= parseLine(commandLine)
   /* parseLine returns first arg of commandLine in command[0]
      and the rest in command[1]
   */
   StrCopy(com, command[0])
   StrCopy(comArgs, command[1])
   ...
   WriteF('com=\s,comArgs=\s\n',com,comArgs)
   WriteF('com=\s,comArgs=\s\n',com,comArgs)
ENDPROC

(The '...' represents the rest of this PROC)

I also think the 'parseLine' procedure might be doing something funny,
and you've done the same thing wrong with 'command'.  If 'parseLine'
returns a pointer to a LIST, then you probably mean to do this:

  ListCopy(command, parseLine(commandLine))

instead of

  command:=parseLine(commandLine)

It would be wise to send in the 'parseLine' PROC, because you may be
making the same mistakes there, too.  I'll try to explain again why what
you have is wrong:

DEF s[10]:STRING

reserves (about) 10 characters of memory for the string s. The variable
s is then a PTR TO CHAR (really), and it points to that memory. If you
assign to s (i.e., 'com' and 'comArgs' in your example), then you change
where s is pointing, so it no longer points to the bit of reserved
memory. In your assignments 'com' and 'comArgs' were probably pointing
to a bit of memory that was used for local variables in 'parseLine' and
this memory happens to be what you wanted just after the 'parseLine'
call.  But later on in the 'commandHandle' procedure this memory may be
overwritten by local data for other procedures.  That's why the 'com'
and 'comArgs' strings change --- you are using memory you shouldn't be
using.  To remedy this you need to copy the desired string to the
resevered bit of memory.  After the 'DEF com[80]:STRING' the variable
com points to this reserved memory, so you then need to
  StrCopy(com, command[0])
to copy the string.  This relies on 'command' being correctly set up
when you call 'parseLine' (so, in a similar way, you need to
  ListCopy(command, parseLine(commandLine))

If you are still really stuck, send me the whole program and I'll change
it for you, and highlight the problems.  I think the root of the problem
is the fact you aren't using pointers in the correct way, probably
because you don't realise how declarations like 'DEF s[80]:STRING' and
'DEF command[2]:LIST' work.

Let me know if this is helpful or not...

Hello All,
 
For everybody who is going to the Koelner Messe (World of Commodore
show in cologne, 5-7 november), I'll be there on saturday the 6th.
If you want to meet me (or fellow E-programmers), I suggest we settle
a meeting point, for example 12:00 at the commodore stand. I'll
probably wear a badge or something with a big "E" and my name on it,
so you'll be able to recognise me. I advice others to do the same.
Mail me about this if you like.
 
See You All,
 
Wouter

Well.....I'm back!

    Sorry for leaving so abrubtly, but my friend who's account I was using 
for the list got mad at me for suspending him in a local E-Mail echo for

tho....(even tho it is 1000s of miles away) so here I am.  

NORM: I know I should have sent this to Request, but I am LD and didn't want 
to type things twice.  Could you unsubscribe Politikill@cup.portal.com, and 
subscribe me to wherever this is....(So new I don't even know the address.....
I think it is WiZkId@imtired.itm.com )  

     Well, what have people been yelling at me recently ? :-)  I have been 
working my head and fingers off over here, and have almost finished V40.xx of 
EDS.  It has complete PREFERENCES support.....it has been sent out in Beta 
format to some testers.....but NOBODY HAS REGISTERED V39!!!!!  Is it THAT BAD?
I know disappearing didn't help....but I'm back now!!!! :-)  

Short list of features in V40:

     Preferences for Screenmode, font, palette, and defining of buttons BUILT 
INTO the program.  
     Commodity - well, sort of...you can sleep EDS and it will wake when 
Commodities Exchange sends it a SHOW INTERFACE comand (can also be removed 
this way)
      You may set up PROJECTs with EDS....click on a project icon of which 
EDS is the default tool, and have it automatically load a file, and use some 
seperate form of preferences.

MUCH MORE!!!

V40 requires AmigaDos V2.1 or higher!
