This is just a test setup I wrote to quickly demonstrate a live debug session. Simply open up the "EDBG Test" icon from Workbench. This will quickly compile a test program and open up the debugger for you. You can now single step through it until it completes. Watching variables and what it does. Enjoy. :-)
