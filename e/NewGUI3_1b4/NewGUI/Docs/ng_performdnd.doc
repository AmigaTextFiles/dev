ng_performdnd()

SYNTAX:

        x,y:=ng_performdnd(win,self)

FUNCTION:

        This procedure handles all the things during a drag-up and a drop-
        down (like move the image/string)

PARAMETERS:

        win             - PTR to the parent window at which the dragbox
                          is.
        self            - PTR to our own plugin (the dragbox)

RETURN:

        x,y             - The last mouse-coordinates before the user releases
                          the left mouse-button (the Drop-Down-Position!)

BUGS:

        None known! But at this time the Dragging is done with a window
        instead of using GELs, but it works fine!
