ng_readpalette()

SYNTAX:

        ng_readpalette(name,screen,depth)

FUNCTION:

        Reads a IFF-ILBM Palette from a file and sets it to the given
        screen.

PARAMETERS:

        name            - Name of the Palette-File (IFF-ILBM)
        screen          - PTR to the screen which should get the palette
                          and colors set
        depth           - depth of this screen

RETURN:

        None

BUGS:

        None, but this procedure works only up to 32 colors, cause it
        uses SetRGB4() and GetRBG4() instead of SetRGB32() and GetRGB32(),
        in the future i will rewrite this procedure to use the 32-bit
        functions!
