ng_FillBitMapPattern()

SYNTAX:

        ng_FillBitMapPattern(rastport,x,y,width,height,bmp,bmpwidth,bmpheight)

FUNCTION:

        Fills the given rectangle with the given bitmap! If the size of the
        bitmap (given with bmpwidth and bmpheight which could be smaller or
        equal to the real bitmap-size, but NOT greater!!!) is smaller than
        the rectangle then the procedure uses the same bitmap to fill the
        rest (like the WorkBench-Backfill-Patterns!)

PARAMETERS:

        rastport        - PTR to the rastport for drawing
        x,y             - coordinates for the left-upper edge to start
                          filling
        width,height    - dimensions to fill
        bmp             - PTR to the bitmap which should be used for filling!
        bmpwidth        - Width of the source-Bitmap (could be smaller or
                          equal than the real bitmapsize!)
        bmpheight       - Height of the source-Bitmap (could be smaller or
                          equal than the real bitmapsize!)

RETURN:

        None

BUGS:

        None known
