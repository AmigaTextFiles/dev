@node Background "Background"
My third project in Amiga E, this program was born because of a perceived
lack of function-laden tagline generation utilities at a reasonable price.
It originally started as an ARexx script called RexxTag (and RexxTagII, the
functionality of both programs has been integrated into this package) and
has developed into a fast, efficient tool for use by FidoNet points (and
others).
@endnode

@node Features "Features"
AmigaETag contains a number of useful features, listed below.

    @{" Compatibility " link Compatibility}
    @{" Speed " link Speed}
    @{" Functionality " link Functionality}
@endnode

@node Compatibility "Compatibility"
o AmigaETag is fully Commodore Style Guide compliant
o Default program behavior is identical to that of Nico François' fantastic
  point package, Spot
o Works with Spot format tag files without modification
o Line-style tag files can be easily converted to Spot format with the
  included ConvertTag utility
o Compatible with all known point software (tested with Spot, April, Foozle,
  MS-QWiK, and C-Net BBS)
@endnode

@node Speed "Speed"
o Compares very favorably to all known external tagline programs,
  particularly with indexing enabled
@endnode

@node Functionality "Functionality"
o Command-line specification of both tag file and edit file names for
  maximum flexibility
o Option to output taglines to the console for use in redirection or pipes
o Auto-detects the number of taglines available or allows the user to
  specify how many exist for greater speed without need to edit the tag file
o Optional user-defined tag prefix for easy customization
o Allows the use of a predefined seed for predictable tagline generation
o Supports the selection of a specific tagline instead of a randomly-chosen
  one
o Easily allows multi-line taglines to be used via the "%%" separator (used
  by Spot)
o Buffered I/O streams are used for extremely fast and efficient tagline
  additions
o Taglines are automatically stripped from edited messages (or left intact
  via keyword)
@endnode

@node Requirements "Requirements"
o Any Amiga running AmigaDOS 2.04 (V37) or greater
o A file containing from 1 to infinite (theoretical) taglines to be
  randomly appended to the end of messages
@endnode

@node Options "CLI options"
CLI options

    @{" TAGFILE " link TAGFILE}
    @{" EDITFILE " link EDITFILE}

    @{" PREFIX " link PREFIX}

    @{" COUNT " link COUNT}
    @{" NOSTRIP " link NOSTRIP}
@endnode

@node TAGFILE "TAGFILE"
TAGFILE        Argument specifying the tag file to be read from
@endnode

@node EDITFILE "EDITFILE"
EDITFILE       Argument that defines the filename of the message being
               edited.  If this argument is not supplied, output goes to the
               default console instead of being appended to the end of the
               message.
@endnode

@node NUMLINES "NUMLINES"
NUMLINES/K/N   Optional user-specified keyword argument containing the
               number of taglines available in the tag file.  This option
               will drastically improve the speed of the program but
               requires the user to know *exactly* how many lines are
               present in the file.  The number of taglines available can be
               found by using the COUNT keyword.  Misuse of this argument
               can cause program operation to fail, although arguments less
               than 1 are automatically detected as inappropriate and will
               cause the program to exit with an error.  If the number of
               lines in the tag file is unknown (and therefore this argument
               is not used), the program will automatically calculate the
               number of taglines available.
@endnode

@node PREFIX "PREFIX"
PREFIX/K       This keyword argument allows the user to define the prefix
               placed before each tagline.  Leading and trailing spaces are
               *not* added by the program to allow maximum flexibility.
               Default behavior is to use Spot-compatible tagline prefixes.
@endnode

@node SEED "SEED"
SEED/K/N       An argument requiring the keyword to accept a user-defined
               random number seed instead of the built-in random seed based
               on the system clock.  Use of this argument will cause very
               predictable random keyword choices and is done primarily for
               debugging purposes.
@endnode

@node TAG "TAG"
TAG/K/N        Use of this keyword argument will cause the program to use
               the tag number specified (the first line in the tag file is
               tag number 1, the second is number 2, etc.) instead of
               choosing a random tagline.  NOTE: This keyword cannot be used
               in conjunction with the SEED keyword since a random tagline
               is not chosen.
@endnode

@node NLSTRING "NLSTRING"
NLSTRING/K     A keyword argument to define the string used to break up a
               tagline into multiple lines.  The default behavior if this
               argument is omitted is to use '\n' as the delimiter.
@endnode

@node ADDNL "ADDNL"
ADDNL/S        A switch that adds an additional newline to the end of the
               tagline.  Default value is off.
@endnode

@node COUNT "COUNT"
COUNT/S        Returns the number of taglines available in the tag file to
               standard output and exits the program.
@endnode

@node NOSTRIP "NOSTRIP"
NOSTRIP/S      If this switch is selected, previous taglines will not be
               stripped from the message being edited.  Taglines are
               stripped by default.
@endnode

@node Installation "Installation"
o Using your favorite editor, create a text file named "Editor" in your
  Mail: directory (or other appropriate location) with the following
  contents:

      .key EDITFILE/A
      .bra {
      .ket }

      AmigaETag <<tag file>> {EDITFILE} <<options1>>
      <<editor used with point system>> {EDITFILE} <<options2>>

  @{" Notes " link Install_notes}
  @{" Example " link Example}

o Make the script executable by typing "protect Mail:Editor +s".
o Replace the name of your editor in your point software with "Mail:Editor"
  as appropriate.

  Spot example:

      Mail:Editor "%s"

o Ensure proper operation of the program by sending a test netmail to
  yourself.  Your message should have a random tagline appended to the end
  of it during editing.
@endnode

@node Install_notes "Notes"
o Your editor and AmigaETag must either be in the path or fully qualified
  (i.e. SYS:C/AmigaETag)
o <<tag file name>> is the full path to your tag file
o <<options1>> includes any arguments supported by AmigaETag
o <<options2>> includes any options appropriate for your editor
@endnode

@node Example "Example"
.key EDITFILE/A
.bra {
.ket }

AmigaETag Mail:Taglines {EDITFILE} NUMLINES 5
Ed {EDITFILE} WINDOW "RAW:0/0/640/200/Editor/CLOSE" TABS 4
@endnode

@node Notes "Notes"
o Each line in each tag must be 512 characters or less or the line will be
  truncated
o Tag files must have the following format:

  This is a tag line.
  %%
  This is another tag line.
  %%
  This is a multi
  line tag line.
  %%
  This is the last tag line in this file.
@endnode

@node Bugs "Known bugs"
    o Taglines do not appear randomly when using large tag files
