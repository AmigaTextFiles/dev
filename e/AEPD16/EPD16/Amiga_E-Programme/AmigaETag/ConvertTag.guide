@node TAGFILE "TAGFILE"
TAGFILE/A      A required argument that defines the name of the tag file to
               be converted.  WARNING: The original tag file will be
               replaced by the converted one, please make a backup of the
               original!
@endnode

@node BREAK "BREAK"
BREAK/K        This keyword argument allows the user to define the break
               string after each tagline that is searched for when
               converting.  Default behavior is to use "\n" as the break
               string.
