ConvertTag
----------

This program is a small supplement to the AmigaETag package designed to
convert tag files from other packages to a format compatible with AmigaETag
and the Spot point package by Nico François.

ConvertTag contains a number of useful features, listed below.

    Compatibility:

        o ConvertTag is fully Commodore Style Guide compliant
        o Designed to work in conjunction with AmigaETag
        o Compatible with all known tag file formats

    Functionality:

        o Command-line specification of tag file name for maximum
          flexibility
        o Optional user-defined break string for easy customization
        o Buffered I/O streams are used for extremely fast and efficient
          tagline conversion

Requirements
------------

    o Any Amiga running AmigaDOS 2.04 (V37) or greater
    o A file containing from 1 to infinite (theoretical) taglines separated
      by a break string (default "\n")

CLI options
-----------

TAGFILE/A      A required argument that defines the name of the tag file to
               be converted.  WARNING: The original tag file will be
               replaced by the converted one, please make a backup of the
               original!
BREAK/K        This keyword argument allows the user to define the break
               string after each tagline that is searched for when
               converting.  Default behavior is to use "\n" as the break
               string.

Known bugs
----------

    None
