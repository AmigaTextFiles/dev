Short: Boopsi Examples in E (and fixed icclass.m)
Type: dev/e
Author: various / Wouter van Oortmerssen

This archive contains a fixed version of intuition/icclass.m
(which magically contains a wrong tag for ICA_TARGET), and two
example sources which need it, and previously didn't work.

Both examples are translated from C, and include the originals,
so people can learn from the translation. They are:

- Talk2Boopsi.e, originally from RKRM examples.

- ScrollerWindow.e, originally from Christoph Feck, needs
  the v39 emodules/EC to compile (available from where you
  found this)
