@NODE introduction "Introduction"
    In this GenCodeE release, you will find two GenCodeE : the 1.7
version and the 2.2 version. The first one generates code for Amiga E
v2.1b and the second one for Amiga E v3.0b+. As Amiga E v3.0 is a major
update compared to Amiga E v2.1b, it seemed to me that it was
necessary to make two different code generation modules. In the
future, all the GenCodeE with 1.x as version number will generate code
for Amiga E v2.1b and those with 2.x as version number will generate
code for Amiga E v3.x. The generated codes by these two modules are
not really different, but the 2.x version heavily exploits the new
features of Amiga E v3.0, especially the OO aspect.

    To make such a code generator isn't as easy as it seems. Indeed,
the generated code must be as perfect as possible to avoid to the
programmer to modify it, but nethertheless it must be readable if the
programmer really wants to modify it. After a lot of attempts, I think
I reach "a good level". However, I haven't yet had time to really test
the code generated by these two new GenCodeE on a big application, so
it must be possible to enhance some details. So don't hesitate to send
to me your comments and your suggestions (see the @{"author" link auteur}).

    Finally, you will need Mac2E (v4.0+ is better) to use the
generated code and in addition EPP (v1.4d is better) for GenCodeE
v1.7. These two programs are available in the PD collections. If you
haven't them, stop reading now and find them ! In the same way,
FlexCat (also available in PD collections) is heavily recommended to
automagically generate localization code, but it isn't absolutely
needed. Finally, AutoBuild (also available in PD collections) is an
excellent replacement of Build for Amiga E v3.0 users.

@NODE code_généré "Generated code"
    The code generated by GenCodeE is now too complex to be explained
simply. So, I chose an example (a significant one) to expose it
rather than long (and difficult) explainations. Begin by watching in
MUIBuilder how is defined the example application DemoGenCodeE,
especially for notifications. After, look at the generated code and
above all the main source DemoGenCode.em in which I put a lot of
comments. Make after some experiments with modifications of
DemoGenCodeE definition in MUIBuilder to see how the code generator
behaves. Try too the different generation options : declarations,
code, notifications, environment and locale. I think that this will be
enough for everybody to understand how GenCodeE is behaving. If
however you meet problems, write to me (see the @{"author" link auteur}).

    DemoGenCodeE has only one window. Inside this one, you can see a
'Click' group and a 'Quit' button. I let you guess what is the effect
of this last one... In the 'Click' group, you can see 4 buttons and a
text gadget. When you click on one of the buttons, this changes the
text gadget contents each time in a different way :
    - the 'Put Constant String' button modifies the text gadget
contents by a notification which directly put in a constant string
    - the 'Put Variable' button modifies the text gadget contents by a
notification which directly put in a variable contents
    - the 'Return ID' button returns an ID (after a click on this
button) when the MUIM_Application_Input method is called, and in this
case, the text gadget contents is modified by a set() call
    - the 'Call Hook' button calls for each click on this button a
hook function which modifies the text gadget contents
    DemoGenCodeE also offers an ARexx command "change_text" which
modifies too the text gadget contents.
    All these cases cover all the differents codes that can be
generated by GenCodeE.

@NODE bugs "Bugs"
    GenCodeE hasn't known bugs. But MUIBuilder has three annoying bugs
which find themselves back in the generated code. Two of these bugs only
appear when you don't generate a whole application but a single object :
    - in this case, MUIBuilder only generates notifications internal
to the generated object : for instance, if A object notifies B object,
this notification won't appear if you only generate A object or B
object
    - MUIBuilder always generates ID, hook funtion and external
variable references, so you may get double declaration errors
    The last bug appears in the case of notifications on menus. Indeed,
the menu items are locally generated (i.e. not in app_obj, etc), so
they aren't "visible" from the init_notifications() method.
    Contact Eric, and not me for this bug !
