Subject: The Magic 8 Ball, or how to use AreaEllipse...

Here's my wonderful (yeah right :^) )  Magic 8 Ball.
It's really simple.  Ask a question, click on the ball. :^)
And it shows the right (I hope) way to draw circles in a
window on the workbench screen.  If there's any glaring
logical errors in the program flow please tell me, I mean it
runs and all, but I haven't torture tested it :^)
Oh, you need times 18 in fonts:

Have fun
Alan
