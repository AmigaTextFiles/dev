Subject: Programmer Project Interface Source

This is the source code for PPI, which I just posted to Aminet.  You can
get the source from there too, but I wanted to make sure all the E'ers got
a shot at it (not like we look at every little upload on Aminet eh?).

The docs are in the Aminet distribution too, if you have more questions.

Mail me for questions about this (platt@mhd1.moorhead.msus.edu).

Do NOT flood the list with questions.

Oh, be sure to edit out my .signature from the end of this mail message
and edit out this prelude too.  Just reminding everyone!  :+)

A modified version of Eformat was used to make things uniform.
(My version makes indents a single space, rather than a tab char.)
