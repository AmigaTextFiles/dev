Subject: AppIcon.e

Yes!!! I did it.  I found that in order to read the names of the objects
dropped on an AppIcon you have to reference a wbarg structure at arglist
in the appmessage structure.  (Errrkkk!!)  Thanks to my friends includes I
figured this out.  So it wasn't a bug in E, but durn close.

Here's the completely functioning source for a 100% (not yet) usable AppIcon.
