            |     EDS is an environment for programming in the `E' Language. It     |
            | lets you edit, revise, comment, pre-compile, and compile your sources |
            | from one interface. Unlike some other programming tools developed for |
            | E, EDS is complete! It opens up its own (public!) screen, which other |
            | programs can share. Where some others only let you run your editor,   |
            | EDS gives you control over the editor FROM EDS!  And, you can         |
            | configure EDS to suit your own needs! So, if any of this sounds even  |

      EDS was created by me, a 10th grader in high-school, over my summer vacation. I got
in touch with someone who I found out was also working in E (hi George!) through a local
(well, it's in the same state...) Amiga BBS (Call the Amiga Asylum: Official GammaSoft & 
SoftSmith support BBS - 508-372-2388) where I first got the E archive.  My first project 
was going to be a conversion of my ARexx program, GammaTag...but that was a total and 
utter BUST! I couldn't get even the basics done...but while I was still fiddling with it,
George and I started calling each other, longer and longer each time...he sent me his 
source to a SoundOff, which I made a few modifications to.  During on of our little talks,
we discussed things that would be "cool to do in E".  One of them was a programming system.
I think it was actually George's idea, but he was working on CreepShow (when are we gonna see
this awesome thing?) so I started making an interface in GadToolsBox, uploaded it to the 
Asylum, and he liked it! So I then converted it to E source (where is SrcGen?!) by hand...
...now a shell of a program, I dropped GammaTag completely, and began making EDS work. The 
first thing I did was make it write a header to a new file, and attached it to a button.
From here, things exploded into somekind of programming mushroom cloud! Eventually, I got it 
to a point where it DID something! And now it does EVERYTHING: With lotsa help from everyone
on the Amiga E Mailing List, and even more from George (sometimes just a person to bounce 
ideas off of)...and endless staring at the the RKM Libraries for 2.04 (Come on already! I 
need 3.0 RKMs!)...and now its done!

@node Share "Shareware and ©opyright info"

    EDS is a shareware program, if you use it, you must register it. If you
want to see future versions, then you should register it. I am putting a
requester on the save function, to further remind you. If you are a ßeta
tester, you do not have this requester, but if you continue to use EDS after
the trial is over, you should register it too (Of course, I'll give ya a
discount...) If you decide not to register it, you must delete it after 7
(seven) days.  And furthermore, if you don't intend to use it, but you think
it's a nice piece of work, I'll take donations :-) (These are not any set
amount...over the registration key gets you the update disk tho :-) EDS is
not to be included in any commercial product, in any form. If you want to
include EDS in a commercial product, the author MUST be payed a set loyalty
charge (no more than the registration fee, but depending on the quantity, it
could be lower). EDS is not to be redistributed in it's registered form, but
the unregistered version may be put on BBSs only. The only exception to that
rule is Fred Fish (CD or Disk) and to Wouter, if he feels like doing
something with the unregistered form.  Any other collection that charges for
the disk containing EDS must recieve permission from the author. You can of
course give the NON REGISTERED VERSION TO YOUR FRIENDS.

    I am making the product shareware to pay for my phone bill which kept me
in touch with the Amiga E mailing list. But, since I don't like to pay lots
of money for any shareware program (Rush, Terminus, etc) I didn't want to
make it cost too much.  I figure $15 is reasonable enough for anyone to pay
(thats usually low enough for me to break down and give the author some
credit), so that is what I am making registration. That $15 goes towards the
$100+ of dollars I spent this summer getting the E Mailing List alone, a
disk with your own, personalized copy of EDS (and anything else I can thro
on), mailing of the disk, and of course the usual blood, sweat, and
electricity that went into the making of EDS. (please kids, don't try
combining the last two ingredients at home... :-)  If you want the source
code, it is an extra $5.  I don't want the source being modified and
redistributed, so I figure I'll charge extra for it.  BUT, it is a great
example for those just learning E. It uses ALOT of the system (ASL,
ReqTools, ToolTypes, Reading/Writing files, Strings (cause of 99.9% of my
early crashes), GadTools, and much much more) to do certain things.

    So, here is the breakdown:

          EDS Registration............$15.00
          EDS Source...................$5.00
          ----------------------------------
          Both........................$20.00

    BTW: You have to register to get the source :-)

    You can send CASH (US $$) or a Money Order (Postal is OK) with the
correct amount to:

        GammaSoft - EDS Registration
        Attn: WiZkId
        8 Jared Ln
        YarmouthPort, MA  02675

    If you need to contact me, for any reason (such as asking if I will take
a check) I can be reached, for now, on the internet at
Politikill@cup.portal.com   This is a friends account, so if the monies
start rolling in, I will probably switch over to my own account (again) on
Portal.

@node Install "Installing EDS -- Early ßeta Release"

    To use EDS, you need a few things.  See @{" About " link About} for the
list of requirements. To install everything, and get it in a working state,
you need to follow a few steps. 

    (1)  EDS and it's icon (they must have the name "EDS" and "EDS.info")
         must be put where you want them. Make sure the icon is in the same
         directory as the program!
    (2)  E (including EC and the modules in EMODULES:) must be installed.
         SEE THE E DOCUMENTATION FOR MORE SETUP INFO
    (3)  You must install JED. This involves putting the macros included
         in S:jed/ (jed-startup and jed-menus), and putting JED somewhere.
         SEE THE JED DOCUMENTATION FOR MORE SETUP INFO
    (4)  Put the XEN.font in FONTS: (note, this may need to be installed as
         your system default font. This should not be a problem for you if
         you have some taste...it is a very nice T*PAZ replacement)
    (5)  Copy the default config file, EDS.cfg, to ENVARC: See @{"Customizing EDS" link Setup}
         for info on seting this to your own personal liking. 
    (6)  You should install EPP somewhere. EPP is supported in this release
         of EDS, and will be until E is released with some form of this
         standard.

    I'm pretty sure thats all there is. You may not like some of the things
I did, like not letting you select your own personal editor or font. But,
that's life, you're stuck with JED (my favorite) and XEN.font. If you whine
loud enough, and show me a better editor, I may consider making a version
for you. I WILL NOT supprort CED. Frankly, it sucks. I "saw" version 3.5 of
it about 2 weeks ago, and it is completely non-2.0 user interface style
guide compliant.  I would consider making you a version for GoldEd. I like
JED, and use it, so I am supporting it.  There is a great possibility that
the next version (major) of EDS will have a built in editor, so you won't
have to worry about it.  But, I was thoughtfull, and I gave you 15 buttons
you can configure on your own. See @{"Customizing EDS" link Setup} to find out how to 
do set EDS up to your liking.

@endnode

@node Setup "Customizing EDS -- Early ßeta Release"

    There are a few things I wanted when I started out on the "EDS Project",
and one of them was being able to do my own thing. I know others think like
this, and that is one of the reasons the "other" tool for programming in E
is not more widely used, you can only run a few things from it.  So, once I
had the basics done, I went out and started making things configurable.

     First on my list was the Screenmode. I use an Amiga 4000, which is for
my parents video business, to program on. I also have a multisync monitor.
None of my beta testers have a multisync, although one has an A1200 so he can
"promote" my DBLNTSC screen down to NTSC when I forget to change it. So, I
would keep having to lookup the NTSC Hi-Res Interlace DisplayID and change
it when I wanted to send out a version for my beta testers to look at. So,
that was one of the first things on my list. You can now set EDS to open up
in a certain display. I currently have it set up to let you use NTSC,
DBLNTSC or PAL. (SCREENMODE=NTSC, etc) 
      Then, after one of my ßeta testers had an "Insert Volume XXX"
requester pop up, I realised that not everyone will have their HDs set up
the same way.  So you can change the paths for EC, JED, EPP, your project
directory, and your PMODULEs directory. (see the icon for the correct way to
set these)
      You can also change the port to which EDS sends the ARexx commands for
JED to. I have a JED running when I am programming EDS, so the port
associated with EDS is the second copy. You probably don't have to worry
about this.
      Then, figuring it might be nice to be able to set a few buttons on
your own, I thought I'de make it so you can set up the actions on a few
gadgets. So, I came up with a config file, and a parser for it. EDS.cfg goes
in ENVARC: (copied to ENV: at bootup) and is a 15 line file with each line
defining a gadget and its action. Here is the format:

NUM|GADGET_TEXT|TYPE|COMMAND|MISC
---------------------------------
001|NewShell|DOS|Newshell CON:10/16/620/257/EDS_Shell/CLOSE/SCREENEDS|#
015|Wakup DOpus|REXX|wakeup|OPUS.1

    In the first example, gadget 1 is defined as NewShell, of type DOS, which
will open a shell on the interface, the exact size and position of the
definitions window. The second one is totally made up. But, it does show the
format for a REXX type command. For a REXX type command, you send the string
in COMMAND to the port in MISC. COMMAND can be a string upto 70 chars long.
for a DOS command, just put a pound sign or an asterisk in MISC. Seperating
the different clauses are vertical bars (shift backslash) with no spaces
around them.

    Take a look at ENVARC:EDS.cfg to see how things are done.

    Also, there are two ENV:Variables (AUTHOR and COMPANY) which should be
set in the user startup. Alternativly, you can take a text editor and put
your name and company in ENVARC:AUTHOR and ENVARC:COMPANY with a text editor
(make the first line the variable). It does not matter.

@node Using "Using EDS -- Early ßeta Release"

    Oh God, I've already told you how to set it up, and now I suppose you
want me to tell you how to use it :-(

    Alright, I give! Everything is pretty self explanatory. When you LOAD a
source file in, it will try and read the revision header from it, and will
load it into memory. It also starts notification on the file when you load
it in, so that the latest version of it is always in memory. (NOTE: This
means that you cannot use EDS when working with an XFH handler...there is a
bug in XFH) When the file is loaded in, if EDS finds a revision header, it
will bump up the revision by .1 or .01 (depends on what the previous
revision number was). LOAD brings up an ASL requester, RELOAD loads the file
set in the name string gadget.

    When loaded in, EDS will display the Filename, Author, Company, Todays
Date, the TIME when EDS was started, and the revision string.  These are all
in string gadgets. You can edit them by hand (TAB CYCLING is enabled) if you
wish, and the info will be updated in memory. 

    When you SAVE, the information from the above string gadgets will be
inserted into a (new) header in your source file (appended to the source).
You can also use SAVE-AS to save the source with the header to a new file.
This will bring up an ASL req for you to choose a filename (you can also
write over another file this way, be careful!). BE WARNED, these functions
of EDS DIRECTLY MODIFY THE SOURCE FILE, I WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY
FOR LOST OR TRASHED SOURCE. NOTE: If you use SaveAs, you should call a
RELOAD afterwards to start a notify on the new file.

    Also saved, but not replaced, are comments for the current revision.
With each revision, the prior comments are added to. I would only save the
file when you have done something that represents a markable change in the
source, as these comments can add up.  If they get to be too long, just
start deleteing them from the end. 

    From EDS, you can call many different things. The first of these built
in things is the text editor. I chose JED for my editor, as nobody was
willing to write an editor in E with the same functions for me.  Hitting
EDIT will open up JED with the current file loaded in (or none at all, as
the case may be).  When you save a change in JED, it is automatically
reloaded into EDS. Also, I have provided you with a number of different
functions (jump, find, etc) of JED from EDS.  These give EDS a direct
interface to JED through ARexx. You can define more of these, if you want,
using your custom config file. 

    Also, EDS lets you call EPP, the famous pre-compiler. EDS will creat a
backup copy, in case the pre-compile fails. This is deleted, if I my memory
serves, after the pre-compile is done. You may want to do a SAVE-AS to RAM:
before pre-compiling.  If you have a better way, you can make a script,
calling EPP on your own. Output is sent to a CON: opened on the EDS Screen.

    And, finally, EDS calls EC, the heart and soul of E. No options are
passed, so you must set them manually in your code.  If enough people
complain, I will probably change this, but for now thats the way it stands.
Output is sent to a CON: opened on the EDS Screen.

    The last EDS function is SendRXMsg. This will put up a reqtools
requester asking you for the port first (defaults to AREXX) and then the
command (will default to last command or none). Does not return any arguments

    There are also 15 commands that are basically just ARexx interfaces to
JED.  Some are more involved, such as INSERT PMODULE or FIND STRING, but all
are self explanatory. None will work if JED isn't running, but some will
put up an EasyRequester and others won't do any action. The simple ones have
the least amount of checking involved.

@node Bugs "EDS Bugs!? -- Early ßeta Release"

    Hey, since this is the first release of EDS, I know there are probably
some bugs.  This puppy hasn't even been tested as things stand now, except
for two people playing with it in their spair time. 
    I do know of about 8 enforcer hits, they are at startup and at ext, and
I think may have something to do with my libraries, but I don't know why. It
could also have to do with my screen or windows. I hope to have this fixed
real soon. (know nothing about debugging enforcer hits in E, or any lang for
that matter...)
    This whole thing has basically been done in the later hours of the day,
for this whole summer. My most productive hours are between 1:00-3:00PM and
10:00-1:30PM, so there are probably spots done in the latter time period
that are not quit up to spec. My sincere appologies...but lemme know if you
find em!

    · AppIcon/AppWindow
    · Commodity (sleeping)

@node ReqTools "About ReqTools.library"

    ReqTools is a standardized requester library © Nico Françoise

    It needs to be placed in LIBS:

@endnode

@node AmigaE "Amiga E Version 2.1b"
    
    Amiga E is a language, somewhat of a cross between modula, pascal, and
C, for the Amiga. It is very powerful, and has great support from the
author, Wouter van Oortmerssen. Find it and give it a try if you already haven't.

@endnode

@node Jed "JED Version 2.07"

    JED is a 2.x/3.x Editor, based upon the old DME programmers editor.  It
is freeware (or some other form like that).  I haven't yet been able to get
in touch with the author, J. Harper, but am including it in the package
because it is the basis of editing in EDS, and the best programmers editor
that I've seen to date.

@endnode

@node ARexx "AREXX"

    ARexx is © William Hawes, and is included with the Version 2.0/3.0
Software.

@endnode

@node Runback "RUNBACK"

    Runback is a small program which detaches a command from the current
cli...I hope to get this replaced real soon, but it should go in C: for now.
You should be able to find it anywhere, or already have it.

@endnode

@node MagicWB "Magic Workbench"

    MagicWB is a compilation of icons, patterns, and fonts for use with
AmigaDos 2.x/3.x. It is shareware, and REALLY complete! Find out more about
it.  XEN.font is one of the fonts from MagicWb (Topaz replacement) and looks
great at hi-res!

@endnode

@node EPP "EPP - The Pre-Compiler by Barry Wills"

    EPP is a small, but useful utilitiy that makes it possible for users to
make their source modular. By inserting PMODULE strings into source, with
the path of a PMODULE file after it (the PModules are just little E sources
that contain procs used often).  When EPP is run before the compiler, it
replaces all the Occurences of PMODULE 'xxx/xxx' with the correct info.

@node update "EDS ßeta Version V0.98ß - UPDATE!"

    If all goes well, this will be the last beta release. Any more bug 
fixes will come after version 1.0 (or 39.10 as the case may be), and might
not come until version 2.0 (basically bug fixes, if any left, and the 
preferences section...depends on how soon I get IFFParse.lib code :-)

    I have fixed one bug which was taking up about 10K of RAM (6K Chip and 
5K Fast) but I am still losing about 300 bytes...I am not going to pull my 
hair out over 300 bytes, so that is in there to stay. 

    There were a few problems in version 0.90-0.95, most were fixed in a 
somewhat internal release of Version 0.96 - The biggest of these was a 
problem where EDS opened up on a 1 bitplane screen instead of a 4 bitplane
screen...I fixed this by making it an 8 color screen. This ONLY happened on
a souped up A500 where the Denise was "hacked" so it had 2 video slots. Go 
figure :-)

    Also, I am now using ReqTools instead of EZRequest for most things...this
just lets you hit return. I have also implemented some SerialNumber and 
Registration coding...you need to register this one, even if you are a ßeta
tester.  If you have a problem with this, let me know...I'm not greedy, just 
need something to show for a summer in front of the computer :-)

    School has started up again, and I find that I have perhaps 2-3 hours a 
day when I am not busy, after I get through with school and homework, and 
usually then I am too groggy to do anything but play games. So, if you have 
a bug you want fixed, and don't have the source or ability to do it yourself, 
it may take me a while to get it done. 

    Also, some of you AGA users have complained about JED, and it not working 
on AGA...It does work, when you open it on a public screen. I know, because I 
have an A4000! If you still can't get it to work for you (there is a scrolling
problem on workbench) then you can set up your startup-macro to turn of the
"scrollhack" each time it is run. 

    Some people have asked me to support CED, besides them being able to define 
their own 15 buttons.  At least for now I will not.  Some have suggested that I
set EDS up to look for a drawer filled with ARexx scripts for each button. I do 
not like the idea of that, as it would clutter things more than necessary. I do 
still plan to incorporate my own editor, or someone elses, done in E, into EDS. 
I will still let you set the 15 buttons, and maybe even more, but I will have my 
own direct tie in to the editor, so things will be uicker and I could do more.

    I know I am forgetting some things, cause I know that I always forget 
something.  If you aren't clear on something, let me know, and I will fill
you in.  Also, I would like some feedback not only on EDS, but my documentation
as well.
