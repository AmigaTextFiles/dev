Eformat V1.2 Documentation

	Legal stuff, I guess. I make no warranties as to what this software will or will not successfully do. I take no liability for any damage it does. In other words, if it screws up your source, it's not my fault.

This Program is Freely Distributable Sourceware.

	That means, if you like the program and use it, send me some of your source, in E. (Which is what this program was written in!). If you're not an E programmer, send me one of: Brand new *nix RPG port, Brand new Strategy/Tactical/Empire game, cool mods/samples or finally, a registered version of your software and I'll return the favor.
	For those of you who don't know what E is, I'll plug it for you. E is a very nice, fast, small language that allows you to easily do pretty much anything C can do, but doesn't take up 40 megs of HD space and an 030. In fact, E is running on my 2 floppy, 2 meg A1200 right now and compiling damn fast. The latest version of E is version 2.1b, by Wouter Van Oortmerson.(sp?), Thanks Wouter! Hurry up with 2.5!

The program itself:

	Very, very simple program I wrote for myself to clean up all that horribly messy example source that comes with E. Usage is as such:

eformat >ram:whatever messysource.e

	The redirection is the only way you'll get the output into a file. I could've done it with a source file name, but then it would've taken me some time to write, instead of the 3 or 4 hours it did. I've put some more refinements in since then, and any E programmers may feel free to steal stuff from it.
	Eformat will properly nest all control structures, IFs, SELECTs, etc.. Try it, and as Wouter says, feel the power!

Known bugs and history:
V1.0
	Unfortunately, Eformat does not correctly format it's own source. The reason is because it's not truely parsing the code in a really smart manner, so if somebody is REALLY REALLY messy, it probably won't work correctly. I may fix this in the future. (Yah, and pigs could fly.) No, really, it could happen!

V1.1
	Version 1.0 had some stupid bugs in it that I missed. Fixed were:
	-Eformat now properly does SELECTs, nested or otherwise.
	-Got rid of the silly Raise error handling I was using and went back to what I know.
	-Fixed some cosmetic errors.
V1.2
	In getting rid of the stupid bugs in v1.0, I stupidly left the debug stuff in v1.1, rendering the program rather corrupting. This has been removed. Any E programmer would've spotted this (and fixed it) anyway.

What wasn't fixed:
	Still doesn't properly format it's own source. That's because it really isn't all that intelligent about formatting. Like I said, I may fix this in the future, but I have too much else to do right now. Like, an unholy cross of Dirwork and Diropus written in E! It's been underway for several months now and isn't doing too bad. It should be better than either DW1.63 and Dopus 4.x, and will be smaller than Opus at least. My god is that program a pig.
	And finally, if anyone has any suggestions for this program, feel free to relay them. I didn't include any kind of point and click WB interface because I don't really consider it neccesary. Doesn't every real programmer know how to use a shell?
