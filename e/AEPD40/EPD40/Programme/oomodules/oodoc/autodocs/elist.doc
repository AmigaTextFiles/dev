   NAME
       add() of elist -- Add an item to the list.

   SYNOPSIS
       elist.add(LONG)

       elist.add(item)

   FUNCTION
       Adds an item to the list and expands the list if necessary.

   INPUTS
       item:LONG -- Item to add to the list.

   RESULT
       LONG -- -1 if expansion of the list failed. The current list stays
           valid.

   NAME
       elist of object

   PURPOSE
       Handles E's own lists in a more dynamic manner. When the limit of
       items is reached the list is simply expanded.

   ATTRIBUTES
       list:PTR TO LONG -- Normal E list.

       itemCount:LONG -- How many items actually are in the list. Note that
           this is NOT the length of the list.

       hunkSize:LONG -- The number of items the list is expanded by if
           necessary.

   SYNOPSIS
       elist.get()

   FUNCTION
       Gets you the actual E list and it's length. The list may not have all
       it's items set if it was expanded.

       elist.getFrom(position)

   FUNCTION
       Gets the item that's at position in the list.

   INPUTS
       position:LONG -- Position to get the item from.

   RESULT
       LONG, LONG -- 0, "rnge" if the position was out of range, i.e. if it
           exceeded the list's length.

   NAME
       grow() of elist -- Expand a list.

   SYNOPSIS
       elist.grow()

   FUNCTION
       Expands the list by the number of items that is put in the hunkSize
       attribute.

   RESULT
       LONG -- -1 if the list could not be expanded. The current list stays
           valid.

   EXAMPLE

       NEW list.new()

       WriteF('Actual lenght of the list is \d.\n', ListLen(list.list))
       list.grow()
       WriteF('Actual lenght of the list is \d.\n', ListLen(list.list))

   NAME
       init() of elist -- Initialization of the object.

   SYNOPSIS
       elist.init()

   FUNCTION
       Sets the hunk size to the initial value (currently this is 16, that
       may change) and allocates a list that can holg that much items.

   NAME
       kill() of elist -- END all items and the object.

   SYNOPSIS
       elist.kill()

   FUNCTION
       Goes through the list and does an END on each if the item is not NIL.
       After that the object itself is ENDed.

   NOTES
       Only call this function when you really know what is in the list.

   NAME
       putAt() of elist -- Puts an item at a specific position in the list.

   SYNOPSIS
       elist.putAt(LONG, LONG)

       elist.putAt(item, position)

       that position will be overwritten. The list is expanded if necessary.

   INPUTS
       item:LONG -- Item to put in the list.

       position:LONG -- Position to put it at.

   RESULT

elist/select                                                     elist/select

   NAME
       select() of elist -- Selection of action via tag list.

   SYNOPSIS
       elist.select(LONG, LONG)

       elist.select(optionlist, index)

   FUNCTION
       Recognized tags are:
           "list"  --  next item is a normal E list. The object is set to
               hold that list. See elist/set().

   INPUTS
       optionlist:LONG -- list of options

       index:LONG -- index of option list

   EXAMPLE
       see object/select for an example of how select() works in general.

   SEE ALSO
       elist/set()

elist/set                                                           elist/set

   NAME
       set() of elist -- Sets the contents of the list.

   SYNOPSIS
       elist.set(LONG)

       elist.set(elist)

   FUNCTION
       The object is set to point to the list that is given to the function.
       By calling this function you hand the list over to the object. That
       means that you may not free it unless you remove it from the object
       first. Note that the list is automatically freed when ENDing this
       object.

       If the object already holds a list that one is freed first. So if
       you want to remove a list from the object safely after you have passed
       it you may call this function with NIL.

   INPUTS
       elist:LONG -- normal E list. May be NIL.

   EXAMPLE

       -> First allocate it

       NEW elist.new()

       -> set it

       elist.set([1,2,3,42])

       -> now free it
       elist.set(NIL)

   NOTES
       This function is called when you provide the tag "list" in the option
       list for method new()

       elist, new()
