                          EE V0.9.2a - The E Editor.
                       Copyright Barry Wills, 1993-1995.

  BUGS:
  1. I cut two folds from one window, pasted them in another, tried to save
     and the editor crashed.
  2. Proportional fonts are allowed on the commandline...nonono!
  3. Lionel says the busy-pointer-that-won't-go-away is still not going
     away (after selecting 'Edit Prefs')

  NOTE - Cutting-folds crashes are tough to reproduce!  Grrr!
