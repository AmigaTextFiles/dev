@title "EE Introduction"

                             Source Editor and
                          Development Environment
                      for the E Programming Language

This release fixes several nasty bugs and oversights present in the
original distribution found in the E v3.0 demo distribution.  Also added
are case-sensitive Intuition menu command hotkeys, correct handling of
dead keys, keyboard hilighting made more CED-like, speeded up display
updating and search-replace, added option to turn on/off smart indent,
now working ARexx interface, repaired unlimited macros, and a few added
functions.

EE is a multi-tasking, multi-windowing, OS 2.0 compliant, folding
source editor, designed with E, and E programmers in mind.  It has
robust features, equally mouse and keyboard driven, which allow for
quick editing and traversal.  Naturally, it has many features which
enhance the development of E programs, like compiling and running from
within the editor, EC error reporting, relocating the cursor at the
erroneous line, keyword/phrase lookup and completion, and more.

Main features:

  - Completely written in E :-)
  - Multi-windows with hotkey switching and window selection listview;
  - Robust ARexx interface;
  - Nice configuration GUI (thanks to Wouter for his easygui module!!);
  - Custom assignment of any function to any qualifier/key combo;
  - Customizable case-sensitive menu command hotkeys (a la Intuition
    menus);
  - Unlimited macro recording and playback; macros may be called from
    within other macros;
  - Custom fixed-width font support;
  - Smart indent option;
  - Choice of free-form cursor (goes anywhere on screen) .vs. stream-
    oriented cursor (adheres to text, wrapping around at end and
    beginning of lines);
  - Option to open your own public screen; Default and Shanghai modes;
    Open/Visit/Fallback options;
  - Fold on PROCs, OBJECTs, recognized comment, and hilighted block;
    folds can be Cut-n-Pasted;
  - Configurable/editable command slots, as well as the ability to pick
    up hilighted text from the source for execution;
  - Compile with auto-save, auto-backup, asynchronous execution, and other
    options;
  - Single- and multi-line comment and uncomment;
  - Keyword and phrase completion--comes with dictionary file of E
    function templates--just type the function name and complete it;
    you'll now have the E function template in your source; two convenient
    methods of completion available; custom dictionaries supported, as
    well as an unlimited number of dictionaries available simultaneously;
  - Collect garbage on demand (or memory crisis); and other low-mem options;
  - Optional bottom scrollbar for those who like to have that extra
    line of text at the bottom;
  - Many small things that add to comfort and productivity that won't
    be mentioned for the sake of space and attention span :-)

@node "Installation"
@title "EE Installation"

                              Installation

  The following files must exist in the specified directories
  subordinate to the directory where the EE executable is located.
  OS2.0+ programmers may recognize this location as "PROGDIR:".  No ASSIGN
  ADDs or PATH ADDs are necessary (although it may be desirable to place
  the EE and PROGDIR:bin directories in your path).

  - Properly configured settings file (defaults provided) in directory
    PROGDIR:prefs; (location configurable; see @{" Preferences Files " link "Preferences Files"});
  - EE keyword completion file in PROGDIR:prefs; (location configurable
    @{" Completion Files " link "Completion Files"});
  - EE PrefsEditor program in PROGDIR;

  If you uncompress EE and preserve the archived directory structure,
  all you need to do is install reqtools.library in your LIBS: directory,
  and the fonts to your FONTS: directory.  Customization is possible, even
  desirable (see @{" Customization " link "Customization"}).  The included fonts E/11 and blerk/11
  and /9 are highly recommended.

@node "Preferences Files"
@title "EE Preferences Files"

                        EE Preferences Files

  EE Preferences files store configurable information needed by EE at
  startup.

  Without a preferences file EE would be dead in the water.  Rather than
  store a hunk of default info in the frequently used EE executable, I
  chose to put it in the less frequently used PrefsEditor program.  If
  you need to create a new Preferences file this can be done quite simply
  via the @{" PrefsEditor Program " link "PrefsEditor"}.

  The title of this section implies that you can have and use more than one
  Preferences file, and this is so.  There are four methods for selecting
  a Preferences file, two active and two passive:

    - (active) a PREFS argument provided on the command line overrides the
      passive methods;
    - (passive) the current directory is searched for a file named
      EE.prefs;
    - (passive) the directory PROGDIR:prefs is searched for a file named
      EE.prefs;
    - (active) The "Load Prefs" function can be accessed after startup via
      the menu, a key assignment, and/or EE's ARexx port;  NOTE: the
      following settings are frozen at startup and are not changed by
      loading new Preferences file:  1) presence/absence of the bottom
      scroller, 2) public screen preferences (except for Default and
      Shanghai modes), and 3) foreground and background colors;

@node "Completion Files"
@title "EE Completion Files"

                        EE Completion Files

    The file CompletionFiles exists in path PROGDIR:prefs.  This file
    consists of linefeed terminated strings.  It was created with EE and
    can be modified by EE.  The contents of this file contains the path and
    file names of the files that should be searched by the @(" Complete Block " link "Tools"}
    function.

    The default CompletionFiles file list points to the files
    PROGDIR:prefs/completions/E-Builtin-NoRtnVal and
    PROGDIR:prefs/completions/E-Builtin.

    The default completion files, like the default CompletionFiles file
    list consist of linefeed terminated strings.  The text of a completion
    file may say anything (as long as it's printable ascii).  The max
    allowable file size is virtually unlimited (i.e., only by AmigaDOS and
    how long you're willing to wait for a search).  The files' contents are
    stored on disk during runtime, not in memory.

    If you have already read the @{" Complete Block " link "Tools"} function description, you
    know that the Complete Block function searches the Completion file(s)
    for the first matching occurrence of the hilighted text, and if found,
    replaces the hilighted block with the entire line of text where the
    match is found.  You may edit the default files, or interchange your
    own files.  You must understand, however, that the search is case
    sensitive, and that when hilighting your text you much chose enough
    text to make the string unique, else you may suffer massive confusion
    when EE insists on replacing the selection with an unexpected string.

    If it helps your understanding of how to use this function, EE uses the
    dos.library function Fgets() to read in the lines of text, and the E
    function InStr() to check for a match.

    With some thought, you can easily set up your file entries to be
    unique and flexible.  As a sample, the two default completion files
    listed above contain the E builtin function templates.  The former file
    contains the function templates without return values, the latter
    function templates with return-values.  Functions with similar names
    are arranged internally from shorter to longer (e.g., Dispose() before
    DisposeLink(), String() before StringF()).  Now, because of the way I
    arranged the default completion file list, if I hilight the word
    "OpenS", it is replaced with:

      OpenS(width, height, depth, sflags, title, taglist)

    but if I hilight the word "=OpenS", it is replace with:

      sptr:=OpenS(width, height, depth, sflags, title, taglist)

    Another idea is to give "names" to lines of source code.  For example,
    a completion file entry could be the EasyRequestArgs() line from the
    EReq.e example program, with a comment tag on the end of it:

      EasyRequestArgs(0,[20,0,0,body,gadgets],0,args) ->EZREQ

    then when you complete "EZREQ", you get the source in it's place, and
    the tag is just a comment.

@title "EE PrefsEditor: In General"

                        EE PrefsEditor: In General

  The PrefsEditor program can be found in the directory PROGDIR:.

  The PrefsEditor command template is 'FILE,PUBSCREEN', where FILE is the
  optional name of the Preferences file to edit, and PUBSCREEN is the
  optional name of the public screen to visit.

  If FILE is not provided, default Preferences settings are used. In this
  case, the file is saved to T:EE.prefs if the 'Save' button is used to exit
  the program.  A requester is posted to notify you of the creation of the
  temporary file.  It is up to you to manually copy it to a suitable
  location for salvage.

  If PUBSCREEN is not provided, the Workbench screen is used.

  Three exit actions are available.

  - Choose 'Cancel' or the Close Window gadget to quit and discard changes.
  - Choose 'Save' to write the changes to the file specified on the command
    line (or T:EE.prefs if no file is specified on the command line).
  - Choose 'Use' if you invoked the Preferences editor from within EE and
    only wish to use the new settings for the current session.  Regardless
    of the command-line and where the PrefsEditor was launched from, the
    preferences will be written to file T:EE.prefs.

  NOTE:  PrefsEditor is a stand-alone utility, so you may run it from the
  CLI. You can run PrefsEditor from the CLI (or other program-launching
  utility) without affecting a currently running instance of EE.

  NOTE:  if you invoke the PrefsEditor from within EE and exit with the
  'Use' button, you can edit the current session's settings by invoking the
  PrefsEditor again from within EE.  The changes will be written back to the
  temporary file.  If afterwards you decide to save the temporary changes,
  you must manually copy T:EE.prefs to a suitable location.  Don't confuse
  this tip with normal operation...this is just contingent upon you choosing
  'Use' when you really meant 'Save'.

  NOTE:  to create a virgin preferences file, run PrefsEditor from the CLI
  with no args (well, PUBSCREEN is okay).  PrefsEditor will then be started
  up using default settings for all fields, and NO KEY ASSIGNMENTS.  You
  should choose "Save" at this point, then copy the file "T:EE.prefs" to a
  more permanent location.  Then restart PrefsEditor, this time supplying
  the new preferences filename you just created, and edit your key
  assignments and other settings according to the info in this guide.

@node "PE Commands"
@title "PrefsEditor:  Edit Commands"

                          PrefsEditor:  Edit Commands

  EE provides 5 slots for commands which can be executed from within the
  editor.  Since the commands are executed via the exec.library function
  SystemTagList(), you may set these to any valid string which will be
  recognized by your configured @{" Console " link "PE Global Settings"} (e.g., IO redirection).
@endnode

@node "PE Compiler"
@title "PrefsEditor:  Edit Compiler"

                         EE PrefsEditor:  Edit Compiler

  Command

    Enter the command line you would use to compile your project, omitting
    the project's filename.  The filename will be supplied by EE.  The
    default is "EC".  Another example is "EC SYM QUIET SOURCE=", assuming
    EC is in your path, in the current directory, aliased, or made
    resident(?).

    You may specify the full pathname for EC.

    Command is limited to 80 characters.

  Save Before Compiling

    Check this option if you want EE to save a modified project before
    invoking the compiler.

  Report Unreferenced

    Check this option if you want EE to display EC's reported "UNREFERENCED"
    identifiers.
@endnode

@node "PE Global Settings"
@title "PrefsEditor:  Edit Global Settings"

                       PrefsEditor:  Edit Global Settings

  Due to the size of the GUI, this function has been replaced by a bank of
  buttons labeled "Checked Settings...", "Public Screen...",
  "Miscellaneous...", and "Ok".


  Checked Settings GUI

    FG<->BG

      Check this if you want to swap the default colors FG=0, BG=1.


    Bottom Scroller

      Check this if you want EE to attach a horizontal scroller to the
      bottom border of its windows.


    Find Case Sensitive

      Check this if you want EE to start up in case-sensitive find mode.


    Insert Mode

      Check this if you want EE to start up in insert mode.


    Backup Project

      Check this if you want EE to backup your project file before saving
      a modified project.  Backed up files have the string '.bak' appended
      to their names and are stored under the same directory as the
      project. WARNING:  1) use foresight in naming your valuable backup
      files (i.e., don't name project 'foo.e' backup to 'foo.e.bak'; EE
      will overwrite it if this option is turned on); 2) leave enough room
      in your project filenames for the extension; your projects should be
      26 characters (including extension) long at most; if editing an EE
      backup file, it's backup file will be, for example, 'foo.e.bak.bak';
      this should be obvious.

      This feature requires the AmigaDOS Copy command to be in your path,
      aliased, or resident.


    No Fold When Loading

      Don't fold a project upon loading it, even if has fold info.

      WARNING:  saving a project after loading in this fashion will lose
      all of it's fold info.  Your only hope in such a case is to be using
      the Backup option, or be fortunate enough to have an ARexx script
      that will intelligently fold your project back up.


    Free-form Cursor

      Check this if you want EE to start up in Free-form Cursor mode.  See
      @{" Free-form Cursor Mode" link "Settings"}.

    Justify Newline

      Determines whether you want EE to smart-indent newlines.


  Public Screen Settings GUI

    Public Screen Name

      Enter the name of the public screen that EE will open and/or visit.
      The default name is 'Workbench'.


    Default

      Check this if you want EE to become the default public screen at
      startup.  When other programs call LockPubScreen(NIL), the Default
      Public Screen is locked.  This option causes other applications to
      that ask for the Default Public Screen in this fashion to lock the
      EE screen.  Many applications use this feature to decide which screen
      their windows will open on.


    Shanghai

      Check this if you want EE to become a Shanghai screen at startup.  When
      other applications expect to open on the Workbench screen, this mode
      causes them open on EE's screen instead.


    New

      Check this if you want EE to attempt to open a new public screen at
      startup.  The screen name is the one you specify in the Public Screen
      Name string gadget.


    Visit

      Check this if you want EE to visit the public screen specified in the
      Public Screen Name string gadget.  If New is checked and EE fails to
      open the new public screen because a screen of that name is already
      open (e.g., by another EE), EE will attempt to visit that screen.  If
      New is not checked and the named screen isn't already opened, then
      Visit will fail.


    Fallback

      Check this if you want EE to attempt to Fallback to the Workbench
      screen if New and/or Visit public screen operations fail.  Note: these
      three options obviously take the precedence New, Visit, Fallback.  If
      one is missing, the next lower-precedence option is used.  If Fallback
      is missing and New and Visit fail, EE will abort.


  Miscellaneous Settings GUI

    Completions

      The name of the Completion Files file list.  (The file containing
      the names of files to be searched by the @(" Complete Block " link "Tools"}
      function. See also:  @{" Completion Files " link "Completion Files"}.


    Indent

      Enter the number of spaces to insert by an @{" Indent " link "Edit"} operation.


    Tab

      Enter the number of spaces to expand tabs when loading a file.  The
      default is 8.


    Fold Extra Lines

      Enter the number of blank lines to fold after a fold terminator.  Useful
      for readability, i.e., if Fold Extra Lines is 1, the following unfolded
      source:

        PROC foo()
          doFoo()
        ENDPROC

        PROC bar()
          doBar()
        ENDPROC

        PROC hooHah() IS $F00D

      ...folds to:

        >>PROC foo()
        >>PROC bar()
        PROC anotherServing() IS $F00D

      There are two special values which affect folding of functions and
      objects:  -1 and -2.

      -1 will fold all but the ENDPROC line, so the return values will remain
      visible:

        PROC wutsup()
          lotsa_stuff()
        ENDPROC this,that,theOther

      ...becomes:

        >>PROC wutsup()
        ENDPROC this,that,theOther

      With a setting of -1, objects' ENDOBJECT keyword are folded, and no
      trailing blank lines are folded.

      -2 will fold all but the ENDPROC line, the same as -1.  The difference
      is that objects' ENDOBJECT keyword plus one blank line will be folded.

      NOTE:  comments are NOT blank lines, and therefore will disable the
      Fold Extra Lines feature.

    Window:  L, T, H, W

      Window Left, Top, Height, and Width at startup.

    Console Spec

      The con specification string to use for opening a console as output.
      For example:  'KCON:20/20/100/600/Mega Output Console/WAIT/AUTO/SCREEN'
      NOTE:  the SCREEN parameter MUST always be supplied, and MUST always be
      last.  The screen name should be left out since EE will automatically
      use the public screen name specified in the Public Screen Name string
      gadget (or the Workbench screen if EE 'falls back').

    Font Name, Size

      Just like it says.  The font must be a black and white, fixed width,
      non-scaled font, else it will screw up.  Obviously, some fonts will be
      better than others.  The supplied E/11 and blerk/11 and 9 fonts are
      provided for your reading bliss. :-)

  The small utility @{" ListKeys " link "ListKeys"} has be provided to allow you to view what
  functions are bound to your keys.


  DEAD KEYS ACCENTS
  -----------------

  You can assign the 'deadkeys' (Alt-F thru Alt-K) by selecting 'Write Char',
  then pressing the key combinations Alt-F thru Alt-K.  This is all that's
  required to get 'deadkey' accents in EE.


  "<" AND ">" PASTING FROM PowerSnap
  ----------------------------------

  I finally figured out why EE doesn't like to paste "<" and ">" when
  PowerSnap sends them.  It's because EE binds the characters to Shift-"<"
  and Shift-">" and PowerSnap passes the characters without the qualifier.
  TO ASSIGN PowerSnap's "<" and ">" characters to EE's "Write Char" function,
  start PrefsEditor, click on "Assign Keys" button, choose "Write Char" from
  the left listview, then using PowerSnap cut-n-paste a "<" and a ">".

                          The ListKeys Utility

  This is a small and very simple CLI utility that will read an EE Prefs
  file and display a list of keys that have functions bound to them.

  Keys are listed as one of the combinations:

        NONE keyname  functionname
       SHIFT keyname  functionname
        CTRL keyname  functionname
         ALT keyname  functionname
    RCOMMAND keyname  functionname
    LCOMMAND keyname  functionname

  where keyname is the alphanumeric name of the Vanilla ASCII code, and
  functionname is the name of the function as they appear in the AssignKeys
  gui of the PrefsEditor.

  The command template is 'FILE/A,HEX/S,SHOWALL/S' where:

    FILE     name of the Preferences file to examine;
    HEX      display the hexadecimal key value (default is alphanumeric);
    SHOWALL  force display of keys bound to function "Write Char" (default
             is NOT to show these bindings, which are usually numerous);
@endnode

@node "PE Menu Command Hotkeys"
@title "PrefsEditor:  Edit Menu Command Hotkeys"

                  PrefsEditor:  Edit Menu Command Hotkeys

  Very straightforward.  Enter the character you want intuition to display
  in the function's menu item.  This character is bound to the Right-Amiga
  Command key and invokes the function when that key combination is
  pressed.  Since Intuition intercepts these key codes before they are
  passed as Rawkeys, a character entered here overrides any assignment of
  this key combination via the @{" Key Assignments Editor " link "PE Key Assignments"}.
  Conflicts between commands assigned here and command assigned via the
  @{" Key Assignments Editor " link "PE Key Assignments"} are not prevented
  by this interface.

  Conflicts between Menu Items are, however, prevented.  Which is to say,
  you can't enter an "N" for menu items "New Window" and "Next Window"; the
  latter attempted assignment will cause a requester to appear, and the
  assignment will be ignored (even though the value appears to remain in the
  gadget.)

  EE's menus are CASE-SENSITIVE. =)  For instance, I like RCommand-e for
  'Compile', and Rcommand-E for 'Compile and Run'.

    Function Name   Description

    Clear*          Abandon current window's text, but do not close window.

    Open*           Abandon current window's text and request another file
                    to load.

    Open New*       Open a new window and request a file to load.  See note
                    1 for a tip.

    New Window*     Open a new window.  See note 1 for a tip.

    Save*           Save current window's text to the file named in the
                    window's title bar.

    SaveAs*         Save current window's text to a file different than the
                    file named in the window's title bar.

    Quit*           Abandon current window's text and close the window.


    * Function accessible via menu.

    Note 1:  when a new window is opened, it inherits the current path from
    the window from which it was launched.  You can take advantage of this
    feature by switching to a window whose path is nearest to the directory
    where you want to load or create your file.  If you have monster paths
    on your harddrive like me, you'll appreciate not having to bash the
    file requester to get to distant places from the startup directory all
    the time. ;-)

    Jump Left             Shift text right by one half screen width.

    Jump Right            Shift text left by one half screen width.

    Beginning Of Line     Move cursor to beginning of current line.
                          Repeated invocation toggles cursor between
                          leftmost non-blank character and column 1.

    End Of Line           Move cursor immediately after last character in
                          current line.

    Down                  Move cursor down one line.

    Up                    Move cursor up one line.

    Scroll Down           Scroll text down one line.

    Scroll Up             Scroll text up one line.

    Page Down             Scroll text up one full page.

    Page Up               Scroll text down one full page.

    Jump To Bottom        Go to last page of text.

    Jump To Top           Go to first page of text.

    Goto Line*            Go to specific line number.

    Goto Last Error*      Go to line number at which last compilation error
                          occurred.  (If the erroneous line is within a
                          fold, this function positions the cursor at the
                          fold header.  By repeatedly unfolding and
                          invoking this function you will eventually arrive
                          at the erroneous line.)

                         name.  This action is inherent to 'Replace'.

    Replace*             Request search-text and replacement-text, search
                         forward for next occurrence of search-text,
                         replace it, then search again.  This function will
                         pick up hilighted text and use it as search-text.

    Replace Backwards*   Request search-text and replacement-text, search
                         backwards for previous occurrence of search-text,

@title "EE Editing Functions"

                      EE Editing Functions


    Function Name       Description
    -----------------   -----------

    Write Char          Normally self-explanatory, but when a block of text
                        is selected, the character typed is searched for
                        (forward), and the block is extended up to and
                        including the typed character.

    Open Line           Move cursor down one line and insert a blank line.
                        Justify cursor with leftmost character of previous
                        line.

    Delete Line         Delete current line.

    Dupe Line*          Duplicate current line and insert it immediately
                        after.

    Split Line          Split current line at cursor location and insert
                        the splinter immediately after current line;
                        justify splinter with leftmost character of
                        parent line, leaving cursor at that location.

    Join Line           Join current line with next line, leaving cursor at
                        location of the joint.

    Indent              Similar in functionality to tabs, simply inserts
                        number of spaces required to position cursor at
                        next (multiple of IndentWidth)+1.

    Back Space          Move cursor left and delete character under cursor.
                        When cursor is in column 1, this function moves the
                        cursor up one line and performs a "Join Line".

    Comment*            Comment a hilighted block of text.

    Uncomment*          Comment a hilighted block of text.

    Delete              Delete character under cursor.  When cursor is
                        beyond end of current line, this function performs
                        a "Join Line".

    Delete Word Left    Deletes all characters left of cursor until a
                        beginning of word is encountered.  If the cursor
                        encroaches the top 1/3 of the view, the view is
                        automatically scrolled.

    Delete Word Right   Deletes all characters from character under cursor
                        until an end of word is encountered.  If the cursor
                        encroaches the bottom 1.3 of the view, the view is
                        automatically scrolled.

    Delete Left         Deletes all characters left of cursor to beginning
                        of current line.  If cursor is in column 1, the
                        current line is joined to the previously line.

    Delete Right        Deletes all characters from character under cursor
                        to end of current line.

    To Upper*           Changes case of a single character to upper.  If
                        the character being converted is the last character
                        in the line, the cursor jumps to the next non-blank
                        character.  If a block of text is hilighted, the
                        entire block of text is converted to uppercase.

    To Lower*           Changes case of a single character to lower.  If
                        the character being converted is the last character
                        in the line, the cursor jumps to the next non-blank
                        character.  If a block of text is hilighted, the
                        entire block of text is converted to lowercase.

    Save Before Compiling*
                          Toggle SAVE/NOSAVE mode.  Checked menu item
                          signifies SAVE FILE (if modified) before invoking
                          compiler.

    Backup Project*       Toggle BACKUP/NOBACKUP mode.  Checked menu item
                          signifies BACKUP mode for <file> to <file>.bak
                          before saving.

    Report Unreferenced*  Toggle REPORT/SILENCE mode of EC warnings about
                          unreferenced variables.  Checked menu item
                          signifies REPORT mode.

    No Fold When Loading* Toggle REGARD/DISREGARD fold info when loading.
                          Checked menu item signifies REGARD mode.

    Default Pub Screen*   Make EE screen default public screen.  Checked
                          menu item signifies that EE screen IS the
                          default public screen.  When other programs call
                          LockPubScreen(NIL), the Default Public Screen is
                          locked.  This option causes other applications to
                          that ask for the Default Public Screen in this
                          fashion to lock the EE screen.

    Shanghai Pub Screen*  Make EE screen a shanghai public screen.  Checked
                          menu item signifies that EE screen IS a shanghai
                          public screen.  When other applications expect to
                          open on the Workbench screen, this mode causes
                          them to open on EE's screen instead.

    Free-form Cursor*     Toggle FREE-FORM/STREAM mode.  Checked menu item
                          signifies FREE-FORM (page) mode.  This affects
                          the behavior of the cursor.  STREAM mode
                          restricts the cursor to the region of extent
                          text, and wraps around at beginning of line and
                          end of line.  When scrolling, if the cursor comes
                          to rest beyond end of line, it is yanked to the
                          end-of-line position for that line.  FREE-FORM
                          mode allows the cursor to roam wherever a
                          character may exist, even out to position 1024,
                          and even if there is no text out that far.

    Fast File Loading*    Fast file loading is twice as fast as normal file
                          loading.  It is really only noticable when
                          loading large files.  Normal loading is very
                          memory efficient, while fast loading requires
                          memory more than twice the size of the file:
                          storage for the file buffer, plus storage for the
                          editor data structures and line buffers.  The
                          buffer is freed when loading is complete.  NOTE:
                          you cannot use fast loading for devices which
                          store compressed data and decompress the data
                          when it is read (XPK, EPU, CompressDisk) unless
                          the device can report the "virtual" size of the
                          file.  Otherwise, a partial load will result.

    Justify Newline       Toggles smart-indentation of new lines.

    Fold Extra Lines*     Set number of blank lines to fold after keywords
                          ENDPROC and ENDOBJECT.  NOTE:  comments are NOT
                          blank lines, and therefore will disable this
                          feature.  For an explanation of the special values
                          -1 and -2, see @{" Global Settings " link "PE Global Settings"}.

    Indent Width*         Set indent width.

    Tab Width*            Set tab width (NOTE:  Tab Width only matters when
                          loading files).

                          Press the key sequence that will invoke playback
                          of the macro; then perform the operations you

                      EE Tools Functions


    Function Name       Description
    -------------       -----------

    Fold/Unfold*        The folding function has two ways of determining
                        the boundaries of a fold:  1) fold the currently
                        hilighted lines of text; 2) fold the text existing
                        between the current line and the next forward
                        occurring end-of-fold keyword.

                        Keywords MUST begin in column 1.  Keyword recogni-
                        tion is as follows:
                        1) if current line begins with "PROC" or "EXPORT
                           PROC", text is folded until next occurrence of
                           "ENDPROC", or end of text;
                        2) if current line begins with "OBJECT" or "EXPORT
                           OBJECT", text is folded until next occurrence of
                           "ENDOBJECT", or end of text;
                        3) lastly, text is folded from current line to next
                           occurrence of "->endfold", or end of text.  This
                           keyword string MUST appear EXACTLY as it appears
                           here, or it won't be recognized.

                        A fold is indicated by a "fold header", a line
                        flagged by the prefix ">>".  Enfolded text is hidden
                        from searching, but fold headers can be searched
                        for.

                        A fold header(s) can be copied and pasted all or in
                        part, but it is otherwise protected against being
                        edited.  A copied fold header does not take with it
                        a copy of the folded text; the header is pasted with
                        the prefix changed to "->".

                        An entire fold(s) can be cut and pasted one time;
                        all enfolded text is moved with the "fold header".
                        Subsequent pastings only paste the header with the
                        prefix changed to "->"; the enfolded text is not
                        duplicated.

                        Folds may be nested as deeply as desired.

                        Folds are saved as an ascii comment at the end of a
                        source file so as not to clutter the source when
                        viewed with other tools.  Safeguards exist to handle
                        damaged fold info, but results are unpredictable
                        should this info become damaged.  If damage occurs
                        you can use the command line option NOFOLD to tell
                        EE to ignore this info.  This option is also avail-
                        able via menu, and assignable via the key binding
                        utility.

    Next Window*        Bring next EE window to front.

    Previous Window*    Bring previous EE window to front.

    Goto Window*        Popup listview to choose a window to bring to front.

    Tall Window*        Toggle between normal window size and full height of
                        visible screen.  (This means if the screen is pulled
                        down halfway, the window will stretch only half the
                        screen's height.)

    Complete Block*     Search the Completion file list for a match of the
                        hilighted text, and replace the hilighted text with
                        its completion.  See @{" Block Editing Functions " link "Block Editing Functions"} and
                        @{" Completion Files " link "Completion Files"}.

    Compile*            Use the compile command string to invoke the E
                        compiler for the file in the current window.

    Goto Last Error*    Go to the line containing the error from the last
                        compiler invocation.  If the line is enfolded, the
                        cursor is placed at the fold header containing the
                        line.  You can unfold text and invoke this command
                        repeatedly until the offending line is reached.

    Execute*            Open a console window and execute one of the five
                        command strings.  If a block of text is hilighted,
                        the hilighted text is picked up and used by the
                        function.  Commands are always displayed in a
                        string requester so you can edit them before
                        proceeding.  Changes to a command are not retained
                        unless they are changed via the Edit Commands
                        function.

    Show Editor Info*   Show some pertinent information:  EE Arexx port
                        name, EE public screen name.

                      EE Block Editing Functions


    Function Name         Description
    -------------         -----------

    Mark Block*           Begin hilighting a block of text.  If a block is
                          already being marked, the block is turned off.
                          Blocks can be marked via clicking and dragging
                          mouse.

    Adjust Block          Any editor traversal function will adjust a block
                          including Finds.  The combination Shift-key+
                          Click-and-Drag mouse will also adjust a block.
                          Mouse and keyboard manipulation maybe be inter-
                          changed indefinitely.  Typing a character will
                          extend a block forward up to and including the
                          next occurrence of the typed character (see
                          function @{" Write Char " link "Edit"}).

    Cancel Block          Invoke function Mark Block a second time, or
                          invoke the function Cancel Block, which is
                          assignable via the key binding utility.

    Cut Block*            Extract hilighted text and store temporarily in a
                          "cut buffer".

    Copy Block*           Copy hilighted text and store temporarily in a
                          "cut buffer".

    Paste Block*          Insert contents of "cut buffer" into text.

    Copy Block To Find String
                          Pick up text in currently hilighted block and
                          place it in the search-text buffer for use in the
                          next search operation.

    Copy Block To Replace String
                          Pick up text in currently hilighted block and
                          place it in the replacement-text buffer for use in
                          the next replace operation.

    Auto Cut              Hilighted block of text is automatically cut when
                          an editing function (Backspace, Delete, Paste,
                          etc.) is invoked.  Block can be retrieved using
                          the Undo function.  See note below.

    Undo*                 See note below.

    Complete Block*       @{" Complete Block Usage " link "Tools"} @{" Completion Files " link "Completion Files"}


    * Function accessible via menu.

    Note:  functions Auto Cut and Undo are related in the way of Cut Block
    and Paste Block.  A major consideration is that separate storage is
    used for each of these two classes of clippings.  Consequently, you can
    Region Cut a region and Auto Cut (via the backspace key, or whatever)
    another region, and then Region Paste and Undo as often as desired...
    very handy in cases requiring mildly complex duplication of text.  In
    addition, complex deletions (i.e., Delete Line, Delete Word Left, Delete
    Word Right, Delete Left, and Delete Right) are placed in the Undo
    buffer, and can therefore be Undone as long as no other Auto Cut
    operations have been performed.  NOTE:  Auto Cut does not work for the
    function @{" Write Char " link "Edit"}.

                          EE Arexx Overview


  BRIEF

    A valid ARexx script skeleton is:

      /* ARexx script skeleton: */
      ADDRESS EE.0
      OPTIONS RESULTS
      'lockwindow'
      /* ARexx code and EE commands... */
      'unlockwindow'

    This sets up a rendezvous with instance 0 of EE, locks the active
    window, performs actions, then unlocks the window.  A virtually
    unlimited number of instances of EE may run concurrently, named EE.0,
    EE.1, EE.2, ...  You can find the port name of an instance of EE by
    selecting the 'Show Editor Info' menu item in the 'Tools' menu.

    EE ARexx commands are parsed using the dos.library function ReadArgs().
    The general command template is 'CMD/A,ARG1,ARG2,ARG3,REP=REPEAT/K/N'.
    Commands may be abbreviated, may take arguments (including a repetition
    specifier), and may return a Result String, all in accordance with
    their descriptions in section @{" ARexx Functions " link "ARexx Functions"}.


  RENDEZVOUS WITH EE's AREXX PORT

    EE's ARexx port name follows the naming convention EE.x, where the name
    extension 'x' is a number starting with 0 and continuing to the maximum
    integer the computer will support.  Each instance of EE will take the
    lowest available digit as it's name extension.  You must establish
    contact with an EE ARexx port, by using the following line in your
    script:

      ADDRESS EE.x

    where, once again, 'x' is the number which corresponds to the instance
    of EE.  You can find EE's ARexx port name by selecting the 'Show Editor
    Info' menu item in the 'Tools' menu.


  INITIATING AN AREXX COMMAND SESSION

    An ARexx command session must be initiated by issuing the command
    'lockwindow'.  This tells EE to hold the active window, ignoring all
    events except those coming from it's ARexx port.  If your script has
    locked the active window, then issues a window-related command
    ('newwindow', 'opennew', 'nextwindow', 'previouswindow', or
    'closewindow') the lock is transferred to the succeeding window.
    (NOTE:  AutoPoint and other SunMouse-type utilities automatically
    change EE's active window, and hence EE's active project.  This is not
    surprising.  Therefore, you must take care not to inadvertently activate
    another window with the mouse if switching to the shell to execute your
    ARexx script.  Locking the window precludes any such problems during
    script execution, but it provides no protection prior to locking the
    window!)

  TERMINATING AN AREXX COMMAND SESSION

    An ARexx command session must be terminated by issuing the command
    'unlockwindow'.  This tells EE to release the active window and return
    to normal event processing.  NOTE:  the 'unlockwindow' command does not
    necessarily have to be issued in the same script as the 'lockwindow'
    command.  You could very well have one script to lock, one to unlock,
    and a collection of scripts that just perform actions on an already
    locked window.


  ABOUT EE AREXX COMMANDS

    Commands are not case sensitive.  The maximum command length supported
    by EE is 512 bytes (512 characters).

    The significant length of a command (it's abbreviation) is determined
    by the number of letters required to make a command name unique.  This
    is a side-effect of the method used to parse the command name.  It's
    your choice to take advantage of the abbreviations.  But note well that
    in a future release if ARexx commands are added whose abbreviations
    clash with existing abbreviations, your scripts may become obsolete
    because of the need to lengthen an abbreviation.  Something like this
    may happen if you use the full name, anyway, but it is not as likely.

    Commands may or may not take arguments.  The number and types are
    indicated for each command listed in the section @{" ARexx Functions " link "ARexx Functions"}.
    EE's command parser is the dos.library function ReadArgs(), so it
    should be no surprise that commands take on the form of a CLI command-
    line.

    The general command template is 'CMD/A,ARG1,ARG2,ARG3,REP=REPEAT/K/N',
    where:  CMD is always required; ARG1, ARG2, and ARG3 are required only
    in the context of a particular command; and REPEAT is the number of
    times to repeat the command, e.g., 'cursorright REP=20'.

    As in CLI command-lines, you may optionally specify the formal name of
    the argument, e.g., 'cmd=writestring rep=5 arg1="ha"'.

    Note that the template dictates that the keyword REP or REPEAT must
    always accompany the repetition argument.  the REP argument is honoured
    by almost every command, but is obviously only useful with certain
    commands.  For example, it makes sense to use REP with 'cursorleft',
    but not with 'gotoline' (how many times do you want to go to that line,
    ay? :-)  REP is treated as 1 if omitted.  REP less than 1 is usually
    not permitted, and is treated as 1.  Some special commands allow REP=0.
    This is indicated in the section @{" ARexx Functions " link "ARexx Functions"}.

    Some commands return a Result String.  This is indicated in the section
    @{" ARexx Functions " link "ARexx Functions"}.
