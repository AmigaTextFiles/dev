Subject: The AmigaE Mailing List Admin FAQ (Monthly)

AMIGAE MAILING LIST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS POSTING

Written 1/1/94.  Last update 1/1/94.

Administrative Stuff:
=====================

This file will be posted to amigae on a monthly basis. This FAQ 
only covers administrative questions, not those about programming 
with AmigaE. 

I really haven't had time to do much more than organize the basic 
question list of a programming FAQ, and it doesn't look like I'll 
have time to finish that, much less compile answers, anytime soon. 
If anyone out there would like to volunteer to compile and keep 
the FAQ, please let me know and I'll send you the message archives 
that seem to be most applicable. 

Just as a reminder, there is one basic rule that is applicable to 
any mailing list you may belong to:

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER SEND PERSONAL MAIL (for me or anyone else) 
TO AMIGAE. The amigae address is for group discussions of the 
AmigaE programming language and environment. Please keep in mind 
that everything posted to AmigaE goes out to over 150 people, 
many of whom pay for their email and do not appreciate receiving 
someone else's personal mail. No matter how clever your response 
may be, if it is to one person only please use individual email 
to deliver it. 

General Information:
====================

We now have over 150 members on the list.  We get a lot of quick 
drop in/drop outs, but the list has been steadily growing since 
its inception in May of 1993. List members are from all over the 
world, with the bulk being in the U.S., Germany, and the U.K. 
(though lots of other places are represented as well). 

Description of the list:

I created the AmigaE mailing list in May of 1993 to serve as a 
forum for those using the Amiga E programming language. The 
purpose was and is to put together experts and beginners alike 
for the exchange of coding ideas, source code and tools toward 
the dual goals of helping the Amiga E language to grow into 
maturity, and to help each of us grow into better Amiga E 
programmers. In these last six months, I believe that this list 
has served both of these goals well.

AmigaE was, at first, a mailing list administered by hand (by me). 
It was quite time consuming, and I know that I frustrated several 
users at times with my failure to find time to really address all 
the many questions I get each week about the list. So those of 
you who have written to me with administrative questions and 
requests might better understand why this can take longer than 
you would like, consider that I get over 50 messages to the 
amigae-request address each week, nearly all of them requiring 
a response or action. Since I have a full-time job, am also a 
full-time graduate student, and administer other lists as well, 
you might understand how things slowed to a crawl at times.

In the hopes of solving this problem, amigae is now a listserv 
robot that can take most of this pressure off and allow me time to 
actually participate in the list myself! It's been a long time 
since I've had the opportunity to do that. 

The amigae listserv is a mixture of my own software and some 
provided by the recent release of Peti's Amiga Listserv software. 
It understands most, but not all, of the commands found in the 
listserv set. It certainly can handle all the important ones. 
Another nice advantage of this is that finally I have fixed the 
software which sets the Reply-To header in all list postings to 
the list address. That might make things a bit easier for those 
of you that have complained about the failure of this feature 
to work on many of the list messages.

Addresses for the AmigaE Mailing List:
======================================

Much of this has changed. PLEASE READ.

1) amigae@bkhouse.cts.com - goes to everybody on the list. No 
changes here.

2) amigae-request@bkhouse.cts.com - used to go to me, now it is 
redirected to the listserv robot and expects listserv commands to 
be in the message body. If the message does not have such commands 
(as will probably be the case for many new subscribers who haven't 
yet found out about the changes) a cheerful and helpful file will 
be mailed to you.

3) nkraft@bkhouse.cts.com or nkraft@ucsd.edu - these go to the 
same mailbox, eventually. Mail to these addresses goes to me. 
That's fine for chatting and responses to anything that I might 
post as a member of the list, but PLEASE SEND ALL ADMINISTRATIVE 
(NON-LISTSERV) MAIL TO amigae-admin@bkhouse.cts.com (below).

4) amigae-admin@bkhouse.cts.com - this is the correct address to 
use for inquiries that cannot be solved with the listserv. If you 
are having problems with your address, or have a general 
administrative question about the list, send it here. DO NOT SEND 
IT TO AMIGAE!

5) listserv@bkhouse.cts.com - this is the address that all 
listserv commands should be sent to. The address amigae-request 
is now redirected here. The commands understood by the listserv 
are as follows:

HELP  
      Fetches a friendly, cheerful help file about how to use 
      the listserv (at least I hope its friendly and cheerful, 
      or at lease helpful). This should probably be the first 
      command you send to listserv@bkhouse.cts.com.

LIST [address]
      Lists all mailing lists to which the given address is 
      subscribed.

INDEX 
      Lists all the lists available for subscription. I do run 
      a few other mailing lists at this site. Most of them don't 
      have much to do with computers or programming, but they 
      might be interesting to some of you. It will take me a 
      couple of weeks to get all the lists converted to using 
      the listserv, so this command may not be all that 
      illuminating for a while yet.

SUBSCRIBE [address] listname
UNSUBSCRIBE [address] listname
      This is how you join or resign from the AmigaE Mailing 
      List. Please get the syntax right: the software isn't very 
      forgiving. For example:

      SUBSCRIBE Joe Smith AmigaE    will *not* get you on the list. 
      SUBSCRIBE joe@abc.edu         will get you on the list.
      SUBSCRIBE AmigaE              will also get you on the list.

FAQ listname
      Sends the "Frequently Asked Questions" (if available) for 
      the indicated mailing list. For example, "FAQ AmigaE" returns 
      the file you're reading now.

A listserv command must be the first word on each line in the 
message. Generally, when mailing to the listserv, you can leave 
the Subject: header blank, as it is ignored.

6) postmaster@bkhouse.cts.com - this goes to the me again. I'm 
the sysadmin, postmaster, etc, of this site.

If you need to get in touch with me, and the address you've 
chosen doesn't get an immediate response, please be patient. 
Sometimes it takes me a while to find the time to answer your 
question properly. If all else fails, you can call my voicemail 
at 619-526-0344, but it better be pretty darn important!

Bounces--Keeping Track of Where You Are:
========================================

A "bounce" is mail that is not received by the recipient, and 
therefore gets returned to the sender.  If the mail is being 
sent to you as part of the amigae address, the "sender" is 
supposed to be set up so that such bounces go to me directly. 
They shouldn't go to you, but sometimes they do. I try to 
resolve these as quickly as possible.

You can help by remembering to UNSUBSCRIBE when you are about 
to lose or change your account. You can always resubscribe 
later. The listserv that I use allows you to UNSUBSCRIBE 
from your new address, if necessary. Use the HELP command to 
find out how.

Unfortunately, the single largest cause of bounces is not 
dead or changed accounts, it's machines (or routing servers) 
that are down or otherwise not accepting mail.  Neither 
you nor I can do anything about this. Sometimes when a 
machine is in one of these fits, the bounce will say that 
the machine is okay but the user doesn't exist. Later, 
everything will get better. It's annoying, and it's why 
I don't remove list members with bounces for a week or so.

Another reason I get bounces is an account that has exceeded
its disk space allocation.  If your mailbox is full, you can 
not receive any new mail.

Archives:
=========

I concatenate each month's posts into files and put them into 
an FTP directory at wuarchive.wustl.edu (/pub/aminet/dev/e). 
This directory also a lot of other great Amiga E stuff, so if 
you haven't had a look at it yet, please do!

These message archives are put up at the end of each month 
(or at least that is my often-missed goal). If you find that 
the AmigaE list traffic is too much for your machine, this 
can be a good way to keep up on what the list is doing. I 
have not been particularly good about keeping up on these 
lately, but the whole process is automated now so you might 
find that the archives will be available much faster than 
they have been.


Also, I have gathered together all the binaries posted in 
the first three months of the list into a binary-only 
archive of lha'd files that have been decoded for you and 
checked to be sure that they uncompress without errors. 
This file is a single lha archive containing many other 
lha archives. These are in the FTP directory now, and 
will shortly be joined by another file with the last 
three months worth of binaries (there have been very few). 
In general, I'll keep up the binary archive on a 
quarterly basis, unless there are enough binaries posted 
to the list to warrant an early release.

Finally, I have put together an archive of the source 
postings that have appeared during the first three months 
of the list. I am also in the process of creating another 
with the last three months of sources (again, there 
haven't been many). I must warn readers that the contents 
of this archive are somewhat arbitrary. With a list 
dedicated to a programming language, there is a *lot* of 
code posted in varying lengths from one line to whole 
programs. My initial criteria for inclusion in the source 
archive was that the source be a complete module or 
procedure that would compile on the first try. You'll 
find that I made a few exceptions for code that looked 
like it might be particularly useful, but wasn't quite 
up to those standards. Each source in this archive is 
complete, with the original mail headers and any prefacing 
or trailing remarks. 

Specific Questions About the AmigaE Mailing List:
=================================================

1.  Where can I get Amiga E?

The best place is via FTP on AmiNet:

USA (MO)     ftp.wustl.edu         128.252.135.4  pub/aminet/dev/e
USA (TX)     ftp.etsu.edu          192.43.199.20  pub/aminet/dev/e
USA (CA)     ftp.cdrom.com         192.153.46.2   pub/aminet/dev/e
Scandinavia  ftp.luth.se           130.240.18.2   pub/aminet/dev/e
Germany      ftp.uni-kl.de         131.246.9.95   pub/aminet/dev/e
Germany      ftp.uni-erlangen.de   131.188.1.43   pub/aminet/dev/e
Germany      ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de   130.149.17.7   pub/aminet/dev/e
Germany      ftp.th-darmstadt.de   130.83.55.75   pub/aminet/dev/e
Germany      ftp.uni-paderborn.de  131.234.2.32   pub/aminet/dev/e
Germany      ftp.uni-oldenburg.de  134.106.40.9   pub/aminet/dev/e
Switzerland  ftp.eunet.ch          changing       pub/aminet/dev/e
Switzerland  litamiga.epfl.ch      128.178.151.32 pub/aminet/dev/e
UK           src.doc.ic.ac.uk      146.169.2.1    pub/aminet/dev/e
Australia    splat.aarnet.edu.au   192.107.107.6  pub/aminet/dev/e


Any of these sites carry the most recent FTP-able version 
of the Amiga E compiler. There are also a lot of pretty neat 
Amiga E utilities and sample sources there, too, as well as 
the AmigaE Mailing List archives.

2.  There is too much traffic on this list to keep up.

Yes, this has been a complaint I've heard many times, and 
seems to be a problem for many people. If you haven't 
been a subscriber for very long, you might want to stay 
around a month or so before making a decision about 
leaving the list. This is a very variable list: when it 
started, there was about 300K per month in list traffic, 
for the last two or three months, it has been something 
more like 30K per month. There does seem to be a cyclical 
nature to list traffic, revolving around school breaks, 
holidays, etc., but nothing that could be used 
predictively. Anyway, there are times when we get 20 or 
30 messages a day, and others when we get 20 messages a 
month. It might be worth staying on the list long enough 
to get a really good feel for the average traffic level. 

If even the average is too much, you can always get the 
archives from the FTP directories, and keep up that way. 
It isn't as current, but you won't miss anything. Doing 
this, you can still post to the list by sending messages 
to amigae@bkhouse.cts.com, you just won't get any mail 
from the list. Be sure to note in such messages that 
you are not a list member and need a personal reply.

3.  There is too little traffic on this list -- Am I even 
    on the list?

This could be caused by a down period in list traffic, or 
it could be the result of problems with your address. 
Stay with the list for a week or so and, if you still don't 
see any messages, let me know and I'll check out your 
address. I get this complaint fairly often, and it is 
usually just a matter of waiting a few more days.

4.  This group is useless to me because no one wants to 
    talk about the things that I want to talk about.

It seems to me that people here have been pretty helpful 
on just about every topic. If your posts are not generating 
the responses you desire, try restating what you have said. 
If you have specific programming questions, try to post 
some source with it. That makes helping you a lot easier 
for all of us.

5.  This group is useless to me because the discussion is 
    too technical, not technical enough, too tools oriented, 
    not tools oriented enough, create-your-own-problem-here.

The level of discussion in any particular area will vary. If 
it seems too technical for you, just be honest and say so! 
We really do want you to benefit from using this list, and 
I hope that members would be happy to talk to you at an 
appropriate level. Conversely, if the discussions are not 
high level enough for you, please understand that not all 
of our members are professional programmers, or deeply 
knowledgable about the Amiga or Amiga E. Keep track of the 
other members who are at your level, and try to involve 
them in your discussions, either publicly or privately.

6.  What are the posting guidelines for messages, source 
    and binaries?

Okay, no one actually ever asks this question, but I wish 
they did! Anyway, I wrote these last summer and here they 
are:

                   Posting guidelines

1. Try to keep in mind that your posts to the list go out 
to over 150 people located around the world. Many of these 
pay for their email services, and international email is in 
general an expensive enterprise for someone along the line, 
even if not for the end user. If your posting is of a 
personal nature, or is part of a discussion with just one 
or two list members, consider using private email to 
continue the dialog. Always be aware that what you post to 
the list should be of interest to the majority of list 
members.

2. Stay on topic! This list is for the discussion of Amiga E.

3. Please try to be polite in both your posts and your 
responses. Flaming (though we haven't seen much here, yet), 
will not be tolerated and can get a member removed from the 
list in a hurry. It has no place in a forum such as this 
one.

4. If you choose to reply to a list message, be sure to 
trim quoted text as much as possible. Again, this is a 
matter of courtesy as both members who pay for mail by the 
character and those who read it over slow modem 
connections do not appreciate 100 lines of quoted text for
a three line reply. (Those of us reading it over fast 
connections don't appreciate it much, either.)

5. Source of less than 250 lines may be posted to the list 
in plain text, and you are encouraged to do so. This makes 
discussion of the source and questions about it much 
easier to accomplish for other list members. Longer source, 
or that which is contained in several files, should be 
archived into either a lha or lzh archive, then uuencoded 
and sent to the list. For really large postings, over 20K 
or so, post a message on the list notifying the members 
of the file's availability and mail it only to those who 
show interest. Please do not post very large files to the 
list without checking first to be sure that a majority of 
list members want them. As another option, such files can 
be put in the FTP directory dev/e at your favorite AmiNet 
site. These basic ideas apply to binary files, as well.

6. Finally, remember that this list is moderated - by me. 
I don't generally get involved in a heavy-handed way, but 
those who consistently violate the basic rule of "be 
considerate" may receive warnings from me, or even be 
removed from the list. I also reserve the right to reject 
any posting which is clearly not appropriate. Such a 
rejection will always result in a message to the list 
stating the action and the reason for doing so.


Finally:
========

Of course, if this list really isn't what you had hoped it 
would be, you can unsubscribe. We'll miss you, though. If 
your problem is volume or time, you might find the 
archives useful. Some people don't subscribe to the list 
but keep up by reading the monthly archives. These people 
may also post.  If you want to read the archives regularly 
without subscribing, consider sending me your address so 
I can send you a monthly message letting you know when 
the archives have been put up on AmiNet. 

Thanks to all of you for having helped to make the AmigaE
Mailing List as fun and informative as it has been. Happy
New Year to everyone, and I wish you all health, happiness
and peace in 1994.  

Norm.

Big question?? Is this mailing list still alive????
Is anyone out there?

FreeNet..... Thankfully it's free.....
Otherwise I might have killed someone by now.

I would say the list is still alive.  In fact, this is the first message I've
gotten from the list in a VERY long time (perhaps three months).  Must be the
list-server software or something.

Anyway, since I've not been keeping up with anything, has anyone looked at the
code I wrote for 'Quip,' the fortune-cookie program from hell?  I have taken a
sort of hiatus from programming for a while, so I could relax a bit (and
because I was finally taking my first programming course in school... blew it
away because it was so easy, but it took a lot of my time).

Although I still haven't finished with Quip (I want to include xpk crunching
abilities), I would like to start another project for a BBS door (for any BBS
willing to mess with stdio doors).  I haven't seen a really decent TradeWars
clone for the Amiga, except for one particular one that is written in ARexx,
and only works with a specific BBS (plegh).

I'm currently working out the specifications.. and if I program to these specs,
it looks like it could blow just about any other version of this genre away (at
least, as far as I've seen), with the possible exception of Galactic Trader for
VMS.  For example, this program will have three 'religions' built into it, so
if you get caught in a warp lane, or stuck in a dead-end sector with no warps
out, you can pray to your diety for help.  Which also suggests something; you
can get trapped in my game, because the warp points can be moved around (talk
about CHAOS.. brew ha ha ha ha).

I still have a lot of details, but if anybody is interested, lemme know and
I'll send what I've worked out so far.

Subject: Window w/scroll

Happy New Year!  And what better way to start the new year than with
a question!  In my never-ending quest to prove how dumb I am, I am 
once again stumped with a programming problem.

I want to open a window with a scroller bar on the side like a text
editor has.  I thought this was a standard thing with a window, but I
can't find any way to do this.

What I want to do is open a window, output some text into it, and let
the user scroll around in it until they're done and hit the close
gadget.  Seems simple enough, but I can't find any examples to guide
me.

If anyone has a good example that does something like this, I'd love
to take a look at it.  I've searched through some of the Aminet
files, but I can't find anything that does this.  Any ideas?  Help?!

(Just so I don't look quite so dumb, this is my first excursion into
Intuition, so I'm at a loss most of the time.  :-) My RKRM-Libraries
hasn't gotten here yet, so I'm relying on hints, tips, and example
source to get by.  I'm using gadtools.library.)

Later,

     Jim

Subject: Listview gadgets

Can anyone help? I've designed a beautiful GUI (well, I like it!) with
GadToolsBox. I've ran it through SrcGen, and I've got the code. I've
written the IDCMP message handler, I've got the code. All I need now is to
be able to get ListView gadgets working! SrcGen doesn't support tags; how
do I define what I want in the listview gadget? I've tried various things,
but all I seem to be able to do is either create a blank gadget, or worse
still, guru the machine!
     Could some kind soul post a quick example of LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets in
action?

     What is the best command to wait for a keypress from the user? 
I'd like to do it in the same style as LhA does, ie. user would not
have to press return after pressing the desired key. WaitForChar()
came first into my mind, but it requires enter to be pressed after
the actual key. Thanks in advance,

Subject: ADMIN: Mailing list trivia

Well, folks, the changeover to making amigae an listserv
mailing list, while fraught with pitfalls seems to be up
and running.

Several of you may have noticed all sorts of bizarre
things coming from the list, especially problems with
headers and return paths. These have been fixed now and,
finally, appear to be processing list mail with all the
headers in their proper places. (And all it cost me in
the process was one disk crash/reformat/restore!)

There was another problem from a user at a FIDO gatewayed
site that resulted in dozens of "undeliverable mail" 
messages over the last three or four days. For anyone who
was troubled by these, I apologize. The problem was that
the FIDO site deemed the user unknown, and then proceeded
to mail the error message to the address in the "reply-to"
field (instead of the From or Path fields, as it should
have). This, now that the reply-to field points to
amigae@bkhouse.cts.com was broadcasting dozens of error
messages to the list at large. What a mess.

Anyway, if any of you have trouble with the list, please
let me know.

Finally, I have noticed some discussion lately about how
slow the list traffic has been ("is this list alive?") and 
such. The answer is that yes, the list is very much alive,
and yes the list has been painfully slow for nearly two 
months. I trust that by upgrading the list software and
beaming out a list announcement to the USENET newsgroup
comp.sys.amiga.programmer that we can perk things up 
around here a bit. For the months of November and December,
messages requesting subscriptions/unsubscriptions have 
been outnumbering list traffic five to one. 

I hope you all had a good New Year's, and I have great 
hopes for the growth of this list in 1994, both in terms of
membership and usefulness to Amiga E programmers.

Thanks for everyone's patience.

Norm.

Hi All,

  Maybe some of you out there can help a newbie in learning
how to program in E. I've had Amiga E for some time now but,
havn't really done anything with it. I've messed around with
the examples and such but that's about as far as it's gone.
I have also opened a window and output some simple sentences
and the like to it.

  Now for my problem. Maybe I'm looking at this wrong or looking
to deep, but for some reason I can't seem to get how you define
and use variables. I've read through the manuals, and maybe I'm
overlooking the obvious, but I just don't seem to comprehend what's
going on.

  In basic I would just do this:

        a$ = "apples"
        b$ = "There are"
        print b$+"5"+a$

  This would print on the screen;

               "There are 5 apples"


  How would I do something similar in E. I think if I could just
get this one thing down, the rest would fall into place. For some
reason this one simple thing seems to elude me.

thanks in advance

Assuming that you are using V36 (or higher), you can use the SetMode function
(it's a Dos library entry point). The call is: success=SetMode(fh,mode) where
fh is the filehandle of the window you opened, and mode determines if the
console.device operates in raw-mode or normal mode. Use 1 for raw mode and 0
for normal mode. Be advised that in raw-mode, you don't get any input output
to the screen. If you want or need to see on the screen the character that was
pressed, you have to echo it yourself. Also be aware that you will have to use
the read function to get your input and that you will get more than 1
character of input if one of the function keys is pressed (even more if its a
shifted function key). Other, perhaps useful info: Even if you didn't use Open
to get a separate E-provided window there are ways to determined its
filehandle and there is a way to do this same trick (toggle raw-mode, normal
mode) in a pre-V36 enviroment, although it is a LOT harder. Let me
know (usr1400a@tso.uc.edu, Carl Jolley) if you want or need any more info on
this topic.

Subject: TradeWars clone questions/answers

Greg Wilkerson asks me:

| What BBS program with your Trade Wars clone run under?? It sounds EXCELLANT!!
| Any idea  when U will have a public release??

My TradeWars clone will use stdio (stdout, stdin), so one should be able to use
it with any BBS program that can redirect a program's i/o.

That is to say, if the BBS can let a user use a program that would work within
a shell's console, it'll work with this program.  That means the majority of
all the various BBS programs in existence for the Amiga will be able to use
this.  The major limitation I'll wind up imposing will be a need for WB 2.04,
mostly because it'd be a pain to try to program for anything lower (and
somewhat like beating my head against the wall).

Currently, I know Citadel BBS can use stdio, and CNet can (if you get the
latest versions.. I think anything past 2.0 will handle stdio pretty well).  I
think DLG and some of the others will, too, but I'm not as familiar with them. 
Frankly, if I were a sysop, I wouldn't choose a BBS that wouldn't allow me to
use stdio doors on my system... but that's me.  I don't believe in forcing
sysops to use a particular BBS's format to get a program to work.

As for when I'll have a public release... well.. I really don't know.

I don't have the money it would take to dedicate all my time to this project,
and worse yet, I have to continue my education in college <shudder>.  I'm
halfway through my junior year now.  Programming during the semester is
severely slowed for me, since my top priority is getting my degree in music.

However, I'm taking an EXTREMELY structured and organized approach to
programming this project.  To date, I haven't written a single line of code,
but I have perhaps 1000 lines of specifications.  In essence, I'm trying to
write the manual for the program before I actually write the program.

This approach will let me know, clearly, what I'm going to write, what approach
I need to take in writing it, and will help me to avoid making errors along the
way.  That's why I've mentioned it.  I want to know if anyone else is
interested in these preliminary planning stages, before I actually start
coding.

I would upload what I've done of the specifications (which, in time, are going
to be converted to AmigaGuide format, but for now are in a text format), except
the file is already fairly large, and I don't want to bog people down with it. 
I will be happy to mail it to those who express an interest, though.  But, it
should be noted, I still have not finished the specs.  I have a LOT more work
to do (in my opinion).. namely, I have to come up with planet types, various
kinds of goods for sale, various kinds of .. I'm not sure how to describe it ..
"enhancers" for things I call 'Stills' and for ships (eg: force sheilds,
automated sub-space radio alarms, etc).  Currently, the game has a chance for
depth that is fairly staggering.. which is what I'm looking for.  It also
promises to be perhaps the most flexible (read: the most chaotic) version of
this genre to date.

This is another example for lists of strings in E.The special thing about this example
is the use of the function insert().This function inserts a string in a sorted list,
so that it remains sorted.So,starting from NIL,simple calling insert() again and again
will create a sorted list of strings.This is quite handy if you do not want to sort the
list after it has been build.The whole example is in the Public Domain,so use it and change
it at will.Have Fun!

Subject: Re: How to wait..

[Question on how to get single-character input from a console without needing a
return character, followed by:]

| You can do it the dirty way, by making a busy-wait loop...

[Billions of shards of broken glass fly through the air, rending all offendng
busy-wait programs to bits, while the failed programmers who created the foul
monsters weep bitterly.  An ecstatic public of users cry 'Hosanna' in triumph.]

There's no need to busy wait <grin>.  To use WaitForChar(), you need to first
use SetMode() to change the behavior of CON: to RAW:.

That is:

BOOL SetMode(file_handler, LONG mode)

where 'mode' is '1' to go to RAW: mode, '0' to go to CON: mode, and
'file_handler' is simply the filehandle you Open()ed earlier.

This is, of course, assuming you're using WB 2.04.  For previous versions, all
I remember is that you had to do some extremely unpleasant (and funky)
weirdness to the filehandle itself, but I cannot remember specifically what. 
But, who programs for anything less than 2.04 anymore <evil grin>.

Subject: Re: Newbie Question

The basic question (pun intended) was:

  In basic I would just do this:

        a$ = "apples"
        b$ = "There are"
        print b$+"5"+a$

  This would print on the screen;

               "There are 5 apples"


  How would I do something similar in E.

[end quote]

a := 'apples'
b := 'There are'
Printf('\s 5 \s\n',a,b)

Unless I've completely lost my mind, this should do it.  Conceptually, you need
to think of E's Printf statement as being somewhat different from BASIC's
'print' statement, in that the first parameter (the stuff enclosed in the "'"
characters) of the Printf is a form to which the rest of the parameters (,a,b)
conform.

So, in this case, the '\s' things you see in the form tell Printf:

"I want to print a string here."

If you had put '\d' instead, you would be saying:

"I want to print a four-byte number in decimal notation here."

Which, in the above example, might print something like:

203984092 5 43298432987

Which, obviously, isn't what you're looking for.

The '\n' tells Printf to print a new line.  If you look carefully in the
Reference.doc (or, Reference.guide, if you downloaded that... I personally
recommend it, as it's hypertext (read: AmigaGuide) format, but then, I'm biased
as I went to a great deal of trouble to create it <grin>) you'll find all the
various '\' formatting codes, as well as some others.  I would also recommend
reading up on DoRawFormat (I think) in the RKRM, as both E and the Amiga seems
to use this function a lot for printing things, as well as other whatnot.

Another thing to consider, conceptionally, is what E is thinking when you
assign those string variables:

a := 'Let''s talk fish.'

The above example assigns a four-byte value to the variable "a".  This
four-byte value tells E where it can find a string of text that says "Let's
talk fish." (the reason for the two ' characters in "Let''s" is so E knows you
really mean for that one character to be included in the string, rather than
ending the string... otherwise, you'd get "Let", and a bunch of errors).

Hope this helps.

I'm using GadToolsBox, SrcGen and E to create my first E program, but

Also I was wondering if anyone could give me a hint how to access the

As E automatically (automagically? Hih..) deallocates all your resources,
you don't have to worry about the memory-thingy. GREAT thanks for that
to Wouter van Oortmerssen (Or should I call him just Wouter.. We all
are after all reading the E-mailing list..;) ) Previously while coding
in assembly freeing all the memory was always a problem. Anyway, I guess
that's of no interest to anyone. I hope this message helped...

The example source that comes with AmigaE has a program called
GadtoolsDemo.e
It shows you (very basically) how to do it. You create a list of nodes
(exec/nodes  'nl') and supply the pointer of that list to the listview
gadget (GTLV_LABELS,mylist,....)
You can't use a LIST like with cycle or MX gadgets.
Take particular note of AddTail()  :-)
As yet I dont understand why, but you initially create a LIST
which apparently keeps a pointer to the first and last nodes.
AddTail() updates this every time you add a node.
The whole thing is not the simplest of concepts IMHO  :-)

Subject: shared library creation (?)


I've got what may be a toughie to answer.

I have, in my mind, a couple of projects that I might like to do, in order to
make some future programs I want to write (and perhaps other people's programs)
easier to write.

The problem is, I want to create a run-time shared library, that is re-entrant,
yet not have to program the cursed thing with Assembly or C.  I want to write
this in 'E'.

Specifically, I would like to create a curses.library for the Amiga, to handle
the same sort of stuff you see on VAX and unix terminals with text, as I want
to write BBS software in the future (some of you may have read what I wrote
concerning the TradeWars door I want to write).  An Amiga curses library would
get the termcap file, do all the little internal conversion thingies, and
provide all the horrible little functions for screen manipulation that
currently doesn't exist for the Amiga as a run-time shared library (although,
as I understand it, it DOES exist as a linked library somewhere).

Problem is, of course, that I have NO idea how to go about writing a run-time
shared library for the Amiga.  In fact, I have no idea how to write a device,
or a resource, ... just programs.

If this has already been explained somewhere, I'd really be tickled pink if
someone could refer me to the text (especially if the text is available).  If
it hasn't already been explained, could someone clue me in on the secret?  How
does one write a run-time shared library for the Amiga.. and while I'm at it,
how does one write a software device (*.device), and a resource
(l:blah-handler)?  And how can all these things been done with 'E'?

Subject: getchar() without the line feed

  There have been a few questions on the list recently asking about geting
a single character in from the console without waiting on a charage return.
  
  This is how I do it.  The following code will go to sleep for about 100
microseconds waiting on a character, then if no character was found it will
return NIL.  This will only work if the console is in the raw mode.

  The reason I need to read characters in this way is that I am writing games
for a bbs program that gets it's input from the stdout path, and I must
always watch for the user droping the carrier.

  If anyone knows of a better way to do this please let me know.

Subject: E <-> C compatibility?

I suspect I could guess the answer to this, but it can't hurt
asking: Is there any sort of compatibility between E and C.  Can
you write routines in E that'd produce some kind of ".o" file that
a C program could link with.  On the other side of the coin, can
you write an E routine that could link with and call routines from
a standard ".o" file?

Thanks

Try this: WriteF('There are \d \s.\n',number,product)
Have you printed out the Language Referance guide?  This will give you
the diffrent formats of data output useing WriteF.
Anyway back to the WriteF('There are \d \s.\n',number, product).
Output will look like this:  There are 5 apples.
You can use any varible in place of number and product.
Hope this helps...

Assign a pointer of type 'gadget' when you create the gadget.
e.g  DEF mystring=NIL:PTR TO gadget
and use the return value of Creategadget to this pointer

e.g. mystring:=CreateGadgetA(...)

When you want to get the pointer to the string's buffer later...

variable:=mystring.specialinfo
StrCopy(newstring,^variable,ALL)

This will result in 'newstring' containing the string they typed EVEN IF
THEN DIDN'T PRESS RETURN!

I don't know if this is the recommended way of doing it, but it
certainly works  :-)

BTW, to get an INTEGER_KIND's value, do the same but...

newvalue:=Val(^variable,NIL)

I would like to look at you specs.  I'm an active TW2002 player with
quite a bit of experience.  I have played several other TW-style games
as well.  I might be able to provide some help in the areas of
complexity and playability.  I hope to help you gather the best of all
the TW clones and make the "ultimate" version of TW.

I am the author of a TW utility for the Amiga called "TWdb" (TradeWars
Database- written in 'E'.).  It is the only Amiga utility of its type
that I'm aware of. I have gotten lots of praise and thanks from users
around the world.  They are finally able to compete with the MSDOS
crowd.  (MSDOS users have several utilities to choose from.)

I would like to see some sort of data retrieval built into your game.
TW2002 is the only game I know of that has generated more source code
in utilities than the game itself contains.  I find this very
interesting.  Good analysis of the data is a very important part of
the successful player's overall strategy.  Perhaps I could modify my
utility to work with your game.

Let me know what you think about all this.  Best of luck in school.

Later,

        Jim

PS.  If you are going to send me your specs, try this method.  LHA
your text and then UUEncode the lha file.  You can then send the
uuencoded file to me as an email message.  Thanks.

First. A very good tag in Listviews are: GTLV_Labels
Here you define your own List. Yes, you have to play with Lists and
Nodes.

First Allocate a List structure.

(struct List*)MyList=AllocList(sizeof(struct List));

Ok, now we have allocated a List. Lets Inistialize it.

NewList(MyList);

Now we have out List. Which is the head. The GTLV_labels whats the address
to this list.

Want something in it? Simple. First:

(struct Node*)MyNode=AllocNode(sizeof(struct Node));

And put the name of the viewable text in: MyNode->ln_PubName

And: AddTail(MyList, MyNode);

Tada, and finnished. You only have to allocate the List once, and 
then one Node for each item.

 KA>      Could some kind soul post a quick example of LISTVIEW_KIND gadgets

Hope this helps. I don't have E on the Harddrive anymore, mostly because
I don't have E on my school. :) 

The thing I'm looking for is to be able to make linkable object files.
Then I can do some timeconsuming routines in E, instead of Assembler which
I don't understand. :)

Anyway, good luck with the ListView. Anymore questions?

ps, one way that works is to do something like:

   continuehere: ENDFOR breakhere:

and then have "continue" --> JUMP continuehere and "break" -->
JUMP breakhere, but since labels are global, you have to be a bit

Hi, this is from Jason Maskell,
	I've got a few questions for an E programmer stuck in the boonies..
	1. When should the newest Amiga E (v2.5?) be released. Wouter?
	2. Will the newest E allow:
		- Compiling libraries/devices?
		-infinite ptr dereferencing a.b.c.d.e.f etc? Please no limits.
		-What happened to the person uploading archived Amiga E
		mailing list stuff? I have ftp access and no email at this
		time so this was the only way I was getting to read it.
	3. What're people here working on?

	I myself am working on a directory utility, (like Dopus/Dirwork) 
but designed to beat them both. Mike Wesson here is working on learning E 
by writing a bbs door. Rather hard when you don't have the RKMs or even 
autodocs.

Subject: mk3d.. stereogram text


For those of you interested in stereogram text weirdness, I just finished
converting mk3d over to Amiga E (it was originally written in C).

I picked up the source code from alt.ascii-art (or somesuch) and wanted to make
an E version of it so we could enjoy it (the C version makes a large
executable).

As a result, I now have a better product.  I added some extra nifties to the
program, and gave it a (hopefully) better manual to follow.

The source code is under 300 lines, but I'll upload the thing to Aminet (if I
can get to it) so you can check it out... the source code will be included with
the executable.  I don't claim to be a wonderful programmer, but maybe you'll
see some things you can use.

In any event.. Happy New Year.  I didn't expect to write anything else so soon.

Although I have read tutorials about how to write shared run-time libraries
for the Amiga, I can't remember the source of the document and I have
never written one myself. The reason I am replying relates to the last
sentence of the above quote. It is my understanding, and belief that
the only way to write a shared library for the Amiga in E would be to use the
OPT ASM option for the entire source program. This would mean, in effect,
that the program was written in assembly language and I don't believe that
is what you had in mind. The one thing that the ASM option does is that it
inhibits E from producing its standard program startup code. The startup
code required for a shared library is incompatable with the E-generated
standard code. So, AFAIK, its not possible to write a shared library in
E although with a lot of code and trouble,it might be possible to write
an E program that when launched as a normal program could then "provide"
a shared library interface where _most_ of the code was written in E for
the various library entry points.

Although, I have even less knowledge about devices, resources and handlers,
my WAG is that the same type of limitation would apply to those types
of executable code as it probably would to a .font type file.

Right now I'm relearning what I forgot in C about intuition programming and
applying it with E. It quickly becomes apparent I need the RKMs for 2.0. All
I have is the 1.3 Libraries and Devices, and it isn't too helpful right now.
Eventually I want to start producing some network applications (for DLG Pro,
also maybe try writing an offline reader).

Yeah. :-) Fortunately the RKMs aren't that expensive. I'm just not sure which
one is "essential". Makes me wish there were more Amiga programmers in town
so I could borrow their copies. :)

Subject: SetFunction and calling E code


Some time ago I was trying to get SetFunction() to work from E.  I tried all
kinds of things (and not very many of them were sensible).  Recently I asked
Wouter if he could give me an example of how to use CreateNewProc() from E
and he came up with a lovely little example (albeit using AddTask()).  Then
everything fell into place and I realised what I'd been doing wrong.  The
following example program shows, I think, how you should do it.

So, to the vital clue:  to use an E procedure from another task you need
some way of setting register A4 to the correct value.  The simplest way is
to use self-modifying code (yuk!), as in the example below where "store" is
used.  The procedure (or labelled code) which is run from a different task
must reinstate A4 to the stored value before it can use any E variables.  Of
course, you can save things on the stack before changing A4 if you need to.

Now the example: this behaves a bit like SnoopDos, monitoring calls to
OpenLibrary() (in exec.library).  It uses the SetFunction() call to run
a piece of E code instead of the normal OpenLibrary() code.  There are
several points worth mentioning:

1) Self-modifying code in two places: "store" and "patch".  This means this
   program might not work properly on machines with large instruction caches
   (it works OK on my A1200, though).  I'd like to know if someone can get
   rid of the "patch" kludge --- the "store" stuff is respectable in
   comparison.  BTW, the "JMP (A0)" kind of thing didn't work...
2) Use of a message port to enable some visible output.  Because I'm lazy I
   used the Release 2 (and above) CreateMsgPort()/DeleteMsgPort() calls.
   (Will E v3.0 have an amiga.m module like C's amiga.lib?)
   This is a *very* important point: because our patched routine might not
   be run by a process we cannot use any dos.library calls.  However, we
   can send a message to the process that did the patch and tell it what to
   print!
3) Moving on to the patched routine (labelled "newf"), the first thing that
   is done is preserving all the registers.  We don't want to muck up the
   arguments that were sent to the OpenLibrary() call.
4) Luckily, the call to sendmsg() from the patched routine seems to
   preserve A1, which is what we are interested in. (Wouter, what registers
   can we rely on being preserved?)
5) sendmsg() works out the name of the task that is running it and sends
   this name and the name of the library in a message.
6) Back in main(), the patching process is waiting for a CTRL-C from the
   user or a message on its (private) port.  Any messages received are
   processed and printed nicely (!).
7) The first Disable() call is necessary. The second is probably not (call
   me paranoid if you will).  I think the PutMsg() does not need wrapping
   in Disable()/Enable() (or Forbid()/Permit()) because we know the port
   isn't going away...
8) The New() call from the patched routine seems to work.  And the memory
   seems to be added to the patching routine's memory list and freed when
   it terminates.  All the same I threw in some Dispose[Link]()'s (in
   printmsgs()) to allow some re-use of memory whilst it's running).
9) Using SetFunction() can never be 100% reliable so don't do it ;-)
   What this means is: don't expect something like this to work if you have
   another program messing with the library...

Well, I hope this is correct and (or?) helpful...

->         1. When should the newest Amiga E (v2.5?) be released. Wouter?
 
Like I explained earlier on the list, there won't be a v2.5, but instead a
_much_ larger update called v3. Don't blame me for not being on schedule,
I really don't know when it'll be done. It's way more work than I ever 
imagined.
 
I feel I'm quite close now, but one can never tell. there's still so
much OO bits and pieces to do etc. I'll probably give a more extensive
report when I'm pretty much done.

I'm planning an OPT LIBRARY, but I don't think it'll be in v3. As for
all things, if it's not in v3, it probably gets there in an update.
 
->                 -infinite ptr dereferencing a.b.c.d.e.f etc? Please no limits.
 
something like that, yes, though not in that syntax, probably.

Hi, all

I see that this year, the maling list is more active, Great !

Have 2 question (that I already sent before but without answer)

1) I have a string and long variables. How can I concatenate them ? Follows an
   example :
     DEF st[256] : STRING,
         var : LONG

     /* ... */
  
     StrCopy(st,'hi all',ALL)
     var:=12

I want to have st = 'hi all12'

2) How can I have the complete list from the ReqTools file requester.
   It is in the rtfilelist structures, but I only have the first item...

Note : I'm under 1.3.
       Please send my some example :)

Thanx in advance

You asked:

Yes, there IS a way.  In my own code, I used:

StringF(num,'\d',j-1)

Where 'num' becomes the buffer into which a string form of 'j-1' (a LONG value,
formatted by '\d') is placed.  Hope that helps.

        \    \
         \    \____ the above buffer
          \____ the string you want to concat. the number to.

Naturally, you'll have to make sure both buffers are large enough to hold all
the information.

I regret, your second question I cannot work on right now.

Subject: Who I am ... and something new for MUI

	Hi everybody (and happy new year !),

	As I am new on this mailing list, I introduce myself.
	First of all, I am French and my English is very very bad as you can
see. So I apologize for this message and the ones which will come.
	Second, I am a student of a french ingeneering school (the ENSEEIHT) and
I am in the computer section of this school. Now, it's my third (and last)
year in this school. My favourite domain is computer architecture and assembling
language.
	Of course my personal computer is an Amiga (you know, the only one who
makes it possible...). My exact configuration is :
	- A2000B
	- a GVP 68030/68882 (40Mhz) board
	- 8 Mo FAST RAM
	- HD 100 Mo
	- kickfile 3.0
	My favourite interest with it is public domain, sometimes games and of
course system programmation. As it is difficult to program all in assembling
language, I choose the best (for my point of view) compilator for the Amiga,
namely Amiga E. I LOVE its speed and it is so easy to use.. but you know all
that.
	It's a long time I know this mailing list, but I never try to subscribe
it cause of my too bad English. But now I think I have good reasons to do it.
Indeed, I make a E preprocessor which only supports macros replacing. Why did
I make it ? Because I wanted to use MUI with Amiga E, and to program MUI without
macros is quite impossible. So with this preprocessor (called Mac2E), I made
all that is needed to use MUI 1.4 with. The good news is that a wonderful
MUI builder (written by a friend) will be available soon (see below). So
I convince my friend to make the generated code of his MUI-Builder to be
generic, in order to be able to generate any kind of code. And I success !
So MUI-Builder (for the moment) is able to generate C and ... E code. The very
good news is that I put Mac2E on aminet wednesday morning (in France), and my
friend will put his MUI-Builder (with my E code generation module) wednesday
morning too. Of course, if some of you want more precise information on them,
I can answer (e-mail me at vintenat@irit.fr). If there is a lot of identical
questions, I will make a global report to this list. I can also e-mail the 2
archives for those of you who haven't ftp access or who can't wait.

	That's all, I hope all these news will interest you...

	See you soon, Lionel

PS: Someone told me about a next 3.0 version of Amiga E which will be soon
available. Can someone confirm me this news (with perhaps a date...) ?

[rest deleted]

I had previously gotten SetFunction to work but I ran across the CreateProc
function on a different project. I wanted to try to "clone" Olaf Barthel's
little utility that opens a little window in the window title bar and
maintains a display of the current head number of each diskette on the
system and changes each time any diskette head changes position. This
program was called TrackDisplay by Mr. Barthel. I called mine E_TrackDisplay.
I had access to Olaf's C source code so I had a good head start on how to
write the program. Some of the items that I included in my code were:
cli/shell self-detaching, setting up an interrupt and tying it to the
verticle blank interrupt. In doing the cli self-detach, I effectively fired
up a copy of the E program via CreateProc (I'm running 1.3) and the trick
about copying the value of A4 was, of course, crutial to getting the
"cloned" program to run properly. If I recall properly, I saved a copy of
A4 so that the interrupt code could address E global variables. I passed
the value of A4 to the interrupt via the is.data field. In debugging the
program I had a situation where I was failing to free 24 bytes of memory
I used the SetFunction to trace AllocMem/FreeMem calls. That was a trip.
BTW, A4 provides the means to address global variables in an E program,
but if you are calling code and need to be able to address local variables,
you have to save and restore A5. As it turns out A5 will have a different
value if calling from the main procedure vs. calling from a PROC.

Subject: Address of field within OBJECT?


Hi!  I'm new to this mailing list so I don't know if this has been covered
before or not.  I'm trying to get the address of a specific field
within an object.  Is this possible?  Here's an example...

'exec/lists.m' has an object thus:

   OBJECT lh
     head     : LONG
     tail     : LONG
     tailpred : LONG
     <etc..>
   ENDOBJECT

In my source code:

DEF   broker_list : PTR TO lh;
      broker_list := New(SIZEOF lh);
   
Now, what I need to do is set 'broker_list.head' to the address of
'broker_list.tail'.  (This is part of the setup of a list header
for using exec linked list functions.  amiga.lib has routine NewList()
to do this but, alas, we don't have it in E... yet)

I tried this: 

   broker_list.head := {broker_list.tail};

But E did not like it.  What I ended up doing was this:

   broker_list.head := broker_list + 4;

This is really poor style and I was hoping for a better way to it.
Any suggestions?  Thanks...

-Rob

Subject: How do I fill this object?

Hi all!

My question is: How do I fill out an OBJECT that consists of a substructure?
For example, I have problems with filling this OBJECT:

OBJECT is          /* interrupt structure (exec/interrupts) */
  ln:substructure  /* this is a listnode structure (exec/nodes) */
  data:LONG       
  code:LONG
ENDOBJECT

I tried:
1) DEF x:PTR TO is and then is:=[succ,pred,name,type,pri,data,code]:is
                       'ln' data ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^,^^^^^^^^^ 'is' data

2) DEF x:PTR TO is and then is:=[[succ,pred,name,type,pri]:ln,data,code]:is
   because I thought maybe the ln substructure is a pointer instead of the
   actual data.
Questions:
1) How do I fill out this babe using these immediate lists?
2) should the 'ln' entry in 'is' be a pointer to a node, or the data of the
   node? 
Note:
1) I did not know the exact ln format here, so maybe I missed one entry...

Wouter Oostmerssen himself, the author of Amiga E, is indeed very busy
creating 3.0. Because he wanted to implement far more features (many OO
things and modular design) it's going to take a while before it is finished.

Wouter told me that the compiler is now in it's final state, meaning that he
implements the last features, writes the docs and has it tested.

I'm also looking forward for this cOOl 3.0 compiler.

	'ln' entry is the data of the node. If it was a pointer to a node, the
'is' definition would be
OBJECT is
  ln:LONG	/* or ln:PTR TO listnode (I'm not sure...) */
  data:LONG
  code:LONG
ENDOBJECT

>1) How do I fill out this babe using these immediate lists?

	As immediate lists always return pointer and as 'ln' is a substructure
(not a pointer, see above), I think you must fill each entry in the structure
'by hand' :
DEF x:PTR TO is, y:PTR TO listnode
x:=New(SIZEOF is)
y:={x}			/* x and x.ln get are at the same address */
y.succ:=succ
...
x.data:=data

E object are like variable. Don't search difficulties.

Please don't apologize for bad English!!!!  Were we all to try to send you
mail in French, you would have a _very_ good laugh.  It's unfortunate that
French is the language of choice on the net, but it's probably easier to
use English than it is to use German/Italian/French/Esperanto (though I
would prefer Esperanto: even though I'm not very good at it) since English
is so widely taught.

Yeah! A MUI builder.  That will be great for the next release of MUI
(which internalizes all the classes).

We don't know.  You don't know.  Wouter doesn't know.  It's more fun that way.

C'est fantastique qu'il y ait finalement quelque chose qui facilite l'usage de
la MUI avec E! Seulement un petit probleme: vous n'avez pas indique ou on
pourrait telecharger les modules que vous avez ecrits. Wouter m'a suggere qu'il
allait y avoir quelque chose parce que je lui avais pose la question de savoir
comment on peut utiliser MUI a l'interieur d'un programme en E. De toute facon
je serais tres interesse...Vous nous rendriez tous un service enorme si vous
mettiez vos travaux a la disposition de tout le monde a travers AMINET. Je vous
remercie de votre travail et bonne continuation! Oh, une autre chose: vous
ecrivez bien l'anglais, ne vous en faites pas. Merci de nouveau

Well, if broker_list + 4 works but you want more "style" you might consider:
 
    Broker_list.head := broker_list + SIZEOF LONG;

} Yes, there IS a way.  In my own code, I used:

AHA!!!  I couldn't find 'StringF' in my reference doc.  Knowing
that it is actually there, I was able to find only:

Strings may contain format signs introduced by a slash "\", either
to introduce characters to the string that are for some reason
not displayable, or for use with string formatting functions
like WriteF(), TextF() and StringF(), or kick2 Vprintf().

But nowhere in the doc does it actually *describe* StringF.  THANKS!!!

As a side note, are there other 'hidden' functions I/we might want
to know about?

Parlez Anglais, s'il vous plait.

Can we keep all postings in english, so all on this list can understand any

Subject: SORRY !

----------------------------------------------------------------

This is not for Lionel !

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry. I've send a mail to my friend Lionel, who is a subscriber too.
I made a reply to his mail, but the email address was wrong (it was the
AmigaE email...) Hope you'll understand :)


Note: When I send a mail to the ML, it comes back after ONE day. I heard that
the ML was slow, but sooooooooo slow. I wouldn't believe it, but...
Is it then normal ???????

Bye

DEF buf[32]:STRING,mynumber=49756

StringF(buf,'\d',mynumber)

WriteF('\s\n',buf)

resulting in '49756'

You can do the same to produce hex-strings of decimal numbers too.

StringF(buf,'$\h',mynumber)

This source gives us a window with an empty gadget - no image!
We've also tried AddGadget(), but can't get the gadget on the screen 
at all. Most of the times a pattern appeared, the screen got black, 
and the Amiga crashed without any warnings (sometimes we got guru 
number 81000005 or 8100000B).

Can anybody help us with this problem?


In Karl-Erik's experiments with INCBIN, he also discovered how to 
include an IFF file into a program and show it with iff.library:

   It is not neccesary to use IfFL_OpenIff().

   Change the name of the bitmap (at the end of the source) to your own
   picture path and name.

You're not allowed to modify a GadTools gadget using your own image
rendering, and I would guess that the button gadget does not recognise the
GA_IMAGE tag. Your best bet would be to use a GENERIC_KIND gadget with
your own rendering. The Libraries RKM describes how to do this.

Cheers
Dave Higginson

And yes, I did post the iff source :-)

P.S. It's nice to be back. I see that Norm's changed to a listserv 
system. I had major problems subscribing last year between September and 
November because I could not get any mail through to Norm.

Subject: Many Questions....

Hi all

I've sevral questions :

1 : How is it possible to create an Object with an String item in it.

     OBJECT x
        t[20] : STRING,
        l : LONG
     ENDOBJECT

    this example doesn't work....

2 : I'using the ReqTools.library. I call the RtGetLonGA function, but de 
    returned buffer is clear....

    Example :
       buf:=0
       ok:=RtGetLongA(buf,'get long',NIL,0)
       WriteF('buf = \d',buf)

    running :
       buf = 0  (whatever I enter and press OK !)

    BUT when I recall this line, the content I entered before is always here !?

3 : I compiled the example WbArgs.e found in AmigaE archive. Under WB it 
     doesn't work. This program read the WB arguments you pass to this program.
     Under WB 1.3, I had a Tool icon to WbArg. I run it. The 'Output' window
     opens and closes without doing anything else. No message is written.
     Could someone explain how do I do to run a program under WB 1.3 ?

	Try this :
OBJECT x
	t:LONG
	l:LONG
ENDOBJECT
t:=String(20)

	It's not exactly an object with a string item in it, but it will do the
same.

	I don't know the RtGetLongA() function of the ReqTools library, but
I think that ok:=RtGetLongA({buf},'get long',NIL,0) should work because to
allow a function to modify a LONG variable, you must give to this function the
address of the variable. In the example you give, RtGetLongA writes buf at 0
address.

Subject: Re: Image on a (gadtools) gadget.

> Does anybody know how to put an image on a (gadtools) gadget? We've
> tried something like this:

Hmm your example isn't a gadtools gadget, but I have successfully put an
image on a gadtools 'GENERIC_KIND' gadget in two or three of my programs.
In fact one program has about 10 gadgets with different images.
One thing to try is using DrawImage() and see if that displays the image
correctly in the window. If so, it's a gadget problem; if not then it's
an image problem. For the GENERIC_KIND gadget, you have to make sure
that you have the gadgetrender pointing to the image, selectrender to the
alternate image if you're using one, set the gadget flags to include
GFLG_GADGIMAGE and if you have an alternate image the also GFLG_GADGHIMAGE.

For my image, I used CITAS, which generates c source from a brush,
modified it to suit 'E' and included it in my program.
Rather than add some code here, I'll be making available a demo
GUI program to aid Amiga-E people in creating GUIs using gadtoolsbox
and SRCGEN. It's almost finished now, so I'll post it here ASAP

> 	IF (memblock:=AllocMem(128,MEMF_CHIP))=NIL THEN Raise(ER_MEMORY)

I'm not sure on this but should memblock be DEFined as a PTR TO INT ?

> 	picture.imagedata:=memblock

All my images have a planpick of 3. Maybe try that first?

Oh so that's how you do it?  :-) If that works then I can save quite a bit
of code !

You don't use OpenWindowTagList() ?

Hope I've helped somewhere.

Right.  You're only allowed to have basic types in object 
declarations (LONG, INT, CHAR).  So this is ok:

OBJECT x1
  a:CHAR
  b:INT
  c:LONG, d:CHAR
ENDOBJECT                                  

But trying to reserve storage for larger areas of contiguous
memory is only possible if you know assembly and have
figured out how to use the ICONVERT tool to create your own
modules of OBJECT types.

What you must do here is:

DEF my_x:x1, s:PTR TO CHAR
x1.c:=String(20) /* x1.c is type LONG, used as a PTR TO CHAR */
s:=x1.c          /* x1.c and s now point to the same string  */
/*-- now do something, anything --*/
FOR i := 1 TO StrMax(s) DO s[i]:="0"

You need to pass the *address* of buf so that the library 
function can change it.  Use: 

  ok:=RtGetLongA({buf},'get long',NIL,0)

>>        WriteF('buf = \d',buf)

No other changes, the only different is in the call to 
RtGetLongA().

That's because buf is unchanged (pointing at address 0).
The memory at address 0 this holds your input.  You could 
crash your machine doing that. :-)

Aaaaa! 1.3! :-)  Can't remember if I got that one to work under
1.3, but I think it should.  Put some WriteF() statements in
there and add a Delay(5*50) (to delay 5 seconds) right before
exiting the program.  Dig in, dude!  It's not like you have to
wait for some C compiler to chug, link, and puke! :-) :-)  
(Hang on whilst I fiddle with wbarg.e)  Hm, I could only get
one arg out of wbmessage.  Want to comment, anyone?  Wouter?
wb.numargs is always 1, go figger!

If I come up with anything else I'll holler.

Later.

Subject: "-e" compiler switch?

I was going to put together a set of arexx macros to run the e

And discovered that it selects the compiler switches "-we".  The -w
part is no problem, but my copy of reference.doc makes no mention of
an "e" switch.  What is it?  And.. are there any other switches
that are undocumented?

I had trouble finding it, too, but it's actually in the Reference.[doc|guide]
somewhere.  It wasn't explicitely pointed out in the documentation, so you find
it 'in passing.'  I suppose Wouter forgot about it or something when he was
drawing up the descriptions of things.

Here's the only reference (somewhere around line 214 of 'reference.doc'):

I think, from there, I guessed at what 'StringF' would look like, and it seemed
to work.  Howz THAT for non-stick?

Quite welcome.  Little things like this, though, make me wonder what else I may

Subject: Need help with midi/serial port.

Barry:

I read your August 31, 1993 post to the amigae group in the AUG E archive
on wuarchive.wustl.edu's aminet.   I have not been able to get the 
SEP-OCT archives, so I apologize if this has already been discussed.

I am writing a midi librarian/editor in E.  I am currently executing
AREXX scripts from my E program that execute external programs that send and 
receive midi messages via the serial port.  These programs came with and
use Bill Barton's midi.library v2.0.  This works but is overly cumbersome.
I am doing it this way because I have no idea of how to access the serial 
port directly from E.   I have written similar programs in C, but I now wish
to use E because of E's compilation speed and ease with which you can code
the Amiga specific stuff (and I don't have the 2.0 includes for C).

Ideally I would like to have E modules for the midi.library.  I tried
to use iconvert on the midi.library .i files but it chokes--it creates objects
that have no size.  I don't know enough about E or E modules to figure out 
how to make the modules.

Since I could not build the midi.library E modules, I thought I might try 
sending midi messages using code based on your sert.e example that you posted 
for Vinnie.

In sert.e you included the "serlib" and "libraries/serlib" modules.
These modules were not contained with the Amiga E that I downloaded from
wuarchive.  Is there some site that I could FTP these modules?

Also...are there any ftp sites or other sources of information on E
and E library modules (I already know about aminet sites)?  
Perhaps someone has already created modules for the midi.library?

I appreciate your taking the time to read this message and hope you
can help me.

Thanks,
 -Bob

If you ALWAYS do things the EASY way, you'll keep the code from being obtuse,
making efficient programs and helping users to keep their systems efficient.

We can't have THAT sort of attitude running around now, can we?

Subject: Request for info about two bits of AmigaDOS

Hi--

I don't have a copy of the RKM [yet] and I'm a bit befuddled about
two things that ought to be real simple:
  1) ReadArgs().  Could someone send me the specs on what its
     args are, how it works, what it returns, etc.  The example
     in Utilities doesn't include quite enough explanatory
     text to make clear [for me, at least] just what is happening.
  2) Running an outboard process.  At the simplest level, I'd like
     something like the "system()" call on unix: just a basic way
     to run an external command.  I'm hoping it isn't going to
     involve the mess surrounding "CreateProc" and such [since I
     barely understand any of that, and in any event it seems
     horribly complicated for something I"d hope was simple].

Thanks
  /Bernie\

Subject: CALCULATING CRC


Hello All!

Could anyone send me any AmigaE source showing how I can calculate the
CRC16 of any string. e.g. if I wanted to calculate the CRC of the string
'IAMSTUCK!' how would I do it?

I'm stuck at the moment, and any help esp. Amiga E source code would be
very, very, very, gratefully received!

Please help!

I am not currently attached to this list, so I won't receive any mail
posted to me in here. I've sent my request but so far no reply. So if you
can help please mail my email address: daniel.smith@portofc.org

P.S. Thanks Wouter for such a brilliant language!

Cheers,

Parts of it need recoding, I know. But it does show how to get a file requestor
up and running with E and reqtools. There's probably a more 'correct' way to
get the directory name, but I couldn't figure it out so I used my code
instead.

I've been using SrcGen and GadToolsBox to create the intuition interface
for this program I'm writing. Works fine, except when I open it up on
a public screen of my own the gadgets look 'flat' and washed out. Kinda
like old 1.3 gadgets. :-) How do I get everything to look as nicely 3D as
it does when the window opens on the Workbench screen?

That should be  --> ok:=RtGetLongA({buf},.......

I had the same thing. I haven't tried it since, but something occured to
me some time back... it's trying to get the WB 'args' not tooltypes.
Have you tried selecting the icon, then while holding the LMB down, double
clicking another icon?  I suspect this will work.. Have yet to try it

Hi Olivier,
All I have is a answer to your first question.You wrote:

One solution is : Do not mention the types at all.Like this:

OJBECT x
 t,l
ENDOBJECT

l becomes a long automatically.t can be used as string var,if you dynamically
allocate the memory for it with the String()-Function,like this: 

x.t := String(EStrLen(myvar))

Where myvar is a var,that contains the string to allocate memory for.
Not assigning a type to the vars is not very nice,I admit,but it works
perfectly in my own program.

Greetings,
Juergen

Subject: Double mailings

Sorry about the doubling up of the list mail, folks. My feed
system is sending out each of the list posts (which travel
by way of SMTP) twice. We are working on it.

Also, some of you have asked about the appearance of an
Amigae-Error in the address headers. If your mail reader
gives this as the From address, then it isn't doing things
right. The Amigae-Error address is in the Path and From
pathing header lines which sit at the very beginning of
the headers for a mail message. The From: field is 
explicitly set as amigae@bkhouse.cts.com. This, or a
longer-winded reference to "The AmigaE Mailing List" should
be what you see in your mail software as the from address.
The AmigaE-Error address in the path simply allows mail 
that cannot be delivered (for one reason or another) to be
sent back to that address, where I can keep it seperate
from the admin mail.

So far the LISTSERV seems to be working out pretty well. 
I'm using Peti's Listserv binary, but I wrote all of my 
own stuff to handle list mailing, header reformatting, 
and such. Fairly soon, I'll be replacing Peti's Listserv
with one in AmigaE that handles a few more of the standard
listserv commands (like file gets and digest options). 
Stay tuned. If any of you have had problems with commands
that you have sent to the bkhouse listserv, I'd appreciate
hearing about them.

Norm.

The problem is with your screen. There is some way to set a "NewLook" flag
for the screen... I think you just have to set the drawing pens.

You need to use the SA_PENS tag in your call to OpenScreenTagList(). It 
takes a pointer to an array of colour indices - I think you'll find it in 
the Libraries RKM Screens chapter (the first one I think :-). (Haven't 
got mine with me at the moment).

Anyway, the upshot is that Intuition assumes your application knows about 
the 3D look and so it gives you a 3D screen.

Subject: Some Questions

Hi All,

  Thanks for the help I received on my variables question.

  Now I have some more questions.

    1) I'm using 2.04 dos and don't have the 2.0 RKRM's. I do have
       the 1.3 RKRM's. Would it do me any go to use the 1.3 RKRM's.
       I guess what I'm trying to say is could I at least use the 1.3's
       for the basic stuff.

    2) Could someone tell what Autodocs is. I know that it's either
       a program to extract the commands from the different libraries
       and shows them, or it's kind of an electronic version of the
       RKRM's. 

       My question is, is this a commercial product or share/freeware
       and where can I find or get it.

    3) Could someone show me a simple example of how to get input from
       a window once you open it. I know towrite to the screen you use
       TextF() instead of WriteF(). I can use ReadStr() to get input
       from, say, cli screens, but I can't find what to use from a 
       window that I have opened. I'm writng a little adventure game
       and want to input commands from the window I open.

  Thanks in advance for any help.

Subject: More GUI problems

The solution to this is probably pretty simple, but it's eluding me ...
Part of my program involves taking in several different inputs. I want to
display all the inputs in a gadtools LISTVIEW, with 3 buttons: Add, Delete
and Edit, so that the user can change previous inputs. Everything is
working apart from the LISTVIEW. I can display all inputs, but I cannot get
the gadget to refresh! This means no matter if the user has added, deleted
or edited and entry, it doesn't show. I've tried gadtools.libary
Gt_BeginRefresh & Gt_EndRefresh, and various intuition functinos, but to no
avail.
All I'm doing is modifying list entries, so how do I refresh the gagdet
accordingly? Help, please!

Subject: ListServer suggestion

I apologize for posting this information here, however, I've forgotten the
other three addresses I could mail with suggestions for the servers.

In fact, wessong@ca.usask.herald also seems not to know where to send mail to
unsubscribe himself from the list, and neither does QKBC21@jqy01.ulst.ac.uk.

Which brings me to my point:

   Since there are people on the list who are extremely short-term memories,
would it not be possible to, perhaps each week, send an automated message
detailing those other addresses that, er, address the list server?  This way, I
could avoid the double postings for people asking to be taken out of the
listserver (hopefully), and they could actually get themselves off the list.

   Note: I'm not asking for myself to be taken off the list.  I happen to like
AmigaE VERY much, and the traffic isn't too high for me to handle yet
(although, as soon as the problem with the double messages goes away, things
will indeed be much better).

So... is that cool?  Does everyone else on the list think that's a good idea? 
Is it possible (or easy) to implement?

- Trey

Subject: Many Questions II

Hi all,

First of all, I want to thanx all the poeple who answers my question (about 
5 replies !!!)

1) Does anyone use the IntuiSup.library (it is also called ISUP) ? I try to 
program with it...

2) I saw a C example using the IntuiSup.library. But I'm desesperated when I 
look at it ! My biggest problem is how to do the same as the part of the C 
example below :


              STATIC struct BorderData  test_border_data[] = {
               {
                 4, 273, 33, 87, 25
               }, {
                 2, 275, 106, 95, 21
               }, {
                 1, 397, 112, 97, 15
               }, {
                 3, 374, 6, 63, 14
               }, {
                 INTUISUP_DATA_END
               }
              };

  The question is : is it possible to create this kind of list of strucure.
  Well, I don't know how to explain, I never programmed under C...


Thanx for all answer there will be given !

You're not allowed to modify the list attached to the listview while it's 
displayed on screen. You could be halfway through changing it and 
Intuition would need to read it for display purposes. Then it might read 
a bad pointer and crash.

So you need to use Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA() with the tag GTLV_LABELS and a 
value of $FFFFFFFF. This will tell Intuition that you're messing with the 
list. Then call Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA() again with the tag GTLV_LABLES and a 
pointer to the list. This should solve your problem.

Try this:

  Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA(..................[GTLV_LABELS,yourlabel,.........])

Yep, that easy.. just tell the gadget to look at your list for the labels
again.

My 2.0 RKM libs falls open to gadtools LISTVIEW  :-)

What I'd like to know is a system-friendly way of creating a LIST.

I know I can simply

  DEF listv:PTR TO LONG
  listv:=[0,0,0,0]
  listv[0]:=listv+4
  listv[2]:=listv

But that appears to me to be a very Mickey Mouse way of doing it. Surely
there is a function? Can't find one in exec.lib   (This is exec LISTs Im
chatting about, not  'E' lists.)

Yes.. you just miss out on a lot of GOOD STUFF  :-)  Also there are a number

I believe the 'autodocs' are generated from the sourcecode of the AmigaDOS
authors. The docs come in a book, as text files and as AmigaGuide files.
They basically describe how to use libraries.
Having the autodocs as AmigaGuide is brilliant IMHO. I use them all the
time. They are quite relevant for Amiga E although all the example snippits
are in C

You can get them from whereever developers get their stuff, if you are a
developer. You can write to commodore and buy the Native developer kit, and
don't need to be a registered developer  (that's how I got mine).
You can get them with packages such as SASC.  You can buy the includes and
autodocs BOOKS as they are part of the RKMs

The only way I'm competent with that sort of this is string gadgets. I
believe (with KS 2??) that you can open an intuition window and attach
the console.device to it and therefore use WriteF(), ReadStr() and any
other console functions with it.  I have no idea how to attach
console.device to a window.

The next option is to simulate it yourself using a window with IDCMP_RAWKEY,
displaying what is typed with TextF() or PrintIText() but you're doing
something that is already built into the amiga really.

~8> Hi all,

Hello again, Olivier.

~8> 1) Does anyone use the IntuiSup.library (it is also called ISUP) ? I try to

Nope.

~8> look at it ! My biggest problem is how to do the same as the part of the C

~8> 
~8> 
~8>               STATIC struct BorderData  test_border_data[] = {

~8>                  2, 275, 106, 95, 21
~8>                }, {
~8>                  1, 397, 112, 97, 15
~8>                }, {

~8>                }
~8>               };
~8> 
~8>   The question is : is it possible to create this kind of list of strucure.
~8>   Well, I don't know how to explain, I never programmed under C...

Try:

  DEF test_border_data:PTR TO LONG
  test_border_data:=[[ 4, 273,  33, 87, 25]:borderdata,
                     [ 2, 275, 106, 95, 21]:borderdata,
                     [ 1, 397, 112, 97, 15]:borderdata,
                     [ 3, 374,   6, 63, 14]:borderdata]

Just a wild guess.  I this doesn't work, you should post the
ShowModule output for the borderdata OBJECT and ask again.  I
could give a better answer if I knew what it looked like.

I think I can answer the "STATIC struct BorderData  test_border_data[]"
question.

Try DEFining a variable (perhaps test_border_data), then:

test_border_data:=[[4, 273, 33, 87, 25],[2, 275, 106, 95, 21],
                   [1, 397, 112, 97, 15],[3, 374, 6, 63, 14],
                   [INTUISUP_DATA_END]]

You wind up with lists within lists (cool, huh?).

Hope that helps.

It sounds like a good idea to me. The only question is whether it's easy for
the listserv manager to implement. People should learn to RTFM if they have

I was just wondering if the following would be equivalent to your example.
 
  DEF listv:PTR TO LONG
  listv:=[listv+4,0,listv,0]
 
It might well depend on exactly how Wouter generates E code. Clearly, your
example would work because the "value" of listv would be stored before
any of the list elements which reference its "value". BTW, I'm quoting
"value" to make sure that it remains clear that the "value" in listv is
actually a memory address.

OK, I've tried this in my code....

      SELECT gadgetid
      CASE ADDLIST
        AddTail(lvlist,[0,0,0,0,'!x!']:ln)
        Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA(clicked,win,NIL,[GTLV_LABELS,$FFFFFFFF])
        Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA(clicked,win,NIL,[GTLV_LABELS,lvlist])
      ENDSELECT

What I want to happen is: when I click on my "Add" button, the string '!x!'
(just for testing, don't worry!) to appear at the bottom of the list. But
clicking on the button for the first time results in nothing, whilst
clicking it again causes the process to hang....
I guess LISTVIEW's aren't my thing ... :)

                           STATEMENT, v5
           -> with additions about newest developments <-
 
                      The future of Amiga E
 
                    by Wouter van Oortmerssen
 
The question I get most from programmers is: when will the new version
of E be out, what it will cost and what are it's features? since the
answer is of interest to just about anybody working with E, I'll try to
summarise it here.
 
First, my aim was to release a v2.5, however, I implemented a lot
of stuff that was originally meant for v3.0, so now I'm skipping v2.5,
and v3.0 will be the first release after v2.1b.
The drawback ofcourse is that it will yet take a little longer before
a new version comes out, and the good news is that we'll have v3.0
features like full OO-ness relatively early. but more to that later.
 
The most current _beta_ version of E is v2.7a, and already has the
following features:
 
- compilation to modules, one of the most important enhancements.
  this allows you to write sources with OBJECTs, PROCs and CONSTs etc
  in them, and have them compiled to a ".m" file for use in other programs.
  any thinkable datahiding scheme supported.
  The module system is very flexible and easy to use, and allows for
  extremely fast linking.
- error reconstruction: EC now exactly pinpoints the spot in the
  source that caused the error
- optimisations in the compiler: EC is significantly faster than
  EC2.1b, even with all the new features and code-optimisations.
- various optimisations in code-generation
- Parts of the compiler have been rewritten and datastructures
  reorganised for efficiency, this results in a reduction in EC's
  memory consumption with 40% to 50%
- default arguments a la C++: allows you to give parameters default
  values incase the caller leaves out an argument.
  PROC bla(a,b=1,c=NIL:PTR TO extrainfo)
- kick 3.0 modules
- object inheritance (see below for other OO features)
  lets you inherit object members and methods from other objects,
  and create hierarchies of datatypes with shared behaviour
  OBJECT circle OF location
- multiple returnvalues and multiple-value assignments.
  functions can now return more than one value, and assignment
  statements can store in more than one var.
  a,b,c:=func(); RETURN 1,2,3
- symbolhunks for use with profiler, debuggers etc.
- .o to .m file converter (for assembly)
- numerous small bugs fixed and small enhancements made
- register allocation
  v2.1b did hardly put variables in registers, thus code that depends
  largely on the time needed to access a variabele would be slower.
  EC can either compute the best possible register usage itself,
  or the programmer can assign registers.
- various new code optimisations, for different sorts of expressions,
  library calls etc. also some special opti's for 020+ machines.
- module caching: this feature allows EC to keep modules
  in memory between compilations. effectively this means that
  the first time you compile a source which needs 10 modules
  EC will load them all from disk, the second upto the n-th
  time it doesn't have to load any. Because the new E can have
  huge apps seperated over many modules, compile/link times for
  large programs can be incredibly fast.
- the NEW operator allows for quick and easy dynamic
  memory allocation, with automatic exception raising.
  NEW p; NEW [1,a,bla()]:obj
- increasing number of great modules for all sorts of tasks. the plan
  is that E will provide an enormous amount of these modules to allow
  quick programming of large, quality apps. v3.0 will _probably_ already
  have modules for:
  * easy font sensitive resizable auto-organising GUI's
  * both simple 3d vectors and fully fledged realtime
    double-buffered 3d filled vectors
  * protracker player
  * iff loader/saver etc.
  * hashing
  * easy file access
  * lexical analysing
  * garbage collected LISP-lists
  * all sorts of Amiga.lib and amiga support routines
  and much more. (this is just an example selection)
- a new SELECT OF that understands complex CASE's like
  CASE "a" TO "z", "A" TO "Z", "0" TO "9", "_"
  and is also much faster than the other SELECT
- Unification: this is a feature normally only found in
  high-level functional and logic programming languages. It
  allows for the pattern-matching of nested structures in
  expressions, and bind variables along the way. When used
  properly, it can greatly reduce programming time to implement
  complex algorithms involving dynamic datastructures.
  IF exp <=> [BLA,[BLERK,y,0],x] THEN ...
- lots of great external utilities:
  * Build, a full featured Make utility for E
  * E-Yacc (and probaly also E-Lex), parser and lexical
    analyser generators for E
  * o2m, converts your macro-assembler .o files to modules
- Datahiding with public/private.
  allows members and methods to be private, i.e. invisable for
  the user of a class.
- virtual methods and method inheritance.
  in the E Object Model, object-polymorhism plays a bigger role than
  in languages like C++ which also have fake (non-virtual) methods.
  A method in E is a PROC defined on an object, however it functions
  quite different from a PROC since which methods are invocated on
  an objects is determined at run time.
- much more free format source
- ability to dereference pointers beyond just one ".", new types
  allowed in OBJECTs.
- (very likely) an absolutely GREAT editor written in E, called EE
  (courtesy of Barry Wills), from which you can edit and compile
  your E sources. It does all the great things any modern editor
  can do an besides that it has many E specific features, such as
  folding on PROCs etc. a must-have.
 
(still missing from this are REALs, but they'll definitly be in the
next release.)
 
Last but not least there is the question what 3.0 will cost. Well,
I don't know myself: I'd like to sell it for a very low-profit price
so that everybody can easily affort it. probably this won't be much
more than the price for a shareware compiler. Also I'll plan on
distributing a PD demo version of v3.0. When I feel like it, I might
also let a commercial publisher take care of distribution etc., when
a suitable one comes with a good deal.
 
so, I hope all this information gave some of you an insight of what's
coming... 
 
Greetings to all E programmers in the world,
 
Wouter.

Subject: EPD

 
Hello all,
 
I'd like to inform you all (especially the germans among you)
that there exists a public-domain series for Amiga E called EPD,
with 4 disks out sofar. It contains sources, tips & tricks and
various stuff, most of it in german, and the material overlaps
somewhat with aminet dev/e, so I figure this would be interesting
for list members in germany who don't have FTP-access. for more
information, write to:
 
Jvrg Wach - Waitzstr. 75 - 24105 - Deutschland
 
If there is a lot of interest, I'm willing to upload archives of
the disks to aminet dev/e
 
finally, here's a bit from the 'LiesMichZuerst' (readme.1st) from
EPD #4 (in german):
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
 
    Wof|r steht EPD? F|r alle, die`s noch nicht wissen :
 
                      Amiga_E
                            Programmierer
                            Diskette
 
                   oder wenn du's lieber in Englisch mvchtest
 
                      Amiga_E
                            Programming
                            Disk. 
 
 
     Die EPD ist f|r jeden Amiga_E-User oder f|r jeden, der sich f|r
     Amiga_E interessiert, gedacht. Insbesondere soll die EPD ein
     Software-Pool in Amiga_E sein, um Anfdngern oder auch fortgeschrittenen
     die Mvglichkeit zu geben, aus den Programmen zu lernen oder noch nie
     dagewesene Programme zu vervffentlichen.
 
     Daniel und ich wollen f|r alle da sein, d.h. besser gesagt, Ihr sollt
     f|r alle da sein. Denn die EPD soll eine PD-Serie von Usern f|r
     User sein.
 
     Also, wenn Ihr mitmachen wollt, schickt uns Eure Beitrdge. Wir suchen
     alles, was mit dem Programmieren in Amiga_E zu tun hat, als da seien:
 
      - Programme, geschrieben in Amiga_E, mit oder ohne Sourcecode,
 
      - Tips & Tricks zur Programmierung,
 
      - Hinweise zu Compilern, Arbeitsumgebungen  und und und ...
 
      - und in der "Fragestunde" kvnnen Fragen zu Problemen gestellt und
        auch von euch beantwortet werden. Ist ein Versuch, mal sehen, was
        draus wird.
 
 
      Gleichzeitig habt ihr in der "Fragestunde" direkt die Mvglichkeit,
      Eure Fragen an den Designer und Ersteller der Amiga_E-Sprache und
      des Amiga_E-Compilers zu stellen.
 
      Wer die EPD haben will, schickt eine Leerdisk und einen mit
      1,30 DM frankierten, adressierten R|ckumschlag an eine der
      untenstehende Adressen, oder er schickt einfach 2,30 DM. Wir senden
      dann die gew|nschte Ausgabe zu.
 
      Wer allerdings ein AMIGA_E-Programm hat schickt nur die
      Diskette an Jvrg. Die Portokosten f|r den R|ckversand |bernehme
      Jvrg (was meine Frau wieder sagen wird?;-).
 
      Solltet Ihr aus dem Ausland kommen, dann schickt bitte 3,00 DM
      und eine Leerdisk an uns, da die Preise hierf|r leider etwas
      hvher sind.
 
      Wir freuen uns nat|rlich besonders |ber "Leerdisketten",
      auf denen sich bereits PD befindet.
 
      Wenn Ihr was vervffentlichen wollt, dann schickt auf der Leerdisk
      einfach Euren Beitrag mit.
 
 
    Zu Bekommen ist die EPD bei

   I too would like to know how too build a list for use with the Listview
gadget.  What I need to do is scan a directory or directories and then put
that list in a Listview gadget, then possibly change and update that list.
   I'm pretty much stumped on this one.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanx,

No, you have two lines the wrong way round here.

You should put the call with the $FFFFFFFF before you mess with the list. 
Then Intuition is forewarned and won't try to refresh the listview until 
you call with the correct list address.

You can't call this routine twice, since the node you're adding is part 
of E compiled code and it will try to use the same address for two 
different nodes. So that is why it is hanging.

For multiple nodes, you have to allocate some new memory using New or 
AllocMem or AllocVec. Just make sure that you free it before you quit. 
Try this:

DEF node:PTR TO ln,name:STRING
.
.
/* Call this as many times as you like */
Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA(win,gad,NIL,[GTLV_LABELS,$FFFFFFFF,0])
node:=AllocMem(SIZEOF ln,MEMF_CLEAR)
node.name:='!x!'
AddTail(lvlist,node)
Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA(win,gad,NIL,[GTLV_LABELS,lvlist,0])
.
.
.
/* Call this to clean up */
WHILE node:=RemHead(lvlist)
  FreeMem(node,SIZEOF ln)
ENDWHILE

OK? Remember though that all your entries will have the same name so you 
will also have to allocate memory for the names, maybe using :

StrCopy(s,'Hello',ALL)
node:=AllocVec(StrLen(s),MEMF_CLEAR)
CopyMem(s,node,StrLen(s)

Remember though that this memory also needs to be freed in the cleanup 
routine.

Hope that gave you a few pointers (bad pun :)

Cheers

WRT, the multiple-value assignments, how is (or might) this capability
different from the already available ability to have multiple assignments
"chained" in one statement?, e.g. :

   a:=b:=c:=func()

Aren't the AddTail() line and first Gt_Set..A() lines in
reverse order?  Also, Kenny, you need to have a 0 as the
last tag in your taglist:  [GTLV_LABELS,$FFFFFFFF,0] or
[GTLV_LABELS,$FFFFFFFF,TAG_DONE] (TAG_DONE is from
utilities/taglist.m).

-> What I want to happen is: when I click on my "Add" button, the string '!x!'
-> (just for testing, don't worry!) to appear at the bottom of the list. But
-> clicking on the button for the first time results in nothing, whilst
-> clicking it again causes the process to hang....
-> I guess LISTVIEW's aren't my thing ... :)

Also, you DON'T want to use static variables in dynamic
structures, such as this listview, unless you're sure
what's going on.  If that AddTail() is in any kind of
a loop, or a function that's called two or more times,
your setting yourself up by linking that static memory
to itself.

To demonstrate what I mean, compile and run this:

PROC fun()
  DEF f:PTR TO LONG
  f:=[1,2,3]
  WriteF('f@\d=[\d,\d,\d]\n', f, f[0], f[1], f[2])
ENDPROC f

PROC main()
  DEF x:PTR TO LONG
  x:=fun()
  x[0]:=9; x[1]:=8; x[2]:=7
  fun()
ENDPROC

Calling fun() puts the address of the static list
containing [1,2,3] into x in main().  Then the contents
of the list are changed in main() (huh!!!), so the next
time you call fun() you don't see what you might expect.

This is your brain:  __________________________

   And to the author of EPP (Barry something?), would you be interested in
a version of EPP with a new version of Eformat imbedded into it as an

	With a:=b:=c:=func(), the 3 variables (a,b and c) are equal to the
value returned by func().
	With a,b,c:=func(), a is equal to 1, b is equal to 2 and c is equal to
3, because func() has returned the 3 values 1,2,3.

Well this does not work. with one item, the borderdata is recognized, but with this kind of list... nothing happens :(


Well this example with BorderData is not what I want really to do, I take this
because it was the smallest example I find out in the IntuiSup.c file using
the IntuiSup.library.

So, the IntuiSup create the gadget with ONE function :
  glist:=IcreateGadgets(ri, gaddata, offx, offy, locale)

    glist : returned pointer to the gadget list,
    ri    : internal pointer used by IntuiSup
    offx, offy : x and y offset to place the text of all buttons
    gaddata : pointer to a GadgetData structures.

  gaddata := [ buttonkind, 
               flags, 
               x,y,w,h, 
               title, 
               textattr, 
               data1, data2, data3 ]

If I defined ONE gadget like gaddata above, I have this gadget displayed. But
when I make a list like you are saying Barry (well, with GadgetData and not 
BorderData :) I don't get ANYTHING....

Hope that my explanation will help !

In your example, a, b and c get the same value. In Wouter's example,
multiple (different!) values can be returned. Imagine this code:

DEF a,b,c,d=10
a,b,c:=func(d)
PROC func(value) RETURN value*value,-value,value*2

a will now be 100, b will be -10 and c becomes 20.

I hope this clears things up,

Re hi

I add another note :


> I think I can answer the "STATIC struct BorderData  test_border_data[]"
> question.

In the C example, the BorderData is a list (test_border_data[])
> 
> Try DEFining a variable (perhaps test_border_data), then:

> test_border_data:=[[4, 273, 33, 87, 25],[2, 275, 106, 95, 21],

>                    [INTUISUP_DATA_END]]

BUT this knid of list (I tried) is not accepted by the E...


Other NOTE :
I look into the E docs, WbArgs.e doesn't run under 1.3... So I tried this 
simple program :
  PROC main()
    DEF i
    FOR i:=1 TO 100 DO WriteF('\d',i)
  ENDPROC

It runs in a shell, but not in the workbench. The output window opens and 
closes without doing anything.... Strange !


3rd NOTE :
Someone, maybe you Trey, tells me to use the Delay() function... It doesn't do
anyhing, under 1.3 (I tried Delay(250), 5 seconds)

Bye, and thanx in advance

Has anyone had any problems with EFormat?  After it finishes processing my

the command line.  Then I type my next command or just hit return and it
gurus.  It does this every time and is definitely reproducable.  I'm using

	Actually, I was thinking something more along the line of :
IF arg_Eformat
	Eformat(buffer,flags)	/* No messy unstructured IF THENs ;-> */
ENDIF
	Where Eformat would be a part of EPP. Btw, I was looking at your
code, and I bet I could speed up overall processing time quite a bit. (By
reading in the whole source and parsing in memory.)

Try this:

DEF handle,oldstd

IF (handle:=Open('CON:0/0/640/200/My Adventure Game',NEWFILE))

  oldstd:=SetStdOut(handle)
  WriteF('Welcome to Zork XIV!\n')
  /*
   .
   . (The game code. Use the same functions as for cli windows, i.e ReadStr())
   .
  */

  Close(handle)
  SetStdOut(oldstd)
  WriteF('So long!\n')

ENDIF

First, you open a file. The file is actually a console window and it behaves
exactly like a cli window. The filename is 'CON:x/y/width/height/name'.
Of course you have to check that the window actually opened. That is the
reason for the IF statement.

Then you have to set the standard output handle to the handle of your newly
opened window. SetStdOut() does this for you, and it returns the old
standard output handle, in case you need it again.

Now you can use WriteF() and ReadStr() to your heart's content. Use Close()
to close the window, not CloseW(). Re-set the standard output if you wish
to make sure that output after the Close() call is sent to the cli window
that you ran the program from. (The 'So long' in the code above will appear
in your cli window)

Hope this helps,

In this case use :
       test_border_data:=[ 4, 273,  33, 87, 25,
                           2, 275, 106, 95, 21,
                           1, 397, 112, 97, 15,
                           3, 374,   6, 63, 14]:borderdata       

If you are not passing the number of gadgets you may find you also need 
another line in the above filled with 0's so that IntuiSup recongises 
that you've finished.

Hope this helps,

Hm, yeah.  I looked at the ccode in Intuisup distro archive.
The ccode uses static arrays of BorderData structures.  That
isn't the same as the above array of pointers to borderdata
structures.

Ok.  We're not going to get very far, very fast, by talking
about it abstractly.  I've never tried to do the equivalent
of static arrays of C structures in E, but I envision an
UGLY picture.  If you send me a small sample of E source code 
that works for ONE gadget, I'll play with it and see if I can
make it work for more than one.

Well, here, at the school, I don't have the module, but the INCLUDE file from

Subject: Some Questions


Hi all,

I have some questions concerning AmigaE.Perhaps someone has an answer.

1) Are the procedures in AmigaE to convert strings to ffp-numbers and
   back ? I would like to read a ffp-number from an ascii-file and display
   ffp-numbers at the console,so i think i'll need something like this.

2) Does anybody know how to detect an overflow when adding two LONGs ?
   Perhaps a short piece of code :

   DEF   a,b,c
         a := 1000000000
         b := 2000000000
         c := a+b

   This code will surely end up in an overflow.Instead of using the wrong
   result,i'd like to raise an exception.But how?

3) There's a library called gadgetoutline.library.It simplifies
   GUI-Programming without having to use an interface builder (e.g.
   GadToolsBox).It can be found on Fish-Disk 911.Does anybody know
   if there's an E-Interface for it ?

Thanks to all who help.

Subject: Re: EPP and stuff..

Hi again, Jason.

~8> 	Actually, I was thinking something more along the line of :
~8> IF arg_Eformat
~8> 	Eformat(buffer,flags)	/* No messy unstructured IF THENs ;-> */
~8> ENDIF
~8> 	Where Eformat would be a part of EPP. Btw, I was looking at your

That's what I thought, although I wasn't going to suggest it.

~8> code, and I bet I could speed up overall processing time quite a bit. (By
~8> reading in the whole source and parsing in memory.)

I'm sure it could be done.  I originally intended that EPP
be as memory efficient as possible (since at the time I was
running a 68000 with less than 1Meg of free ram).  It didn't
occur to me then that if one could compile an E program,
surely one could pre-process the same program without running
out of memory. :-)

EPP v1.1 could be a little unstable, so I was loathe to change
the IO routine since it worked, and proved to be as fast as 
Fgets().  I have had one bug report from Chad Freeman, but it 
didn't seem to be a rampant problem, so I haven't touched it.

My opinion is that it wouldn't be much worth anyone's time and
effort (except as a programming exercise) to do an overhaul on
EPP.  E v3.0 is right around the corner (I hope), and EPP will 
be of no more use except to those who decide to stick with E 
v2.1b.

The only endeavor worthy of the effort might be a meeting of
EPP, EHS, Eformat, and Mac2E.  And the real consideration
here is the prospective life expectency of any or all of these
utilities.  E v3.0 modules will kick EPP's butt, and EHS can
quickly and easily be converted to v3.0 modules.  That leaves 
Eformat and Mac2E, and the author of Mac2E, Lionel Vintenat, 
stated in his docs that Wouter is considering making macro 
preprocessing a feature in the next release of E.

So, unless Wouter delays the inclusion of macro preprocessing
(and I hope you don't, Wouter :-) only Eformat remains, dude.

Any opinions welcome.

	Ok, first, what version do you have, and second, try the command
line like this. 
'eformat >ram:Newfile.e oldfile.e'
   If you still have problems with it, give me a shout.. I'll take another
look at the code today and see if I can see anything I missed.

I have removed the user you specified from the list. In looking at the
Listserv logs I find that there have been some problems with the
automatic unsubscription feature. This is because the user specified
in the UNSUBSCRIBE line must specify their address in *exactly* the
same way it appears in the list. In this case, the UNSUBSCRIBE 
requests specified a user at kadewe.artcom.de, when the address 
used by the list was simply .artcom.de. 

Hope this solves your problems.

Disassemble the small "read" program that comes with Term... :^)

I don't really know but I do know you have to add the slider yourself

Subject: Drawing circles

Today's question:  How do you draw a circle in a window on the
workbench screen using graphics.library?  The only reference I
have is 1.3 Includes&Autodocs, but I'm working on a 4000/040 :^)
This is what I have so far but it crashes the amiga in a major way.
I thought intuition.library had a circle drawing function but
it doesn't after all, at least in 1.3.
The program worked 100% till I put in the AreaXxxx calls...




MODULE 'intuition/intuition'
MODULE 'graphics/rastport'

DEF fortune,  eightwin,  class
DEF arinf:PTR TO areainfo
DEF arbuf[30]:ARRAY

PROC main()
  arinf := [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]:areainfo

  IF eightwin := OpenW(0,0,200,200,
                       (IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS OR IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW),
                       (WFLG_DRAGBAR OR WFLG_DEPTHGADGET OR
                        WFLG_CLOSEGADGET OR WFLG_ACTIVATE),
                       'Window',0,1,0)

    fortune := ['one',
                'two',
                'three',
                'four',
                'five',
                'six',
                'seven']

    Colour(1,0)
    InitArea(arinf,arbuf,6)     /* seems to crash near here */
    AreaEllipse(stdrast,100,100,40,40)
    AreaEnd(stdrast)

    WHILE (class := WaitIMessage(eightwin)) <> IDCMP_CLOSEWINDOW

      IF (class=IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS) AND (MsgCode()=SELECTUP)
        Box(50,94,190,102,1)
        Colour(2,1)
        TextF(50,100,'\s',ListItem(fortune,(Rnd(7))) )
/*        TextF(50,120,'myrast = \d',stdrast)  for debugging */

    ENDWHILE

How do you draw circles in a window on the workbench screen using
graphics.library?

I got "AreaExamples" from aminet which would be perfect except that
it's in C and I don't know C.  I can follow what they are doing but I
don't know what the "*" thing does in C so I don't know how to make
my variables.

How do you print in other fonts in an intuition window???

I used OpenDiskFont to get 'times 18' from disk,

And yes I do have the foreground color (APen) set to something
visible.

1.3 doesn't have auto-console opening, I don't know when it was
introduced but my 4000 has it, it's quite handy.

But it was reported that this doesn't work.  It now occurs to me why it
wouldn't work.  I ended with [INTUISUP_DATA_END]]... the brackets around
INTUI.. should be taking out, thus:

 test_border_data:=[[4, 273, 33, 87, 25],[2, 275, 106, 95, 21],
                    [1, 397, 112, 97, 15],[3, 374, 6, 63, 14],
                    INTUISUP_DATA_END]

Might be the better way.  My apologies <thud>.  I see no reason why you can't
have lists within lists, though... should work (heck, I seem to recall having
done it).  Whether or not it actually works with your routine remains to be
seen <sigh>.  You might have to try the following:

 test_border_data:=[4, 273, 33, 87, 25, 2, 275, 106, 95, 21, 1, 397, 112, 97,
                    15, 3, 374, 6, 63, 14, INTUISUP_DATA_END]

One of these has GOT to be it, though... unless there's yet another thing I'm
not catching.

I believe that it wouldn't work because E would evaluate the right side
before assigning a value to the left side. Otherwise you could never do
somthiung like this:

x:=x+4

Hmm The only thing I can suggest just with that, is to add ,NIL to your
taglist ...,[GTLV_LABELS,lvlist,NIL])

taglists are supposed to be terminated with a TAG_DONE which evaluates to
NIL.

Maybe ensure you have the correct window ptr for win too.

I hate them too. We're stuck with them  :-)

It's a bit of a pain to do.
Once you have initialized the list like this:

DEF listv:PTR TO LONG

listv:=[0,0,0]
listv[0]:=listv+4
listv[2]:=listv

You then add NODEs to the list using AddTail() to add them to the end
and AddHead() to add them to the start. listv will be updated to keep
pointers to the first and last NODE.
A NODE is of object type 'ln' in 'exec/nodes'

To move along the list of NODEs you find the pointer of the first node
in listv[0] and then the next pointer is in the node as
node.succ  (successor I guess)

e.g.

DEF node:PTR TO ln

node:=listv[0]
  WHILE node
    WriteF('"\s"\n',node.name)
    node:=node.succ
  ENDWHILE


to remove a node from the list, you use Remove(node)

AddTail(), AddHead() and Remove() are all in exec.library.

There's a lot more to learn about it, but that's a start.

Right again.. I fell for that trap when I first started playing with
listview gadgets and lists.

I think for Amiga-E beginners, New() would be better  :-)
DOn't forget MODULE 'exec/memory'

Of course it would be better to:
node.name:=String(80)
StrCopy(node.name,?,ALL)
Who knows where and how '!x'! is created or pulled from  :-)

Ahh you mentioned it  :-)
Why not:

node.name:=String(StrLen('Hello')) /*or whatever the estring will be*/
StrCopy(node.name,the_string,ALL)

Using AllocMem and AllocVec seems a bit of overkill when E will do it
for us.

Not neccesarily if E functions are used to create the memory.
New() and String() for instance.

If I read it right, the question was how will it differ..
will it mean that we can do this:

a,b,c := d,e,f := g,h,i := func(j)

since you can multiple assign using a:=d:=g

and you will be able to return multiple return values, how
will it affect toing both at the same time??  :-)

(maybe it will be like this  :-)

a:=b , c:=d , e:=f :=func(g)

	Before starting Mac2E, I asked Wouter about future macro
processing in next Amiga E release. At this moment, he answered me
that he will think about it but nothing was sure. After announcing
to this list the release of Mac2E, I asked him again about it (I
didn't want to spend time supporting or improving Mac2E if Amiga E
v3.0 comes out in 3 weeks with hundred times better feature in macro
processing than Mac2E !). And this time, he answered me that Amiga E
v3.0 won't support macro processing, but that the v3.0 module system
is very powerfull, and make most uses of include files unnecessary.
So I plan to improve macro processing feature of Mac2E (speed), but
I won't do anything for file inclusion or for a make tool as I said
in the docs.
	But, if someone want to do a "meeting of EPP, EHS, EFormat and
Mac2E", it's all right for me. In fact, I think that a sort of
"graphics make tool" should be nice. If someone wants to start it,
mail me ! I will be happy to do a "MUI-version" of it.

>So, unless Wouter delays the inclusion of macro preprocessing
>(and I hope you don't, Wouter :-) only Eformat remains, dude.

	I hope too, but I'm afraid you have to use Mac2E (too bad ;-))
for a while if you need macros in your program !

>Any opinions welcome.

	Here is one !

	Here are some equivalences C<=>E which may help you...

	Inside declarations :
char *var1	<=>	DEF var1:PTR TO CHAR
object1_type_name *var2	<=>	DEF var2:PTR TO object1_type_name

	Inside "classic" section code :
(*var1)='a'	<=>	^var1:="a" or PutChar(var1,"a")
var2->field_name_of_object1=3	<=>	var2.field_name_of_object1:=3

You wrote:

| C so I don't know how to make my variables.

The '*' symbol means a few things, depending on how it's being used.

If you see something like 'char *c' then it is specifying 'c' as a variable
that is a pointer (sorta like E's {c}, but not quite).  If you later in the
same program see "*c = 'M'" it refers to the value in the area of memory
pointed to by 'c'.

However, if it was 'char c', and later you see 'mystery-variable = *c' then the
'*' refers to the address of the variable 'c' (that is, it's EXACTLY like E's
use of {}).

SO...The following 'chart' might help when effecting these conversions:

C                                     E
================================================================================
char c;                               DEF c
  c = 'M';                              c := "M"
  mystery_variable = *c;                mystery_variable := {c}

char *c;                              DEF c
  c = "Eat more quiche.";               c := 'Eat more quiche.'
  mystery_variable = *c;                mystery_variable := Char(c)
                                         /* NOTE: this is not advised
                                            in strict 'E' coding.. I'm
                                            simply emphasising something. */

It gets weirder when you start messing around with OBJECTS/structs, but
hopefully this will be enough to get the basic principals down (and, hopefully,
I didn't screw up somehow).

	Hmm. Good point. I was going on the assumption that E 3.0 would be
delayed yet more. After all, wasn't 2.5 originally supposed to be released
in August or October 93? Ah well, no biggy. Just added some more features
to Eformat, and it'll be up on Aminet today. (If Wuarchive hasn't crashed
again.)
	As for Eformat being the only one of the bunch left, I guess we
just have to get Wouter to throw it into EC as well! Whaddaya say,
Wouter? ;>

>So, unless Wouter delays the inclusion of macro preprocessing
>(and I hope you don't, Wouter :-) only Eformat remains, dude.

	And I guess it's going to be around for quite a while too. I
really, really would like it be part of the pre-processor, as having it a
seperate program would speed up overall compilation time, but I guess
it'll work as a standalone, because I really can't see Wouter throwing it
in. (I've seen the results of his LAYOUT switch in srcgen .4 <shudder>)

Also, Neeeee. Well, I saw the GadOutLines.library. It seems to be a great

What do you mean, with interface. If it is an Editor that uses 
GadOutlines.library to vreate your GUI. I believe the is nnone...
If it is a module, you can compile the pragmas (GadOutlines.h) with the
SAS2Module programm, and the Include/gadOuLines.h into .i and then with
Iconvert, to a libraries E module

Hope thats helps :)

Subject: New Project! C2E!


	Ok, this is going to be my latest project, while I work the bugs
out of Dirj (my dir utility in the works.) I have looked at a lot of C
source, and the only thing I can see huge problems with (or any, for that
matter), is Float handling. Here's what I have covered in design phase,
tell me if I missed something. 

- Constant strings, covered. (Global list, with list[INDEX_NAME], and
INDEX_NAME being the old constant string name.
- Structures are easy.
- Dereferenced pointers are going to be a little harder, but just deal
with them the same way you do in E, with PTRs.. This will be a LOT
easier with 3.0... Wouter??
- Round up all extern variables and put them in one big DEF.
- A lot of C stuff is just plain ignorable, ie. the definition of some
external functions, when they're just in another module.
- include calls replaced with calls to PMODULE and MODULE respectively.
- Maintain a database of stupid C types, and convert them to E's big
three. With proper conversion of the source you should not have to worry
about types.

	Hmm.. There was some more stuff but I cannot remember it. Any
comments are welcome, preferrably on the list for open discussion.

Subject: Amiga E bug! (I'm pretty sure.)

	I seem to have found a bit of a bug in E. When trying to track
down memory loss in Dirj, through a whole lot of debug code, I managed to
track down the loss to a routine that frees a linked list of structures.
The structure is something like this.

OBJECT file
	next:LONG
	name:LONG 	/* Name is ptr to String*/
	date:LONG	/* Date is ptr to datestamp */
	size:LONG /* Just a long */
ENDOBJECT

	Ok, name and date are allocated with String and New respectively.
The freeup routine uses Dispose on both of them, ie Dispose(file.name) ;
Dispose(file.date), then Dispose(file), which was also created with New().
Dispose frees up the datestamp, but not the filename. Now, supposedly all
memory is freed at the end of the program. This is not working. Every time
I free up a list, I lose all the string memory.
	Now, as a solution, to be fair to Wouter, I tried DisposeLink().
Which is really a dumb thing to have to do, I must say. It worked, but
obviously Strings' next fields start uninitialized because it was taking a
long time and still wasn't freeing all memory.
	The big kicker here is that all memory is allocated with E, and E
isn't freeing up all of it at the end, even with CleanUp(). This is really
screwing up my development, and is a really silly bug. If it wasn't for
the fact that I like Estrings, I would be using AllocRemember already.
	Wouter, any suggestions? Anyone?

	Please keep in mind that I do know what I am doing, and am not
just accusing E of my faults. If you like Wouter, I will send you the code
and you can check it yourself, but since this is Shareware in progress,
the only other people getting it are the beta testers.

The "* thing" is the indirection operator. It works like this:

Say you have a pointer called "ptr".

If you use "ptr" you're talking about the address (ie: what ptr
actually holds). If you say "*ptr" it's referring to what the pointer
actually points to. I don't program in E, so I'm not sure how
you're used to dealing with pointers... In fact, I couldn't make much sense
of the code you posted, so I couldn't tell what was wrong with it.

I think you mentioned that you have some of the 1.3 RKM's. Since the area
functions didn't change (at least, I don't *think* they changed... and
they'd still be downward compatible) you should look in those for
information.

BTW, your problem might be that you never declare stdrast. Of course,
AmigaE might declare it for you (like I said, I don't program in E).

I have version 1.2.  Here are the individual cases:

if I type:			I get:

eformat (no arguments)		my command line back (no problems)
eformat file.e			output then guru (suspend/reboot) 8000 0003
eformat >file2.e file.e		guru, no output
eformat file.e >file2.e		output to file, then guru

It's just a guess, but I think that resources are being deallocated
improperly.  I'm not being critical.  I'm not very good with E yet, or I
would try fixing it myself.

Thanks.

Oh, I'm using 2.04 and in my WBStartup drawer I have the following:

AddTools
DropBox
Exchange
MagicMenu
RexxMast
RTPatch
Storage
Yak

Also I run NickPrefs at startup.  However, I just did that recently, and
Eformat demonstrated this problem before I installed that.  Honestly, I
don't think it could be one of the utilities I have listed above, but I
list them just in case.

Hi all,

I want to save the file list we can find in the rtfilelist of the 
ReqTools.library. How can I make a copy of this list into my own variable.
I create an ARRAY OF LONG, how can I copy the rtfilist.name into this ?

  DEF my_list[100] : ARRAY OF LONG,
      filelist     : PTR TO rtfilelist,
      filename[60] : STRING

  /* .... */

  StrCopy(filename,filelist.name,ALL)

And now I want to save the filename into my_list....

Thanx for any help.

Subject: E Lists and TagLists Question


In a reply to 'More GUI problems' someone suggested that each direct list
(for example [GA_DISABLED,TRUE]) should contain the TAG_DONE value, which is
in fact NIL. (So my example should become [GA_DISABLED,TRUE,TAG_DONE].)

My question is: Isn't a list always terminated with a NIL automatically by
Amiga E ? The reason this question arose was the fact that a list is the
counterpart of a string, and a string IS zero terminated.

Keep E-ing,

Subject: Address of object member in 3.0?


In a followup on 'More GUI problems' this was suggested as a solution for
initializing a listheader (exec list).

I know this code works ok, but I just wonder if we can do {listheader.tail}
in the Amiga E 3.0 release? This looks cleaner, and is equal to the syntax
in C, where something like *listheader.tail is used.

No such luck.  I was appalled to find out it exists only in

Once you get by the skimpy instructions, listviews are

Subject: Thanks for the help

Hi All,

  Thanks for the help in answering my questions. Thanks to Magnus for
his example to my window question.

  I had seen a similar program in the E examples, but didn't want to
really mess with it till I had an idea as to what they were doing. 
Thanks again Magnus for explaining this to me.

  Here is what I've decided to start with for my program:


/* My Adventure in E */

PROC main()
  DEF command[80]:STRING, con
  IF con:=Open('con:1/1/640/400/Adventure in E',NEWFILE)
    Write(con,'This is my frist program in E!\n',STRLEN)
    WHILE StrCmp(command,'QUIT',ALL)=FALSE
      Write(con,'COMMAND>',STRLEN)
      ReadStr(con,command)
      UpperStr(command)
    ENDWHILE
    Close(con)
   ENDIF
 ENDPROC


(TAAA DAAA), Well that's it. It's not fancy, but it's a start and it
works. The next thing is to have it check the screen size and open the
window (or I guess I should say console) accordingly.

I havn't had time to do more than just type in the above and get it 
working. If I wanted to open more than one console, and draw a map in it,
I could define it as, say, mapcon and then open it with:

    IF mapcon:=Open('mapcon:xx/xx/xxx/xxx/XXXXX',NEWFILE)
    ENDIF

or something along that line. Then to write to that console with:

   Write(mapcon,'Whatever',STRLEN)

Am I one the right track with this.

I'm sure I'll have lots more questions later as I try to implement this.
As soon as I get enough written so that it resembles a game I'll post it
to the list and maybe y'all can show me some better ways to do some of
the things I've done.

I like being on this list. When I tried to learn C I had noone around
to ask questions like this to and after awhile just gave up on it.

What little I have done with E I really like, and with the help of everyone
on the list I'm sure I'll go alot farther with it.

Thanks for everyone's help so far

later

Hi

 I've been thinking about what I would like to do with this game
I've started working on.

 First of all let me say that I've wanted to do this type of game
right after I first got my first Amiga 500. I had lots of experience
righting in Basic so I started there. After many, many, many lines of
code I had the basic (no pun intended :) program. It would draw my map,
I could move my little character around, it made sure he didn't walk 
though walls, and made sure that doors were unlocked before they could
be opened, and opened before being allowed to go thru. It also knew where
the character was; courtyard, building1, building2,.....etc.,etc.

 This was ok but ssslllooowwwww. So I purchased a Basic compiler, that
was faster but It would sometimes do funny things. Ok, let's learn C.
Not very easy when you don't have someone to ask questions about things
you don't understand. I was able to do general C stuff but never really
figured out the Amiga specific stuff.

 Now there's AmigaE, which to me seems easier than C, and once you get
the basics you can do a lot with it. With the mailing-list I can ask
questions to all sorts of E programmers, and somebody will have an answer.
(if I had, had access to a C list I probably would not have given up on it)

 I don't know who on the list plays or programs games, but here are some
ideas that I have in mind. Maybe someone can look it over and make some more
suggestions.


   1) It will be an adventure game. In the past year or so I have
      been playing NetHack and would like to implement some of the
      features that I like in this game.

   2) I would like for the player to be able to create different 
      types of characters so that they would be able to play using
      different strategies.

   3) Be able to play different types of games through the use of
      some type of module system. Maybe the game would be a basic
      engine for the game. Maybe even be able to play different
      themes (Fantasy, Sci-fi, Horror, etc.).

   4) Be able to improve the character from one module to the next.

   5) Create a module builder so that players can create their own
      modules for play and to create a module archive for other players

I've got other ideas but those are the main ones of the top of my head.
Any suggestions will be welcomed. Maybe once I get enough written so that
it looks like a game I can get some of you to beta test it. Will let you
know when I get that far.

later

... other stuff...

Maybe you've tried this already (you mention DisposeLink()...) but an E
String (from a STRING declaration or String() call) or E list (from a LIST
declaration or List() call) *MUST* be deallocated with DisposeLink(), not
Dispose(), if you want to deallocate it before the program ends.  You
didn't make it clear whether you'd left out all DisposeXXX()'s and let the
CleanUp() routine deallocate everything...  I hope I'm not making an obvious
remark, but check that complex typed things (E Strings and E Lists) are only
deallocated by CleanUp() or DisposeLink().  Everything else (except static
things like immediate lists and string constants) can be deallocated with
Dispose() (or in CleanUp()).

In any case, leaving out all Dispose() and DisposeLink() calls should mean
that CleanUp() works properly.  Again, I hope this suggestion is not
something you've already tried...

For a really complex program you might be playing with the program's
process structure.  If this is the case you might have messed up the
user data field which is what I think E uses to keep track of allocated
memory... That may be another thing to check.

I hope this is helpful (and not obvious and annoying...).

I've spent a goodly chunk of this afternoon chasing a guru, and once
I narrowed it down, I found that I haven't a clue quite what is going
on.  I have what I would have thought is absolutely vanilla code:

    DEF grid:PTR TO CHAR
    DEF p:PTR TO CHAR
    
    grid := New(<big>)
    
    p := grid
    FOR i := 1 to 10 DO ^p++ := "'"
    
What I discovered, thoroughly to my surprise, is that the construct
   ^p++
increments p by *four*.  Why does it do that?  If i just do a
    p++
it only increments it by 1, as it should, but once I stick in the
indirect things get wierd.  Any hints about what I'm misunderstanding
about this?

Thanks

Oh... how I would LOVE to see this, but I think you'll find the project a lot
harder than you originally thought...

[list o' stuff deleted]

Take a look at how E and C handle FOR loops.  Also, note the differences in how
C handles an evaluation compared to E (E works left-right, C works according to
algebraic rules).  Examine the REPEAT/do{} differences, too...

It'd be an extremely ugly project.. especially if you came across one of those
extremely arcane C for() statements like, uh...

for (s.p = voodoo; bjorn->next; i++);

Extremely ugly, but entirely possible with C.  As a matter of fact, I had to
jump through some unpleasant hoops while converting mk3d.c to mk3d.e (mk3d.e is
available at Aminet somewhere, for the interested.. makes 3-d images with text
characters.. source comes with it).

Good luck, though.. if you can do it, I think there will be a lot of cheering.

	Well, that is a bit weird. I've looked at the program, and it is
fine, as far as I can see. The only thing I can see that might be even
possibly causing it guru would be the stack imitating code. What I would
suggest is this: First, dl Eformat 1.3 whenever it gets validated. Minor
changes, but it does work. I am on a friends 2000 right now and it has
NEVER crashed or gurued on him.. He has a 2000 with 2.05, Gforce 030, and
is running Magic WB. 2. Try it from a bare cli. If it still does it,
without any of those programs, (Magic menus comes immediately to mind as
being crap, but I can't remember.) then I really have no clue. All
resources are being freed.  Eformat loses no memory, and as far as I know,
doesn't have any hits. But then again, I could be wrong.

Sorry, this one is WAY off. the above code will NOT compile. You'll get an
error. The * is used for three things in C:

1. multiplying (yay)
2. declaring a pointer
3. pointer indirection

The first is the familiar old: a=b*c that even BASIC has...

The second is used like this:

char *c; /* c is a pointer to a char */

The third is used like this:

char b;
...
b=*c; /* Now b holds the value c pointed to */

The * operator *cannot* be used to find the address of something. That
wouldn't make sense. If it could work either way then how do you know the
"b=*c" in the above isn't "make b hold the address of c"? To find the
address of something you use the address of operator, which in C is the
ampersand (&). ie:

char *a;
char b='X';
...
a=&b; /* a points at b */

The C code you posted would actually give an error like:

"ERROR!: expecting (char **) found (char)"
or GCC's wonderful:
"invalid type argument of `unary *'"

("unary *" is the indirection operator, while "binary *" is the
multiplication operator...)

Did you open the window with OpenW() or with OpenWindowTagList() ?

If the second choice then set stdrast to the window's rport.

3.0, is 2.5 even available yet, as far as I know that was to be the first

Though I don't know what the problems are I'd suggest checking RTPatch, if was

Two problems:

1)  You don't check the value of grid after the New() call (unless you've got
    an automatic exception handler on it that you haven't mentioned). I hope
    I'm not being obvious by suggesting you check the return value is not
    NIL before using it via p.
2)  The ^ operator is really only to be used in conjunction with {<var>},
    which gets a LONG address.  So that's why ^ refers to LONG values (i.e.,
    your pointer is then assumed to be a PTR TO LONG).  What you wanted to
    write is:

       FOR i:=1 TO 10 DO p[]++:="'"

    I made this mistake, too, and was quickly put right by Wouter himself.
    He frowns on uses of {<var>} and ^, and says we ought to use [] etc.
    I think I agree with him...

I have a project similar to this I'm working on when I'm not doing much
else.  my OBJECT is similar to yours.

Odd, because I also use New() and String() for similar fields, and I also
use Dispose() to free up the memory. It works ok here. I get every byte back
that my program uses. I can't explain what the problem is unfortunately.

Just going off track a bit here, have you found a suitable and fast way of
drag selecting multiple files in the window? That's where I'm having the
most problems.

Also, it's a great excersize doing a project like this. I learned how to
make appwindows and appicons. My project lets you drop any disk or drawer
icon on the appicon and it will automatically load that path into the
dirutil.  I also have made it so that doubleclicking the appicon will
iconify/uniconify the window (this project doesn't open it's own screen)

One other thing I'm stuck on is with a device/volume/assign list. I want to
be able to show it similar to the way ASL shows it ie:


DEVICENAME:   VOLUMENAME:             xx% full
DEVICE2:      VOLUME2:                yy% full
C:                                    Assign
CLIPS:                                Assign

etc...
But... no matter which way I do it, I either end up with devices I don't
want
(SER:  AUX: PRT: PAR: etc)  or I have no devices at all, just volumes and
assigns...   the second option would be OK if I knew how to get the device
name from the volume name..  e.g. given I have a volumename of
AmigaLibDisk930,  how do I find from that the device it is in?
e.g. DF3:

At the moment I'm just showing ALL devices/volumes and assigns. Will cause
some
problems if someone decided to try and view the contents of PAR:  :-)

	Hey, I like the sounds of this. I myself am going to be converting
Fangband into E with the C2E converter when/if it gets done, so I know the
temptation. Good luck, and feel free to ask me for help.. I've done a lot
of stuff with the console, so I can help you for sure, though I know lots
of other people on here will love to help out as well.

	Well, obvious, but not annoying :>. Yes, I've tried it all three
ways. Using Dispose(). (Which really should work on String() allocated
stuff. This is an overs ight, in my opinion.), and with DisposeLink(), and
CleanUp(). When I read the docs again, I figured, ah, DisposeLink, my
mistake, but not only did it not work, the program, when using this code,
generated over 10 megs of enforcer hit logs. (After this the 4000 ran out
of memory.). When I try it without enforcer on my A 1200, it doesn't
deallocate the memory, and just takes a long time pretending to do it. (I
am assuming this is because Strings next field start uninitialized and it
was trying to deallocate linked strings, but I really don't want to have
to initialize these damn fields in speed important code.)
	But, as far as I can see, it's a bug. If I can make myself, I'll
try Link()ing the Strings to 0, and see what happens tonight. This is
really dumb. Argh. Ah well, I shouldn't bitch, E is a truly great
language, so I can forgive it a few flaws.

	Well, I certainly haven't touched it. I'm trying to make the
program as system friendly as humanly possible. (I absolutely hate how
Dirwork 1.62 and DirOpus 4.01 crash on my 1200.)

>I hope this is helpful (and not obvious and annoying...).

	Well, thanks for the attempt in any case, it was much appreciated.
Is it possible you are one of the legendary beta testers of E 2.7?

	How is this arcane?

	Well, yes, it is ugly, but most of it has been designed. I could
type it all in, but it would be a horrible pain. My god i hate this stupid
Mac. Float is hard.
 Order of operations, well, that's quite easy. Just have an expression
evaluator that converts algebraic notation (the real way, I might add.),
to E's non ordered interpretation. (With brackets and such.)
	Case in point. I started working on C2E about a week ago. It now
pretty much successfully converts .h files to E. I'm really not sure what
to do with the pragma stuff though. (The only C book I have is Amiga C for beginners, which
really bites.)
	But, I would like to make this a list project if at all possible.
Any example code, algorithims for problems would be greatly appreciated.
Once I get the .h converter working 100%, I'll put a preliminary version in dev/e. (Mind you,
it's just converting it to .e, not .m.)
	One thing though, complex c code with lots of x.y.z dereferenced
stuff is going to be VERY ugly. At least until we get an E that supports that.

I'm not having any hassles with them myself. I just hate working with them

Subject: crashing from workbench

I have a program I've been playing with for some time and always from the
shell.  Today I decided to make an icon for it and see how it went.
It didn't  :-(   Alert 80000004
After spending some time debugging, I found that it crashes upon actually
loading it??  I have...

PROC main()
  DEF <some variables>
  WriteF('You made it this far\n')
..........
other code
..........

According to the reference doc, Amiga E will open a console window for us
if we use WriteF() when the program is run from workbench.
Previous programs have proven this true. This program, however, causes
an Alert even before the window is opened!?!?!
All I've done before that line is DEFined some variables.
The program does what I expect it to do, when run from CLI.
I don't think it has anythng to do with whether there is an Output
available for WriteF() because I can replace that line with:

DisplayBeep(NIL)

and it crashes before that even!

Any suggestions??

Almost. The IF statement should read:

    IF mapcon:=Open('con:xx/xx/xxx/xxx/XXXXX',NEWFILE)

CON: is a AmigaDOS device just like df0: or dh0: but mapcon: means nothing
to AmigaDOS.
The program would compile fine, but when you run it, you will get a requester
telling you to "Insert disk "mapcon" in any disk drive".

Just use different variables for different windows, and then you're on
the right track.

BTW, wouldn't it be easier to open a normal window for the map, and use
Line() to draw in it? Opening a console window for this means that you have
to use ascii characters to make up the map. Just a thought.

See you,

Subject: Programmer Project Interface Source

This is the source code for PPI, which I just posted to Aminet.  You can
get the source from there too, but I wanted to make sure all the E'ers got
a shot at it (not like we look at every little upload on Aminet eh?).

The docs are in the Aminet distribution too, if you have more questions.

Mail me for questions about this (platt@mhd1.moorhead.msus.edu).

Do NOT flood the list with questions.

Oh, be sure to edit out my .signature from the end of this mail message
and edit out this prelude too.  Just reminding everyone!  :+)

Ok, as far as I know, there is no more version 2.5, but a FUTURE 3.0 which is
not yet released. I can say that, because Wouter dos send me the doc 3.0 for 
the french translation... Or he forget it !

About the french translation, I've now to tranlate, something about 50 Ko of
datas. Next week, I'll send the docs to Wouter...

Bye !

Subject: C2E

Hi,

I see for some weeks, that the program C2E may convert C code to E code.
Is it right ? Wher can I find it... I saw in Aminet dev/e in berlin and uni-kl
but nothing new... I can't have acce to the US... I takes so much time, that
I'm always disconnected..

Thanx

Subject: IntuiSup

Hi all

Well, Barry, I try what you said with the gadgetdata form the IntuiSup.library.
Hey, that works fine ! My program looks very nice now ! and most of all,
I discover that this library, under WB 1.3 allows you to access to the all
capabilities of the system 2.0... (locale, 3D look, all 2.0 gadgets)

If someone want to know more about This library, mail me or in the ML. I'll
send a doc, made by myself....

>> How do you print in other fonts in an intuition window???
I got this to work thanks to somebody's source posted on here the
other day.  I'll answer these questions anyway for other people who
might be having trouble.


>What function are you using to 'print'?
TextF

>Did you open the window with OpenW() or with OpenWindowTagList() ?
>If the second choice then set stdrast to the window's rport.
I used OpenW()

The problem was my textfont structure it seems.
Originally I had something like (Don't take this literally, it is just
out of my head)
myfont := ['times.font',18,0,1]
or something similar.  This didn't work for some reason.
By unscrupulously copying that other guy's source :^) I changed to
something along the lines of
myfont.name := 'times.font'
myfont.ysize := 18
etc. etc.
that's what made it work.

I've been working on a series of small useless programs such as
a starfield, a bouncing line, and the piece de resistance, the
Magic 8 Ball toy simulator :^), I will post them sometime in the
near future, for beginners to look at.

Have fun
Alan

yes, I want this example. I'm try to have a list view with the IntuiSup.library
But I don't know how to pass the list of text...

Or does anybody else have an example ?

Subject: Requesters (Requestors?)

Hello All!
This question is not really E specific and it probably is an Amiga
programmer FAQ but since there are so many bright people out there, I
thought this would be a great place to start...:-)

My confusion comes from reading the Libraries manual (3rd ed.) as concerns
requesters. It seems if you want to open one, you have three possibilities:

1. Fill out a requester structure/record/object-list. Good for pre-version
36 operating system. I do not want to do this because you cannot use
gadtools gadgets in such a requester.

2. Use the Easy request or auto-request function. This is good for simple
yes-no type requesters which have perhaps a couple of lines of explanation
but are really quite limited.

3. Here is where I'm not too sure what's going on: open a sub-window which
might be more along the lines of what I want to do. This sub-window could
have many gadgets in it, use gadtools and allow the user to move it
around the screen. The manual makes reference to the main window's IDCMP
port as if somehow the two windows can share the same port. How is that done?
I have also seen programs such as excellence! the word-processor where
requesters which open do not block input to the main window but rather
function as if they were separate programs (threads?) Are these requesters
actually mini-windows with their own IDCMP port? How could you handle
something like that in your program?

I know that an add-on library like Reqtools would do the job quite well but
before going that route, I'd like to try the system-provided routines. Any
help is of course greatly appreciated. :-)
