@NODE About_EDTView "About EDTView"

EDTView 0.5 is a small and simple IFF, GIF, PCX, BMP, JPG Viewer.

It is also a simple image conversion tool. It will save images in
IFF ILBM format so you can load in a GIF & save it as an IFF.

It also allows you to change the images built in screenmode before 
saving so you could for example change a picture from PAL:High Res
to SUPER72:Low Res. Sometimes the datatypes give wrong screenmodes
when they load in files (EG. the JPG datatype) so you can adjust this
before you save it.

@NODE Why_bother? "Why bother?"

Good question. There are MANY fine image conversion packages available for the
Amiga & I do not intend to compete with them. 8-) This just started out as a
programming exercise to see how easily I could write an IFF viewer using the E
programming language. A few days later, and here it is.

@NODE Usage "Usage"

Simply type edtview from the CLI or click on its icon from workbench.
A file requester will open asking you to select a file to load.
If the file is recognised, edtview will print out some details of the file &
then open up a screen & display the file. Heres the tricky bit. The options
are available via pull down menus but depending on the color scheme of the
file you are viewing you may not be able to see them properly. They are:

@{" ABOUT__Shortcut_RightAmiga-A " Link ABOUT__Shortcut_RightAmiga-A}
@{" MODE___Shortcut_RightAmiga-M " Link MODE___Shortcut_RightAmiga-M}
@{" SAVE___Shortcut_RightAmiga-S " Link SAVE___Shortcut_RightAmiga-S}
@{" QUIT___Shortcut_RightAmiga-Q " Link QUIT___Shortcut_RightAmiga-Q}
@ENDNODE

@NODE ABOUT__Shortcut_RightAmiga-A "ABOUT__Shortcut_RightAmiga-A"
This displays information about the 
picture file & the author information.

@ENDNODE

@NODE MODE___Shortcut_RightAmiga-M "MODE___Shortcut_RightAmiga-M"

This pops a screenmode requester up 
allowing you to change the screenmode.

@ENDNODE

@NODE SAVE___Shortcut_RightAmiga-S "SAVE___Shortcut_RightAmiga-S"
Save the picture as IFF-ILBM. 
A file requester will prompt you for a filename

@ENDNODE

@NODE QUIT___Shortcut_RightAmiga-Q "QUIT___Shortcut_RightAmiga-Q"

Quit this fine program.

@NODE What's_a_datatype? "What's a datatype?"

A datatype is something CBM added in KS 3.0. One of the best things they ever
did. Datatypes provide transparent data conversion to programmers. So
basically, all you have to do is write a picture viewer that handles a
standard IFF (but even easier than that) file & leave the rest up to
someone else. As long as a datatype exists for that file format, the
conversion is done for you. So far there are PD GIF,JPG,PCX,and BMP
picture datatypes available as well as the ILBM datatype supplied by
CBM. There is also Animation datatypes in WB3.1.

@NODE Look_at_the_handle_!! "Look at the handle !!"

Check out the size of my executable. 

No, your eyes aren't deceiving you. 

This Image Converter/Viewer comes in at a low 6508 bytes long!!!
