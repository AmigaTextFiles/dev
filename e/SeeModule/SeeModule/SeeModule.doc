                             --------------
    General:
    -------
    This program is an offshoot of "Mods2Guide" V2.  It is based on a
    suggestion made to me by Barry Wills.

    Mods2Guide creates an AmigaGuide database containing the expanded
    ASCII contents of the Amiga E Modules directory, for easy reference,
    plus an alphabetical index of all of the module names, for those who
    prefer that style of reference.  The size of these two files, for the
    standard Modules directory that comes with the Amiga E V3.2a
    distribution package, is almost 400K.  As more modules are created,
    I expect this size will only increase.

    SeeModule takes a different approach - you can think of it as a GUI
    for "ShowModule".  This program also creates an AmigaGuide database
    (called "SeeModule.guide") which contains the names of all of the
    Amiga E modules.  Visually, it is almost identical to Mods2Guide.
    The difference is that the modules have NOT been pre-expanded.


    Requirements:
    ------------
    *  "Emodules:" must be assigned to the directory containing the modules.
    *  Kickstart 37 (Workbench 2.04) or later.


    Limitations:
    -----------
    The program will exit gracefully if:
    *  There are directories nested inside of directories.
    *  There are more than 98 directories.
    *  There are more than 75 files in any directory (except the
         root directory).

    If for any reason Wouter should change the output format of his
    ShowModule program, this version of SeeModule will probably no longer
    function properly.


    Usage:
    -----
    So how do I use this thing, you ask?

    1.  Run the SeeModule program.  Options are itemized below.
        The file "SeeModule.guide" will be created in RAM:

    2.  Load SeeModule.guide into AmigaGuide.  Find the module you want
        to examine.

    3.  Click on the name of the module.  There will be little or no
        indication that anything has happened (perhaps a flicker of
        disk activity), but the module will be expanded to a user-
        definable file.

    4.  Run your favorite text reader, and examine the module.

    The program may be run from a Shell or Workbench.
    Just double-click the icon, but then you are stuck with the defaults -
    (Hey, I'm just learning!), or in a Shell enter "SeeModule".
    "SeeModule INFO" gives a brief description of the command template.
    Command line arguments are optional - all options have defaults.

    <Control - C> will halt the program at any time.


    Command Line Template:
    ---------------------
    The command line template of SeeModule V2.1 is as follows:

             INFO/S, I=INDEX/S, R=REPLACE/S, S=SMDIR/K,
             D=DEST/S, H=HEIGHT/N, ND/N, NF/N, NR/N


    Argument Description:
    --------------------
      INFO     Displays some basic information.
      INDEX    Show module names alphabetically.  Default is by directory.
      REPLACE  Replace the module in the dest. file with the new module.
               Default is to append the new module.  Without REPLACE, the
               destination file will grow larger, as new modules are added.
      SMDIR    The path to the directory containing ShowModule.  The default
               is that ShowModule is already in your search path.  If used,
               the path must end in a ":" or a "/".
      DEST     Name of the destination file to contain the expanded modules.
               Default is "RAM:CurrentModules.txt".
               EG.  SeeModule DEST=RAD:MyModules
      HEIGHT   The height (in rows) of the AmigaGuide file.
               The default is 16, which nicely fills a 200 pixel high window.
               A height of 5 will be used if a number < 5 is entered.

    If the "INDEX" argument is used, the modules are always listed one to a
    line.  Otherwise, the following three arguments can also be used:

      ND       Number of directory names placed on 1 line.  These are the
               names in the main (Contents) window.  The default is 4.
      NF       Number of filenames placed on 1 line.  These are the filenames
               shown when you click on a directory name.  The default is 2.
      NR       Number of root-filenames placed on 1 line.  The default is 3.


    Example:
    -------
    1> Run SeeModule REPLACE  SMDIR=DH0:AmigaE/Bin/  NR=2   


    Advantages/Disadvantages:
    ------------------------
    The advantages of SeeModule over Mods2Guide are:
    
    1.  You do not have to keep files occupying 400K+ on your harddrive.
        The current size of "SeeModule.guide" (for V3.2a) is <30K.
    
    2.  The AmigaGuide database will be created with very little free RAM
        required.  Mods2Guide V2.1 requires about 900K of free RAM to
        expand the V3.2a standard modules.

    The primary disadvantage is that it is not as convenient, due to the
    two-step approach (expand with SeeModule.guide, read with your text
    reader).  This disadvantage can be minimized by using the macro feature
    available with most text editors.  In my case, I made a small ARexx
    macro, something like:

             /*  SeeModule.edge  */

           ADDRESS COMMAND
           'AmigaGuide RAD:SeeModule.guide'
           'TextReader RAM:CurrentModules.txt'

    Change the names of the files and paths to suit your own situation.

    This macro may now be bound to a keyboard combination, for example,
    <Alternate - S> (for SeeModule), or <Alternate - M> (for Modules).
    Pressing this combination will now load the "SeeModule.guide" database
    into AmigaGuide.  Click on the module(s) you want expanded, then click
    on the AmigaGuide close gadget.  The expanded module(s) will then
    automatically be loaded into your text reader for examination.
