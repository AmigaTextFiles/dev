This program is FreeWare - We all know what this means, don't we?

DISCLAIMER...
I can not be held responsible for any damage caused by the use
or misuse of this program.

REQUIREMENT...

An Amiga
KS V37+
The small program 'ShowModule'

USAGE...

ShowModuleGUI MODULE/A SCREEN/K BINPATH/K MODPATH/K MATCH/K

MODULE - the module you want to show (with or without .m)
SCREEN - name of the screen to open window on (default = Workbench)
BINPATH - path to showmodule program, end with / or : (default = E:bin/)
MODPATH - path to the modules, end with / or : (default = Emodules:)
MATCH - case sensitive search string (no wildcard search yet)

BUGS...

*Doesn't return all memory - you'll lose a small amount every time.
 Actually, it's showmodule stealing the mem.

CONTACT THE AUTOR...

Reach me at hma@algonet.se for bugs or if you like to say something nice
Someone who knows the format of a module, AUTODOCS maybe?
