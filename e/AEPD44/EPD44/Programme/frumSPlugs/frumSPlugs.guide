@node intro "frumSPlugs - Introduction"

@{b}@{u}Introduction@{uu}@{ub}

  Welcome to frumSPlugs!  You can now add even more power to Wouter van Oortmerssen's famous E language.  If you use the EasyGUI interface to design your GUI's, then this is for you.

@{b}@{u}What is it?@{uu}@{ub}

  frumSPlugs is a collection of Plugins for the EasyGUI environment.  They are all simple to implement and can make powerful additions to your GUI's.  Here's what's in the package:

  - BitMapPlugin:      Inserts a bitmap structure anywhere in the GUI.
  - BackDropPlugin:    Puts a bitmap in the background of the GUI.
  - BusyBoxPlugin:     Puts a busy waiting box with a little scroll routine anywhere in
                       the GUI.
  - GaugePlugin:       Creates a gauge with a bevel box of your choosing.
                       The range can be set - does not have to be 0 to 100.
                       The colours can also be set - is not restricted to the
                       regular fill and background pens.
  - ImagePlugin:       Puts a simple intuition image in the gui.  Non resizable.
  - ImageButtonPlugin: Puts a simple intuition image into the gui as a boolean
                       gadget.

  Buy the way, if you use frumSPlugs in your application, please @{"tell me" link lense} and put me in your greetings.

@node req "frumSPlugs - Requirements"

@{b}@{u}Requirements@{uu}@{ub}

  - Version 3.2e of Amiga E & Version 3.2e of EasyGUI (for PLUGIN support)
  - OS2.04+
  - For certain plugins, knowledge of bitmaps in the graphics.library.

@endnode


@node use "frumSPlugs - Usage"

@{b}@{u}Usage@{uu}@{ub}

  All plugins are interfaced in the same way:

    @{fg shine}[PLUGIN,{plugaction},NEW mp.myplugin()]@{fg text}

  In the case of @{i}my @{ui}plugins, there are additional arguments to the constructor:

  @{"BitMapPlugin     " link bitmapplugin}
  @{"BackDropPlugin   " link backdropplugin}
  @{"BusyBoxPlugin    " link busyboxplugin}
  @{"GaugePlugin      " link gaugeplugin}
  @{"ImagePlugin      " link imageplugin}
  @{"ImageButtonPlugin" link imagebuttonplugin}

  I suggest playing around with the @{"examples" link examples} and trying out different backdrops with the iff loader.  (BTW, this program doesn't seem to work correctly with the backdrops that come with MagicWB.  If you load them into Multiview and then re-save them, they work just fine.  I recommend trying this, as the MagicWB backdrops look @{i}really @{ui}nice in a window!  I believe the source of this problem is in the iff.library, not in my code.)

  Of course, all plugins contain the standard EasyGUI methods.

@node credits "frumSPlugs - Credits"

@{b}@{u}Credits@{uu}@{ub}

  All plugins in these modules were programmed by @{"Stephen Sinclair" link lense}, AKA frumS and Psyco.  Amiga E and EasyGUI were created by Wouter van Oortmerssen.  Idea for BusyBoxPlugin was from Busy.mcc, a custom class for MUI written by Klaus Melchior.

@node future "frumSPlugs - Future"

@{b}@{u}Future@{uu}@{ub}

  - Allow for BusyBox to scroll in the y-axis.
  - PopUp Gadgets for any requester, such as file or directory, font...
  - Interface for the ColorWheel.gadget and the GradientSlider.gadget and
    have them communicate.
  - Circular Knob gadget.
  - Level Meter gadget.  (Just a different kind of number display that
    involves a needle.)
  - A drawn scale on the gauge.
  - Implement the imagebutton's toggleselect feature.
  - Create a delay feature for the busybox.  It's slightly too fast when
    it's the only task doing anything.

  That's all I can think of.  If you get any even mildly good ideas, please don't hesitate to @{"tell me" link lense}!
  I'm sure I'll do my part and think of more ideas, and I hope that this package will continue to grow until by brain leaks.  (Which may not be too long from now...)
