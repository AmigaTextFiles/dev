The Amiga E modules that come with the xfd-package are not up to date and
also have unnecessary limitations. I converted the C include into a
E module. *All* restrictions of the old modules are removed, means all
structure names/structure members/library calls are axactly the same
as in the C includes.

To use xfd you have to include the modules 'xfdmaster' and
'libraries/xfdmaster' and switch preprocessing on (OPT PREPROCESS). Thats all.

Please note:

  The included xfdtextview are written by DII and comes with the xfd-package.
  I could neither find the email-address of DII nor a copyright notice. But I
  hope there are no problems with it.
  I have modified xfdtextview to work with the new xfdmaster-modules and
  optimized the source a bit. The limitations of xfdtextview are still the
  same. I have included original comments of DII below:

      XfdTextView doesn't currently work from the Workbench. It's Shell-only
      at the moment. It also doesn't display TABs properly, but it wasn't
      meant to be a serious application. I just thought you'd be interested
      in it.
