Quick Reference "Plugin_Bitmap.m"  © 1996 by Sebastian Hesselbarth


+--------- --- -- - -  Introduction

This Archive contains a PLUGIN written for the AmigaE-GUI-Designer
called EasyGUI ! It has been compiled with AmigaE-version 3.2e and I think
you need at least this version (> 3.2a) to use this module !
So if you don't have this version contact your national E distibutor to
buy/upgrade you AmigaE compiler. (Greetings to Joerg Wach ;) )

Right... I wrote this module to make it possible for EasyGUI programmers to
display simple bitmaps in their GUIs.
Therefore this module is able to display a bitmap in an EasyGUI-window and
you can scroll the bitmap using sliders and arrowbuttons in the case the
bitmap is larger than the display field !

Some routines (createbitmap(), min(), max(), rassize(), aso..) were taken from
Wouter's ScrollerWindow.e source. I hope he won't kill me :)

+--------- --- -- - -  Legal stuff

The programs and modules in this archive are
Copyright © 1996 by Sebastian Hesselbarth.

Further the Plugin_Bitmap module and the source are dedicated to
  the author of the AmigaE language Wouter van Oortmerssen ...

You are free to include the module in your programs, whether free-/pubilc-
share-/"whatever"-ware or commercial. 
The only thing that's a must is that the archive must be complete and must
contain all files unmodified.

I make no guaranties that this module is totally bug-free or work as expected.
This module is not really betatested so if you find any bug/error : contact me!

Finally I must say that it is your _own_ risk if you use this module and your
AMIGA® travels in to the deepest abysses of the Himalaya. (Greets 2 the GURU ;)
Or you harddisk reaches the NIRVANA while you use my program.
In this case I can only say : "sorry pals!". ;)

+--------- --- -- - -  Requirements

- GBytes of memory ... :)))) JOKE !!

* You need at least OS 2.0 (Upgrade pals !)
* For programing you need AmigaE v3.2a+
* For extremly large bitmaps you _really need_ GBytes of memory !
* Calc with (width * height * depth)/8 for memory usage !

+--------- --- -- - -  Usage

This module uses the standard PLUGIN routines (are there any other ? ;)
so you only ... have to look up in my example source or any other 
source that uses plugins ...

The easiest way is this :

DEF bm : PTR TO bitmap_plugin 

easygui('Title',
  ...
  [PLUGIN, 1, NEW bm.init (bitmap,width,height,depth)
  ...
  
Where "bm" is a pointer to "bitmap_plugin" :)
You must start "bm" with the "init" procedure ... the arguments are :

bitmap = PTR TO a memory area that contains a bitmap structure
width  = The width of "bitmap"
height = ... ^^^
depth  = ... ^^^

It's so simple isn't it ? Anyway you have problems with it contact me ...
