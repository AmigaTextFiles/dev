I am in the process of thinking up a system for the design of control

It should eventually be *completely * interactive, with windows for
Nyquist, Bode, etc plots,  zooms, etc.

I *do not* fancy writing a parser for input in E (algebraic equations)

Unless there is a yaccE! :), and so I may use C to produce an intermediate
format of data, or attempt to use AreXX! :#


I shall be using a lot of math-sy stuff, so shall be relying on Barry's

Heh-heh.  Good stuff!  Actually, it appears to me as if EC "links" the stuff in
the modules only if they're referenced, so there's no squandering of resources
going on.  Reason I say this is because when you declare a func or a variable
or a constant that is not used, EC complains, but if you include modules that
declare constants and don't reference most of them (which is usually the case),
EC doesn't care enough to complain.

Wouter, is this correct?  If so, will user modules in v2.5 be treated in the 
same manner?  It sure would be nice. :)


Later.

Agreed.  That was one of the things I liked about AMOS, you could have all

It may not be elegant but it's a feature sure to make it very popular.

Subject: RE: EHS

First, big apologies to Barry Wills for not putting his name in the
documentation for EHS.  Actually, I just figured everyone knew him so
well he needed no introduction (yeah, right).  Now, Barry has some
helpful suggestions for using EHS with EPP... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject:  "BUG REPORTS, COMMENTS, SUGGESTIONS, FLAMES" for:

The E HEADERS System  (Revision 1.00)

[Some general comments which may be of public interest:]
>    The drawbacks are minimal, but there.  The E HEADERS System can slow down

Try using a script like this:

  .key file
  .bra [
  .ket ]
  Echo "Preprocessing..."
  EPP -b10000 -s -t [file] [file]i
  If WARN
    Echo "Quitting after errors."
  Else
    Echo "Compiling..."
    EC [file]
    Echo "Done."
  EndIf

This will properly check for the success of EPP.  An unfriendly thing about EPP
is that if a pmodule is not found you will only get the message 'Error opening
input file.' This and other messages will be more friendly in a possible future
release.

>compilation process.  Of course, for subsequent compiles you can always work
>on the outputted EPP source rather than the pre-EPP file, eliminating the

Blerk! (to paraphrase an acquaintence of mine :-)  This defeats the purpose of
EPP:  modularity and reduction of module size.

[note: I don't mean to defeat the purpose of EPP, of course, but I
guess I am arrogant enough to think some people may want to use EPP
for only EHS]

>overhead of multiple invocations of EPP.  Also, The E HEADERS System makes a

Warning: if you redirect the output of EPP, you won't see *any* error messages.
This will change in a possible future release. If you use the script above, you
will at least get an indication that there was an error.  Use the switches "-s"
and "-t" instead.  Or in your shell-startup execute the command:

  Alias epp "epp -s -t"

-s  makes EPP run silently
-t  makes EPP use Turbo mode on the entire project

[Excellent suggestion.]

>    OPT TURBO is not included in The E HEADER System files.  They are so short
>performance should not be affected.   OPT TURBO should be in the next

OPT TURBO would not matter in these since there are no PROCs, so don't waste
your effort.

[Wasn't sure if this would make a difference.]

Later.

D.L,
 
I am currently writing just such a thing in E for a project that I am
working on.  It includes all of the basic features, support for
variables, a modular function system and named, user defined
equations.  If this sounds interesting to you, I would be happy to
provide you with the source for it when I am done (by the end of
August) for you to use.  Just let me know.

The only thing contained in the E module files are LVOs,
constants and structures.

Compare this to a C or Pascal system, where there are
actual procedures and functions in the unit/include files.
If a C compiler was to compile the entire include file,
that would result in a waste of space.

But, if you think about it, there is no way that Amiga E
could have the same problem because it does not use the
code stubs like C or Pascal.

Hope I'm right on this :-)

Heh-heh.  Good stuff!  Actually, it appears to me as if EC "links" the stuff in
the modules only if they're referenced, so there's no squandering of resources
going on.  Reason I say this is because when you declare a func or a variable
or a constant that is not used, EC complains, but if you include modules that
declare constants and don't reference most of them (which is usually the case),
EC doesn't care enough to complain.

Wouter, is this correct?  If so, will user modules in v2.5 be treated in the 
same manner?  It sure would be nice. :)


Later.

Agreed.  That was one of the things I liked about AMOS, you could have all
your bank files compiled into the final executable.  Keeps things nice 'n
simple 'n together (maybe not for the programmer of the language tho ;-)

It may not be elegant but it's a feature sure to make it very popular.

Personally, I'd prefer elegance over that bank method any day.

Have fun

Subject: Multi-Dimensional Arrays in E

After much head-banging it's finally arrived!  In here are:  EPP module,
example programs (ooooh!), documentation (ahhhh!)  I did test these routines, so
I *think* they should work in all cases unless you do something really
outlandish, like try to assign something to address 4.  It's mildly friendly and
fool-proof, but you can still shoot yourself in the foot (the danger, the
adrenaline! 8-)  Really, try these routines out and tell me how they work.  I
have released them to the public (go free, Free, FREE...) so I don't claim any
rights to maintaining them, but I would like to hear if they are working okay
for you.  If anyone makes a change to the EPP module I'd appreciate it if he/she
posts the changes to the list (or send me a private copy) simply because I'm
always interested in code and new ideas.

Have fun.  Enjoy.  Live long...and prosper. }-|

Subject: multi-dim arrays (note)

Hmmmmm, seems my uuencoder is doing some unexpected things.  On my unix machine
I had to create the directory dh0:jr-comm/uloads in order to uudecode the
multi-dimensional arrays distribution.  For those who don't have a dh0: you can
probably assign this to a drive or directory temporarily and then create the
directories under it.  I don't know if this is necessary on the Amiga, but I
had to force it in this fashion on a Sun.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Email
me if you want me to rxmt a better package.  Later.  -- Barry

Subject: re: ReadArgs()

Hi, Dan.  Sorry about the slow reply.

In response to your message titled "ReadArgs():"

>  Ok, my question is about the readargs.e example.  Is it correct, and if

Yes, it does work.  Your problem lies in the obscurity of the command template,
a feature of the Amiga which is by no means friendly.  Here is a blow-by-blow:

/* Use readargs() to get parameters instead of using the string 'arg'.
   This is more convenient if more than one arg is needed. Uses kick 2.0 */

OPT OSVERSION=37
/*-- You must be using KS 2,0+ --*/

PROC main()
  DEF myargs:PTR TO LONG,rdargs
/*-- PTR TO LONG is used to access an array of LONG, also know in E as a   --*/
/*-- List.  rdargs is a generic pointer which holds an address returned    --*/
/*-- by ReadArgs(), the purpose of which I am unsure except that it        --*/
/*-- indicates success.  Anyone else care to comment?                      --*/

  myargs:=[0,0,0]
/*-- One way (the easiest) of allocating and initializing a List variable. --*/
/*-- This is where ReadArgs() is going to put the command-line args for    --*/
/*-- you to get as you please.                                             --*/

  IF rdargs:=ReadArgs('UNIT/N,DISK/A,NEW/S',myargs,NIL)
/*-- Attempt to get the command-line args in the format specified by the
/*-- template string.  The tags after each arg's name tells you what kind
/*-- arg it is and how/when it must be used:  
/*--   /N means a number is expected; 
/*--   /A means arg must always be provided;
/*--   /K means the keyword must be given if the argument is provided, 
/*--      e.g., if DISK/A were changed to DISK/A/K then you would need to
/*--      enter "DISK somestring" on the command-line;
/*--   /S means arg is a switch; this is probably the arg that was giving
/*--      you the problem; here you must type the arg name to set the 
/*--      switch to TRUE or omit it to set the switch to FALSE;
/*--   /M means multiple arguments are accepted; these must always precede 
/*--      all other args; I'm not sure if having two multiple-args 
/*--      parameters in a command-line is legal or practical;
/*--   =  allows for synonyms/abbreviations to be used, e.g., replacing
/*--      NEW/S with NEW=N/S would allow you to use N on the command-
/*--      line in place of keyword NEW. 
/*-- So the following usages are valid for this program:
/*--   readargs 1 mydisk new; "new" is a switch, ON here
/*--   readargs 0 mydisk    ;  ....              OFF here
    WriteF('UNIT=\d\n',Long(myargs[0]))      /* integer */
    WriteF('DISK=\s\n',myargs[1])            /* string */
    WriteF('NEW=\d\n',myargs[2])             /* boolean */
    FreeArgs(rdargs)
/*-- Evidently ReadArgs() does some things we need to clean up. --*/
  ELSE
    WriteF('Bad Args!\n')
  ENDIF
ENDPROC

Hope this helped to clear some things up.

Later.
-- Barry

All you need to do is edit the uuencoded file.  At the BEGIN line,
remove all the superflous path information.  Worked for me!

According to the AmigaDOS manual, the rdargs structure returned by
ReadArgs() 'serves as an "anchor" to allow FreeArgs() to free the
associated memory.'  It goes on further to say that 'You can also pass
in a struct RDArgs to control the operation of ReadArgs()...This mode
of action allows you to provide different sources for the arguments,
thus providing your own string buffer space for temporary storage, and
extended help text.'  (All text Copyright 1991 by Commodore Capital,

Subject: re: ReadArgs()

In response to my own message titled "ReadArgs():"

  myargs:=[0,0,0]

The RKRM says that ReadArgs() requires an array of long integers, which is
compatible with a List variable for this purpose.

Two more argument tags listed in the RKRM (not listed in the AmigaDOS manual)
are:

    /T which acts as a switch, but the value is toggled .vs. set;
    /F which treats the remainder of the line as a single arg;

I'm not sure how either of these could be useful.

    WriteF('UNIT=\d\n',Long(myargs[0]))      /* integer */

You might be wondering what this strange dereferencing is.  RKRM states that
numeric arguments are returned as a pointer to long.  So myargs[0] is an
address, and to get the long integer at address you need to use the function
call Long(myargs[0]);

    FreeArgs(rdargs)

To Chad:  I know that this frees the anchor, but why would one need to keep an
anchor?  Are there some other functions we can use with this to make life
easier for us?

Later.

Is the self-modifying code really necessary? I'd actually rather sacrifice a
couple of bytes for code that isn't self-modifying, thus leaving me with a
considerably greater peace of mind - I'm a (un)happy owner of an A1200, and
I've had many a program crashing down on me because of either hardware
hitting or ignoring the cache feature of the 020. :-(

I agree, esp. as the AmigaDOS file hunk format lets you specify which hunks
should go where in memory -- i.e. the same procedure Wouter described above,
but without the extra fuss of opening files, reading them into the
appropriate memory type and then closing them.

I've nearly finished my example code of multiple windows
from one task.

The code uses an exec list to track the windows, which
makes it easy to activate the next window in sequence, and
add and remove windows from the list at will.

Just one last bug to iron out and then I'll mail it, so
stay tuned :-)

I also have an AGA colour cube program with some very
dodgy mouse handling techniques, but it shows off HAM8 so
I'll probably mail it unchanged.

Both programs should make it to the list tomorrow morning

I just came across a front-end program for E. It looks damn good, but haven't
really USED it as I'm not doind any programming. It's got a
2.0/GadTools/ReqTools thing going, with buttons to call your editor, to
compile, to execute what you're working on, and an output window.

Anyway, let the E-Newsletter folks know I have it in case they want me to mail
it to them (I don't know the address to do it myself), unless you know they
already want it. Also, if you want it, let me know. I'll UUencode it for ya.

I'll be sure to keep everyone updated.  I think I'll start on the NVir project

P.S. - never accept a job that isn't well-specified.

  it always hung because of my array demands.  I should be able to move along

Self-modifying code is not nearly as bad as you make it
sound. The code does modify itself, but does not modify
the source, which is what "self-modifying" means in terms
of BASIC or other interpreted languages.

Also, self-modifying tends to imply that the instructions
themselves are changed, which they are not. The changes
only affect areas of code used specifically for holding
data.

Try listing your c directory. It is likely that any
programs which do not have the "p" flag set for pure code
are "self-modifying" as you call them.

Code which behaves in this manner is the norm, rather than

Subject: Self-modifying code

[In reply to a message from Dave Higginson titled "Re: The future of E":]

Dave, I recall Wouter replying to the original message of this thread, and he
said that EC does not self-modify, nor do any of the executables produced by
EC.  They should be pure.

Additionally, I thought that "self-modifying" referred specifically to those
programs that modify their own instructions as a means to optimize for speed
or whatever.

When might we expect a new release of 'E'?
About how far down the road is the OOP sections?

Subject: GAME

Hello , this is my first post . I have just started to program the Amiga
and hope to be able to use E . It seems to be very good. Anyway for my
first project I want to make some sort of graphical adventure game . If
anyone has any suggestions on things I could do please give me some.
Here are some questions I have to start off with  :

1)Is is possible for me to use IFF format graphic files in E ?

2)Does anyone have any pseudo code(or even real) for an adventure game
type format?

3)lastly what kind of themes would you all out there like to see in an
adventure game written in E ?

If anyone can help please reach me at:
olso0001@student.tc.umn.edu

P.S. Im sitting here in Minnesota , and it is as boring as Little House on
the Praire . I neeeeeed projects to keep me busy . So please help.

Subject: AGACC

Hello all.

I've *finally* managed to get xmh to accept this uuencoded
file by renaming it to a number, placing it in the mail
directory and selecting "Use as composition". If anybody
knows an easier way, please mail me.

Anyway, this file contains the E source code file agacc.e.
When you compile and run it, the program opens a HAM8
screen and displays what is commonly known as a colour
cube. You can click on any part of the cube to change the
colour.

Hmmm... it's quite hard to explain, so just run the
program to experiment. In any case, it looks nice (main
purchasing motive for Windoze ;^)
 
I'd better warn you that this program uses the Mouse()
function to test for clicks, which as we all know is
strictly forbidden and you should use IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS.
So, only use this program for HAM8 information.

You will need AGA or the program will fail.

Dave.

PS If you want detailed information on the workings of the
program, mail me. Apologies in advance for writing sloppy,
undocumented code.

Subject: What I'm working on.  MuX MuSiC DiSk...

Hi y'all.

I have started working on a music disk (well, a while ago)...

Ok this is what I need help on...

Loading IFF images, any format, anyrez.

A Scrolly routine for the bottom of the screen.

This is how I have it set up...  4 screens: 3 you can see, that are overlapping
each other, and one in the back, for the buffer.  I want to load a pic to each.

This is how the screns go: one 320 x 47 5 bitplanes for the logo, then one in
the middle (the interface) 320 x 186.  Then one at the bottom (the scroller)
320 x 21.  All this in PAL ofcoz.

All I really need is the pic loader and scrolly routine.  I expect the full
product to be atleast 1 or 2 full disks, 2.0+ only.

What do you think?

Subject: Users Guide ?

okay, plowing through all the requests posted here, I have a small
suggestion. How about an 'E' user users Guide ?
a 'reference.doc' type text, but moreexamples of reallife
situations. EG, small progs that make the use of a feature CLEAR!

The reference.doc is good, but I think it's not the best thing to
use to get to know surtain features (EG iff handling, Devices etc)

So, if you have any small'n usefull example progs, or you have
some info you think is usefull to others (read: people who have only
a mild history of programming) then send them to me, and I'll
try to compile a nice readble doc!

(Grammer errors excluded, I'm only dutch :) )

I think we'd all like to see an integrated E editor/compiler(/debugger?)...
If anyone(Wouter?) thinks it's worthwhile writing this, I sure would like to
be part of it. I think it would be an exciting project which most certainly
will help spreading E around the world (and perhaps to other systems, which
it definitely deserves!).

     Being a kind and gentle soul, I succumb to C='s recommendations of not
     hitting the hardware directly. Instead, try opening the gameport.device
     using the usual OpenDevice routine.

[terrible hardware-hitting deleted :-O ]

Just my opinion. And no, I'm not trying to start a flame war about hardware-
hitting.

Well, both C and E are powerful in their aspects of using the OS routines,
that aside they both have their advantages, although E is closing in on C in
a few topics. E also has some very rare features for a compiled language,
like quoted expressions(does it make sense?), automatic linked lists and so
on, while it lacks some of the almost obvious must-haves of C, which I'm told
will largely be fixed in the next release (2.3?) of the compiler, and add
object-orientation to E (being a C++ programmer, I'm beginning to find E
close to the ideal language :-)!

Also, E has some window,screen and drawing functions that are not part of the
OS which make it very easy to open a screen and/or a window and draw all you
like.

Besides that, E allows inline assembly just about anywhere in your code, if
you feel like doing something fancy one fine day.

Phew! If it doesn't make much sense, it's because I just did my fifth exam in
financial analysis, which I hold for highly unlikely that I passed.

                 ^
                 The list server sends all incoming mail to everyone on the
                 list, right? So it's really overkill, as I will get one mail
                 directly delivered to me, and then later on, another
                 identical from the list server! Am I right?

What I'm trying to say is that it's basically a question of netiquette; don't
use more bandwidth than is necessary. And no, I'm not flaming anyone, but I
just assumed I was the only one having noticed this. Comments welcome.

Haven't seen one of these in over a week, so I thought I'd stir it up :-)  Some
of these have already been wished for, but I'm not trying to be original, more
like adding to the consensus.  But then, you know what my father used to say
about wishes... :-)

1.  Quoted expressions that take parameters.  Even a quoted expression that 
takes 1 parameter (which could be a list variable) would be quite powerful.

2.  More flexible line continuation.

3.  A method (*any* method) for declaring static chip data. :-)

4.  Multi-dimensional arrays.

5.  More robust pointer dereferencing (e.g., cabinet.drawer.folder.item).

6.  Capability of having pointer types other than LONG in object definitions:
    OBJECT a
      x : PTR TO xx
      y : PTR TO yy
      z : PTR TO zz
    ENDOBJECT
    I guess that kinda fits in with #5.

Can't think of any others right now.  Everything else I wanted we're getting,
and then some.  If I don't get these I'll still be a happy camper.  (But I've 
been pushing hard for #3! :-)

Hey, Fred Fish disks 741 and 742 (I think its them) have all of the
examples from Commodore's books in C. I don't know if you know C at
all but it could give at least an idea of what to do and it wont cost
any more than whatever it takes to get the two disks.
 
If you have any specific kinds of examples in mind, post them here
and I or someone else wiil do there best to help out.

Haven't you seen a demo before?  If not you're missing out on a lot.  I just

Well anyways, all a scroller is a typically text being scrolled at the bottom
screen.  Sort of like what they on TV for weather watches.  Scrollers in Demos
are used to type info, greetz and other nonsence...

Subject: self modifying code etc.

hello all,
 
recently there have been some confusing mails about self modifying
code, purity and such so I thought I'd clear some things up:
 
- Selfmodifying code is when code is manipulated or generated,
  and subsequently executed. The main problem with this is that
  some advanced processors will execute the old code in cache,
  since they have no reason to assume the code changed. Self
  modifying code is simply "NOT DONE" on the amiga, and EC, and
  also any other compiler I know, do NOT generate such code.
  You can safely modify code when:
  - you do not wish to directly execute it, but do something
    else with (like saving to disk, as EC does)
  - you call exec's functions to flush the cache between
    the manipulation and the execution of the code.
  Modifying code when you're programming in a higher-level
  language like E doesn't make sense anyway.
- A pure executable is an executable that does not modify
  the data embedded in the executable. Some C compilers
  traditionally store their global variables as static data
  in the executable, and are thus not pure. With E, this is
  somewhat easier, as variables are stored on the stack
  (or in registers), so executables generated by E are mostly
  pure, the only constructions that might make an E-exe
  unpure are lists (like [1,2,3]), that are modified after
  the start of the program.
  keep in mind: modifying static data within an executable
  is a legal practise, but makes executables unpure. Unpurity
  does _not_ entail self modifying code.

yes, unfortunately this is a bug/misbehaviour in v2.1b. all "F" formatting
functions share the same data area for there temporal results, since I never
figured that they could be used together, but you demonstrated differently.
 
the only thing you can do for now is place the float2string call outof
the WriteF() call, I hope to have this fixed in the next release.

some part (object inheritence) is already implemented in the current

When I'm a bit nearer to v2.5, I'll re-post some infos on what's

it's possible, but it requires some tricky E code that basically boils
down to saving and restoring the global variables pointer (A4). I wouldn't
advice to do this at home :-)
v2.5 has a function that allows you to start PROCs as tasks.

a debugger will be available anyway soon, the only thing missing would
be an editor. the problem is that this would have to be a _really_
good one, since it's unlikely anyone used to Ced or TurboText would want
to give up his/her own editor for the integrated environment if it were
worse.

my guess is that there is a massive amount of good E sources out there,
only we haven't gathered them all together. It would be toomuch to send them
all to the list anyway.
The best would probably be if someone would gather everybodys readable
E sources, pack them all together in archives of, say, 100k, put a contents/info
file with it, and up them as e_pd_sources_xxx.lha to aminet (xxx=[001,002,...]),
or send them to fred fish, for Daniel and all others to profit from. maybe
someone with a well-founded E-knowledge, so he/she can check the sources for
good programming techniques (after all, we want to _learn_ from it, right? :-).
suggestions/comments anybody?

    I AM WORKING ON ONE! It's called "(E)(D)evelopment(S)ystem" and is vewy
buggy right now! Actually, I am looking for people to help me in getting a
text ed built for inclusion into (E)(D)(S) so I don't have to.

    If you're interested E-Mail me directly and I'll let you in on the
project.  I Hadn't thought about a source level debugger, but that would be
very cool to implement! Tell me what you're good at.

Subject: OpenWindows()

Hi,

I am working on a CSD (Control system design) project, and have run into
a problem opening multiple windows. Can someone post some example
source, say for opening aa few windows, on which I can do some line drawing
etc..

And when that is done, how can you specify which window you want to draw in?

Subject: Pure code.

In reply to some remarks last week about EC and the
generation of pure code. The following program is a
demonstration that (in some situations at least), non-pure
code is generated by the E compiler.

-----8<-----8<-----
PROC main()
  DEF p:PTR TO LONG,c
  p:=[0]
  WriteF('p=\z\h[8]\n',p[0])
  c:=Inp(stdout)
  p[0]:=$12345678
  WriteF('p=\z\h[8]\n',p[0])
  c:=Inp(stdout)
  p[0]:=$87654321
  WriteF('p=\z\h[8]\n',p[0])
  c:=Inp(stdout)
ENDPROC
-----8<-----8<-----

Compile the program, and make it resident by typing:

PROTECT puretest +p
RESIDENT puretest
DELETE puretest

Now type:

puretest

You should see that the first WriteF returns 00000000, as
expected. Press RETURN twice, and you get 12345678 and
87654321.

Now try running the program again. This time 00000000 does
not appear because the statements in the program changed
it the first time the program was run. The first number to
appear is 87654321.

This means that the code is not re-executable, i.e.
subsequent executions do not produce the same result.

You can also show that the code is not re-entrant by
running the code (with small alterations) from two shells.

So, modifying lists produces non-pure code. As strings are
handled similarly, I would think that the same problem
exists there (though I haven't tried this). I have found
that variables are always local to the task and are
initialised correctly.

I'm thinking about producing a set of guidelines showing
how to get E to produce pure code, whaddya think?

Subject: More HAM code

Hi all.

Here's a couple more programs showing off the Amiga's HAM
mode. The first is called ham6demo.e, which opens a low
resolution screen and draws a pretty pattern which
contains all 4096 displayable colours.

The second is called ham8demo.e (no prizes for guessing
what this does). Because there are 262,144 possible
colours, ham8demo requires a hires, laced screen. Note
that the size of the entire ham6demo fits into one of the
small boxes on the ham8demo! (Also, you need AGA, of
course :-)

BTW, this code is much nicer than the last HAM stuff I
posted because it uses GetMsg() and WaitPort().

Dave :-)

P.S. I can't track down this !!@#$! bug in my
multi-windows code. Hope to have it fixed soon though.

Here is one suggestion (I haven't been able to check it out cause my 1200's
transformer just blew, so I'm not quite sure about the actual syntax):

[I'll omit the initial code]

PROC Main()
  DEF w1,w2 : PTR TO window,
      rp1,rp2 : PTR TO rport /* Or whatever */


  w1 = OpenWindowTags( <your tags> ) /* Assuming you're running 2.0+ */
  w2 = OpenWindowTags(   ....      )

  /* Don't forget to check for opening errors! */

  rp1 = window1.rport
  rp2 = window1.rport
  Move( rp1, 30, 30); /* I'm not even sure about the order of arguments! */
  Draw( rp1, 50, 50);
  . /* similar for rp2 */
  .
  .
  CloseWindow(w2);
  CloseWindow(w1);
ENDPROC

>
> And when that is done, how can you specify which window you want to draw in?

As above, get hold of the rastport address and just send it along with the
other arguments to the drawing routines -- I think it's because you're using
E's built-in drawing routines you can't choose your own window.

Hope this helped out somewhat.

I agree ... this would give a sort of DEF FN type functionality, but with
compiled code.

I have often thought that any left bracket should be an indication that the
line continues. I'm unhappy when my call to CreateMenusA looks jaggy because
there's no way of splitting the line until after the first menu definition (a
very small point :-)

If E recognised a line continuation when there are not enough close brackets,
any statement could be continued over several lines simply by placing it in
parentheses.

Hmmm... I think a nice command line option to "include" files for chip data
would be nicer - it would save having all those unsightly hexadecimal bits in
your source code. Or, you could have an include command, like 
INCLUDE p,"graphics:mypic.iff". This would compile the program with the
picture and place a pointer to the data in p. Perhaps we need an E Post
Processor to handle this sort of stuff.

Would be nicer than trying to calculate the offset yourself.

Yes please. I'm fed up with having to shift pointers between variables.
Sometimes it's easier to use the Long() function with an actual number added
on, like Long(pointer+34). This defeats the whole point of the modules.

>     ENDOBJECT

Also being able to put a substructure into a new object would be nice. For
example, GadTools puts the userdata field into a longword directly after the
menuitem structure. It would be much easier to be able to do this:

OBJECT gadmenuitem
        mi: menuitem
  userdata: LONG
ENDOBJECT

Currently I use Long(item+34) (34 being the size of a menuitem structure).

Using a substructure would also make exec lists and nodes a hell of a lot
easier to work with.

You can use E's built-in functions with multiple windows
... I think. All you need to do is set the variable
stdrast to the rastport of the window you wish to draw in,
like so:

stdrast:=window1.rport

I *think* this will work -- you'll have to try it out :-)

Subject: ADMIN: Mailing list delays...


As I'm sure you've all noticed, bkhouse was down from Monday until 
Wednesday night of this week due to a change of address. I appologize
for not having given some notice, but in all the many things I was
doing in preparing for the move, such a notice slipped my mind.

Anyway, the list is back up and running and no mail was lost (only
delayed).

Thanks for your understanding...

Norm.

Is it not possible to have an Arexx interface to texteditors, to provide
the integration (compilation/line highlighting/etc)

It will thus not be as highly integrated as hard-coded integration, but
should provide massive flexibility/modularity.

Subject: Re: iff.library



Hmmm.... can't seem to get the file to unpack properly. I
get iff.i and iff.h, and have found iff.library elsewhere
on my hard disk. I have managed to convert both the files
into Emodules (iff.i needs tweaking), but the archive did
not seem to contain any docs, just a changes file :-/

I have managed to get IfFL_OpenIFF and IfFL_CloseIFF to
work properly by handing them a pointer to a file opened
with Open(). Beyond that though, no luck :-(

If anybody has docs for iff.library, could they mail them
to the list? I'll archive iff.library and post it here
tomorrow. I think the problem was that the file was
truncated and had no 'end' line.

Has anybody got an iff library that works? That would
*definitely* be a good module to have.

Thi is indeed a (small) problem, but not that big.  There are several
ways to get around, but it costs more time/code to work around it.

This FOR/NEXT loop isn't that nice.  There are other function to do
the same, which are nicer (IMHO), like CopyMem() or CopyMemQuick().

Yes, i do. 

Here is the related part, which does works now (i'm sorry for the length):

/* Start of short example */
DEF busyPointer:PTR TO INT,my_mem=NIL

PROC setwaitpointer(ourwin:PTR TO window)

    busyPointer:=[$0000, $0000,     /* Reserved, must be NULL */
                  $0400, $07c0,
                  $0000, $07c0,
                  $0100, $0380,
                  $0000, $07e0,
                  $07c0, $1ff8,
                  $1ff0, $3fec,
                  $3ff8, $7fde,
                  $3ff8, $7fbe,
                  $7ffc, $ff7f,
                  $7efc, $ffff,
                  $7ffc, $ffff,
                  $3ff8, $7ffe,
                  $3ff8, $7ffe,
                  $1ff0, $3ffc,
                  $07c0, $1ff8,
                  $0000, $07e0,
                  $0000, $0000]:INT     /* Reserved, must be NULL */

    sizepoint:=72           /* Size of the busyPointer[] array */

    /* The Pointer-data must be in CHIP-memory */
    IF (my_mem:=AllocMem(sizepoint,MEMF_CHIP))

        /* Copy Pointer-data to allocated CHIP-memory!! */
        CopyMem(busyPointer,my_mem,sizepoint)

    /* SetPointer() : a function from the intuition.library */
    SetPointer(ourwin, my_mem, 16, 16, -6, 0)
ENDIF
/* End of short example */


Only problem is to determine the size of the data-array which
contains the date for the pointer in this example.  

Does Amiga E have a function to determine the size of such an Array
(i have now counted the amount manually)?  I have tried it with
SIZEOF, but only works for objects, and not for arrays?

> Hope this helps :-)

Thanks.

Ya, so far it's turning out well.  I have the graphics finished, my friend
Blaster has made one tune for it, and another friend (Rinaldo Petterino) is
making a nice 3-D Acme logo for it....

The only problem so far is the code.  I have a few problems to work out, but
it's nothing I can't handle, so I'll be finished soon (I hope hehehehe)

BTW, what music disks do you have?  I have a bunch and would like to expand my
collection?

Ok, cool.  I'll try it out, and if I can make it cooler, then I'll post the

Since I am new to programming , and Ive choosen E as the language to focus
on I was hoping other E people could help me answer some problems . If you
have any information concerning the following questions E-Mail me please.

1) How do you read in a string ?
 example : 
The computer prompts you with a question like
"Are you a boy or a girl?"
Then the user responds with his/her answer , and depending on the response
the computer would send you to the proper procedure.

2)How do you write graphics code ? (not using ploting and lines)
 example: Is there a way to transphorm iff files into E readable code .Or
do you have to figure out the data by hand . It would be nice if I could
draw my graphics in a Paint program then turn them into readable E code.

These may be easy questions , or the may be difficult . Either case anyone
who knows some answers please send me E-mail with some answers.

    Yes, it will work.  This will also work using intuition windows using
OpenWindowTags() and with window1 being a ptr to the window, and

                     ^^^^^^

What is this? Assembler-speak :-/ ? Sorry, no comprendez 68000 :-)

Anyway, to explain, this is the sort of thing I was thinking of:

-----8<-----8<-----
DEF p

INCLUDE p,INC_CHIP,'gfx:file.bitmap'

PROC main()
  WriteF('gfx are stored at address $\z\h[8].\n',p)
ENDPROC  
-----8<-----8<-----

When EC compiles this, it writes code to reserve some stack space
for the variable p. When it gets to the INCLUDE statement, it
allocates a new hunk of chip data big enough to store the file.
Then code is written to initialise p with the address of the chip
data.

This seems a good solution to the problem, because as source all
the data files are separate, but as an executable there is only
one file.

It seems feasible to me, but then I didn't write the compiler,
Wouter did. Perhaps he could tell us if this is viable?

Just an idea...

Dave :-)

Subject: Re: Crashing the compiler?


I've had EC crash on me on a number of occasions because it
ran out of memory. However, on close inspection, it seems
that I had 1.3megs free, but only 90k contiguous. How this
happens I don't know :-/.

I think maybe there is a bug in either WB3, or one of my
other programs running which causes this memory problem, but
I cannot track it down.

When something does crash, the error number refers to a
corrupt memory list, which leads me to think that there is a
rogue program on my system which is stomping on parts of
memory that it shouldn't.

I'm not blaming EC, it has happened when EC was not running.

Anybody else had this problem? I have a 1200 w/ HD, no other
peripherals.

I have never had EC crash on me, and I've certainly done some risky things.
Usually it is the code that I tell EC to compile that does the damage :-)  I've
seen some wierd things happen, like I'd test-run my project and it would run
perfectly and quit without any unusual indications; then I'd take a directory
listing of RAM: (or something of that nature) and crash my system.  Since I've
always been able to eliminate those problems I've never had reason to suspect
EC (which is more than can be said for some commercial compilers.)

Subject: UUDECODE

I have written both UUENCODE and UUDECODE utilities in E and they seem to
work correctly, but something is puzzling me. There seems to be an extra
character in each logical record (i.e. text line) of a UUENCODEd file. In
one instance I finally figured out that the extra character which is the
last character of each logical "record" is a crc-type character, i.e. it
is the encoded value of the sum of the original characters modulo 63. Once
I figured that out, I added logic to my UUENCODE utility to calculate it and
append the resulting character to the end of each logical record. What is
troubling me is that apparently not all UUENCODED files seem to follow the
same rules for calculating this character even though the character itself
always seems to be present. The sources I have available don't even check
for the presence of the character. Can anyone advise me on this matter, or
should I just ignore the presence of this character?

Subject: Re: MUI

    Here is the message Stefan Stuntz wrote to me regarding the making of E
modules for MUI (Get MUI quick...it is awesome!) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi!

Most of the mui.h header file is generated automatically (from line 613 on).
If you could tell me, how e.g. the "Window.mui" section looks in E, i can
eaily genarate E header files too. If E has a preprocessors, it would
be nice to have the section upto line 613 translated too :-)

Bye, Stefan

============================================================================
                                                                            
    Anybody got any clues? Wouter? Someone willing to make the modules? This
is sooooooo much bigger/better/more useful than XPK or the IFF library, 
it isn't even funny!

Don't have those... I have some like Danse Diverse, Numberic Vol. III,

and a bunch of other that I can't remember off-hand..  I also have about 200

Ya, I use that too, I have 47 disks of powerpacked mods (I packed them with
PowerPackerProf4.3) and so i can get twice as much on...  DT is really nice
since I have 59 replayers for it and I don't have to find other music players
for different module types...

Hmmm... Well, if you can get a hold of the new CED, then do it.  It's such a
substantial improvement!

About the RKMs, I'm planning on getting the Libraries one.  It's the most
important...

Subject: signal/Noise ratio on this mailing list

Guys - I hate to say it but recently the amount of bandwidth occupied with
(apologies to the parties concerned but...) tedious personal conversations
about stuff that doesn't really concern the E language or isn't likely
to interest anyone other than the participants has increased! It was quite
a good list in the early days, with people posting real code, and things like
the "what is everyone working on" threads, but now its getting slow...

I'm sorry if I offend anyone, and I'm prepared to unsubscribe if anyone
really objects to my comments, but, hey - lets try and get some _coding_
discussions back in this list!

I guess I'd better practise what I preach - unfortunately I haven't got any
code with me at the moment (I'm at work) but next week (real soon now!) I'm
going to add some boopsi scrolling gadgets to the window of my latest
project. In order to learn about E and Intuition, I'm writing A Really Simple
Editor (ARSE for short!) 'cos I don't actually like any of the PD/SW ones
I've seen (except JEd which I use now). I'd also like someone to volunteer to
test it under Enforcer (I only have an A600) for me - any offers?

Again, sorry if I upset anyone but lets stick to the subject at hand - other
stuff you can do by e-mail.

Looking forward to replies / flames / etc.

Dave (daves@fulrcum.co.uk)

I'm sure it's possible.

Hmmmm.  It's not really what I need.  Sorry...  It has to use the blitter to
grab the letters from another screen and scroll then across the lowermost
screen.  I don't know how to get the blitter to work properly.  I try to pull
someting and scroll it, but it doesn't get it right.  It just pulls an empty
colour 0 box across.....

Any ideas?

Subject: HAM

[Dave has answered some of my questions about HAM6:] 

No, I am never doing a SetAPen(rp, 4095).

The largest value colour index you can use in HAM6 is 63.

The HAM6 demo program is quite simple to do, actually, it
just takes a bit of forethought ;^). Each square is 18
horizontal by 16 vertical pixels. Why 18? That's to
account for the fringing effect.

The first thing you must note is that drawing with colours
>16 in HAM6 is when you start using HOLD AND MODIFY
properly. Pixels drawn in colours 16 to 63 are not normal
palette values, but are more like commands to the display
chip. It is entirely possible, and probable, for two
pixels with the same colour *index* to have different
colour *appearances* on screen.

The first column of pixels in each square is set to a
modify blue colour, between 16 and 31. The top left square
is 16, the bottom right is 31. If you left the program in
this state you would get 16 vertical lines which graduated
between $000 and $00F.

The second column of pixels is set to a modify red
colour. The top pixel in each square is set to 32, going
down to 47 at the bottom. Now each square has a red
component of 0 along its top line, graduating to 15 along
its bottom line. If you left the program in this state,
you would get vertical lines again, with the first going
from $000 to $F00, the second from $001 to $F01.... until
the last which goes from $00F to $F0F.

The green is added by drawing vertical lines with colour
values between 48 and 63. The third column in each square
is colour 48, the fourth is 49 and so on until the 18th
column is colour 63.

Using these drawing techniques means that at some point on
the screen, every colour is present. For example, colour
$F72 would be 2 squares along, 7 pixels down and 15 pixels
across.

Does that make things clearer?

Here's a diagram showing the 2nd square on the 2nd row:

I've labelled the columns for reference. Each 3 figure
value represents the actual colour of each pixel in terms
of $RGB. Note that this is not the same as the colour
index of each pixel.

         B   R   G0  G1  G2  G3  G4  G5

Row 0 : 005 005 005 015 025 035 045 055 ...
Row 1 : 005 105 105 115 125 135 145 155 ...
Row 2 : 005 205 205 215 225 235 245 255 ...
Row 3 : 005 305 305 315 325 335 345 355 ...
Row 4 : 005 405 405 415 425 435 445 455 ... 
        ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

The first column, which I've called B (for Blue) modifies
the blue component. As this is the 5th square (counting
from 0), the blue component is set to 5 using a value of
16+5=21. So, all pixels in column B are drawn using
SetAPen(rp, 21).

The next column is R for Red which sets the red component.
The red component is linked to the vertical offset. So,
Row 0 = Red 0, Row 1 = Red 1 and so on. This is done using
SetAPen(rp, 32+row).

The 16 other columns change the green component with
respect to the horizontal offset. So, all pixels in column
G0 were drawn with SetAPen(rp,48). Row G1 was drawn with
SetAPen(rp,49), row G2 with pen 50 and so on.

Hopefully you can see how it is done now. The program is a
bit confusing because I've used the same loop variable for
both horizontal and vertical purposes for program speed.

Mail this to the list if you think it would be of help to
other people. If there's anything I've not explained
clearly enough, then mail me and I can edit it before it
goes on the list.

Cheers

Dave

P.S. To answer your question about colour 3000. I assume
you're talking in decimal here, which makes 3000 colour
$BB8, a sort of murky creamy colour (yuk! ;^)

To get this on a HAM screen:

I'll assume you're starting from black, which is colour 0
(for argument's sake). Colour 0 is set to black using
LoadRGB4(ViewPortAddress(win),[0],1)

Now, stick a black pixel on the screen (note that border
pixels not actually on the screen count as colour 0).

---------------------------------------------------------
[Question inserted:
Could I do SetAPen()s on a negative x pixel, thus doing 
my modifying off screen and causing pixel 0 to contain
the modified color I want?  If it's possible, this could
also be used to reduce fringing.  I guess from your 
previous statement that you cannot change the color of a
pixel that is off screen?]
---------------------------------------------------------

On the pixel immediately to the right, you put a colour
index of 16+8=24, which turns that pixel to colour $008.

On the pixel to the right of that one, you put a colour
index of 32+$B=44, which turns the pixel to colour $B08.

On the pixel to the right of that one, you put a colour
index of 48+$B=59, which turns that pixel to colour $BB8,
as required.

To continue the colour as $BB8 to then end of the line,
you could use indices of *either* 24, 44 or 59. These were
used to make the colour, and will modify the blue, red or
green component respectively to the same as it already is,
thereby maintaining the colour.

If you had a colour in your palette which was closer to
$BB8, you could use that. For example, if colour 5 was set
to $BBB, then you would need a pixel of that and then a
pixel of 24 to modify the blue component to 8. This reduces
fringing.

Don't really know what's going on here, but if the package has a .fd file,
there exists a util floating around somewhere that converts .fd to pragmas.
I'll see if I can scare it up.

I think MUI comes with a .fd file, doesn't it?  So if I'm correct in
thinking there's an FD2Pragma program floating around, we could at
least have the necessary module for the function calls, and any
structures, etc., could be converted by hand.

Subject: Images

Hi all!

    I need to hard code an image into my program (LOGO) and I'm having
problems.  I have a 135x75 4 bitplane image. I have had a program generate C
source for it, but it comes out to each line being 9 elements with 75 lines
per bitplane and 4 bitplanes. EC is telling me that there is a "too sizy
expression"....I am defining it as a PTR TO INT and everything that was used
in the busy pointer exapmle...but it don't work!

    This is just a little nicety I want to add to my program...it's not as
important as, say, MUI :-)

/*
   SetPointer() demo.  Compile and run.  Click left mouse button in window
   to see the Busy Pointer.  Click the right mouse button in window to quit.

   Eric, I have modified Dave's example to make the function that sets the
   pointer a little more reusable.  In order for it to work right some things
   must be considered:
   1.  In order for the pointer size calculation to work, pointerImage must
       be a List of INT.  Since E variables are even-byte aligned, and the
       pointer data are paired, we can use CopyMemQuick().  This is a bonus,
       but the gain is not significant with this small data size.
   2.  If you don't open your own window, then (I think) you must go through
       a lot of hassle to get a pointer to the Workbench window.  If anyone
       knows differently, please let us know.
   3.  You have to know a little about images in order to code them.  There
       are some utils out there to capture the pointer to C source code, or
       convert a brush to C source code.  You'll have to hunt for those.
       If you want a tutorial on how to construct image data, I might could 
       cook something up for you.  RKRMs discuss it, but rather tersely.

    I have already converted the pragma file that comes with it, to get the
function calls...but Stefan wrote the include file with MACROS so that you
don't have to go through all the trouble of duplicating 10 lines of source for
every window/gadget/etc which are all openended.  Plus the structures need to
be converted. I suppose it would be "possible" to live with just the main
function calls, but I don't know how to convert by hand.  THATS what I'm
asking for. 

    Every body should get this (MUI) even if they don't even do programming. 
There are going to be a bunch of applications using this RSN (like a term
program with RIP gfx)...I think this is good enough for C= to "adopt" into the
next OS release...NO THAT WOULD BE AWESOME!

Someone typed:

>the integration (compilation/line highlighting/etc)

Many editors offer this.  What I'd like to see in an integrated E environment
is a way for you to customize the environment to use ARexx commands specific
to your editor.  So if you want to use your editors' facility for text search,
you could do that.. if you wanted its facility for replacing text, you could
do that, etc.  A tricky thing to program, though.. probably impossible to do.
But if it could be done, it would offer the greatest flexibility to the user,
who wouldn't have to run out and buy a new text editor that matches the
specifications of the other editor's environment (for example, my favorite 
editor is 'QED,' which offers lots of ARexx support, but not too many people
use it, since it hasn't gotten around for some reason.. but I've already paid
for it, and I don't really want to have to pay for another text editor just
because I bought the wrong one).

Gad.. huge paragraph.  Sorry.

Dave, I agree that I'd like to see more code, USEFUL code.  However, I think we 
have a group of rather concientious individuals, and I find that most messages 
are pertinent.  When they are not, I usually reply privately and immediately.

Also, if subscribers aren't posting code, how else ya gonna stir it up?
Certainly not by generally flaming everybody!  Makes me wonder if *I* have to

Nope, I don't have access to that.  But soon Rinaldo will get nets and ftps. 
But even without that, it's the best BBS.

Subject: Horrible Noise...


	I've started posting replies to inappropriate messages, too.  In fact,
I've noticed that the majority of them are coming from one person.  I'm hoping
that this one person figures out that he's accidentally posting stuff he
probably intends as private to the mailing list.  I am also hoping this one
person figures out how to solve the problem, and handle his mail a little more
carefully.  If this one person doesn't modify his/her behavior, I will be
forced to ask that I be dropped from this mailing list (the only one I'm on,
because all the others I've ever been on got too noisy, and I don't have enough
room to manage it).  This would really cause a lot of urine to collect in my
Cheerios (to play off an old American saying).

	My apologies for typing such a message here, but so far, I read about
three people who find the signal-noise ratio getting rather high here
(including myself).  Surely something can be done to help cut it down a little
bit.

Woops, sorry about that last null post.....

OK, here is it for real....

You can totally screw things up if you do things "wrong" like forget to to an
ErrorCheck on a command, or specify a rast, not a vport and stuff like that. 
Things will run fine, but then the memory gets fragemented and that's what
causes the GURU.

Subject: Multi Windows!!!!

Jeez ... 70 mail messages waiting for me on Monday morning!

I hate Mondays :-)

Anyway, this is an example of how to use multiple windows
from one task.

The bug was caused by this line:

WHILE (IF u THEN msg:=GetMsg(u) ELSE 0)

where u is the userport of the window and msg is a pointer
to an intuimessage. I could see no problem with this line.
The original intention was that the loop would end if
either there were no messages, or u became NIL.

I re-arranged the program slightly without this statement
and now it works.

Have fun!

Dave.

Subject: Readargs examples

These are two small programs which make use of the
Readargs call in KickStart 2 (so you need KS2+ to run
them).

The first is a simple encryption program which is very
unlikely to win any prizes for data security, but it will
protect against the average intruder.

The second is a command called SetPen. This can be used to
change the attributes of the pen in the CLI window. For
example, you can select BOLD, ITALIC, UNDERSCORE, REVERSE,
FGPEN and BGPEN. There is also a RESET option.

Dave.

Subject: iff mods and example

These are modules for the IFF.library which was posted
last week. I could not get any structures out of Iconvert
or Pragma2Module, no matter how hard I tried.

These are two structures, BMHD and ANH. These are
currently held in assembly format in libraries/iff.m. I
have no idea how E's module system works, so someone else
will have to convert these to OBJECTs.

Also included is a small ShowIFF utility which I wrote
using the modules. I have tested it with lots of different
pictures, including HAM, but I don't have any HAM8 or
overscan pictures to test with it.

I think there may be a small bug in the program. It uses
an empty image structure to blank the mouse pointer by
allocating 20 bytes of chip memory. It frees this memory
at the end of the program, but I think this may be wrong
and the line which says FreeMem(sprite,20) may need
deleting.

I would appreciate it if someone else could clarify this.

Dave.

yeah, I know, this is a silly limitation in EC v2.1b (see hardcoded
limits in ref.doc). I hope to remove this in the next version.
 
for now, if you really want the pic to be _in_ the executable, you
could try something like (after all PROCs):
 
mypic:
 
INT $ABAD,$CAFE,$DEAD,$BEEF,...
INT $1234,$5678,$9ABC,...
INT ...
 
as far a I know, this has no size-limits.
 
or you can dump the data altogether, and use INCBIN at the same spot.
 
and then later on:
 
CopyMem({mypic},mychipmem,mysize)

hey! you don't need to scream! :-)
I've already contacted stefan stuntz, and I'll see what I can do.
Sofar it seems that the MUI also relies on the macro-preproccessing
capabilities of the C-preprocessor.
(didn't it also support Oberon?)

Subject: iffmods - complete (i think)

In here:
iff.m               - iff.library v22.1 function definitions
libraries/iff.m     - iff.library v22.1 constant and structure definitions
libraries/iff-old.m - iff.library pre-v22 error names (they were there so I
                      included them, but they're separate since they were 
                      commented; never know if they'll be useful)

Enjoy.

Subject: BusyPointer.e (update)

/*
   SetPointer() demo.  Compile and run.  Click left mouse button in window
   to see the Busy Pointer.  Click the right mouse button in window to quit.

   The previous version did not free memory properly (thanks to Dave for
   pointing that out!)  I made the mistaken assumption that once I gave the
   image to the window the window would free the image for me.  WRONG!  You
   have to hang onto the image and free it after closing the window.  In
   order for it to work right some things must be considered:
   1.  In order for the pointer size calculation to work, pointerImage must
       be a List of INT.  Since E variables are even-byte aligned, and the
       pointer data are paired, we can use CopyMemQuick().  This is a bonus,
       but the gain is not significant with this small data size.
   2.  If you don't open your own window, then (I think) you must go through
       a lot of hassle to get a pointer to the Workbench window.  If anyone
       knows differently, please let us know.
   3.  You have to know a little about images in order to code them.  There
       are some utils out there to capture the pointer to C source code, or
       convert a brush to C source code.  You'll have to hunt for those.
       (Dave, how did you do it?)  If you want a tutorial on how to construct
       image data, I might could cook something up for you.  RKRMs discuss
       it, but rather tersely.
   4.  You must save the address returned by setPointer(), then call
       freePointer() after closing the window.
   5.  You can reset the pointer image to the intuition default by calling
       ClearPointer(win).  If you are not closing the window, you *must* do
       "ClearPointer(); freePointer()" in that order.  If you reverse the
       order, your task will crash if your window is active or becomes activated
       in between the calls.
   Thanks again, Dave, for your replies (and for the "private data"
   suggestion. :-)

Well folks, I'm off for a quick vacation tommorrow. This means that for
one week, from Aug. 20-27, I'll be away from the list and requests to
subscribe, unsubscribe, etc., will have to wait until I get back. 

When I get back, I'll be posting some ADMIN articles, including some
posting guidelines, and a reminder to remember the amigae-request
address when making administrative requests.

Hope you all enjoy the next week, and with any luck bkhouse will stay
up and running throughout! :)

Thanks for your patience.

Subject: Pointer and Screen button stuff

Ok, I have a great deal of code finshed on my musicdisk.  But there's 2 things
bugging me that I can't figure out how to deal with...

        1) How can I get rid of that screen shuffle button on the top right
        of my screens?

        2) How can I make a custom pointer on 1 screen, and leave the other
        pointer defitions on the other screens blank?  So, when you pass
        the pointer from 1 screen to the other, it will dissapear, and
        reapear on the the 'main screen'.

I have a setup of 3 screens with no windows (I write directly to the
rastports)...

Ok, thanx in advance...

Hi everybody out there in `E' land!

    I need _MORE_HELP_! (Crowd yells "yeah!" :-)  I am really starting to
move on my EDS project, and need some help getting my editor started.  (I am
having to use an external editor, cause none of you are willing to give me
your source for your text editors).  I need to use file notification WHILE
the file is being edited. This means that I have to have the editor started
ASYNCHRONOUSLY! 
    My two choices for doing this Asynch are using runback (blah!) or
System().  I only have the RKM:Libs, so I have no idea how to use System()!
So I am here pleading with all you for mercy! 
    If anyone has a listing of dos functions (Autodocs) could you post them
or uuencode me if they are BIG, or if you have examples of using this, or
BOTH :-)  I need this ASAP....in other words BEFORE I LOSE STEAM!

Subject: Politikil Editor Plea

Its hard for me to believe that between the Fred Fish disks and emacs
(especially the GNU version) that you can't get access to an editor. It may
be for the best, IMHO use of an external editor would provide a more flexible,
easy to maintain product. The main thrust of your question was for information
about how to launch the external editor. Have you looked at Arex? It might
provide an answer to your questions about how to launch the external editor
and for those editors with an Arexx interface it might also allow the benefits
of an internal editor within your product while at the same time providing
the user of product flexibility in their choice of an editor environment. BTW
in the first sentence of this message I am refering to editor source files,
the editor I have available on this system is brain-dead.

The CATS CD is for developers only.  The 2.0 Includes and Autodocs
are in the Addison Wesley   Amiga Rom Kernel Manual "Includes and
Autodocs" and are probably also still available as the 2.0 Native
Developer Update.  I am working on the 3.x Native Developer Update
which I hope to finish soon.  At that time, it will be available
for purchase by anyone (floppies)

BTW - The CATS CD is a CD-ROM

    Try Computer Basics/AmigaMan (same company)...they do have the RKMs, and
an ok discount too.  You can get the whole set for about $100, or seperately
for about $10 off each.

    Also try FFish Disk 741 and 742 (I think) have the exapmles from RKM
libs and Devices. They are in C, but you might be able to decipher the code
and convert it to E.  It will at least show how to open the serial port.

Sorry, I can't help here ... I have 6 manuals for KS1.3 (non-ECS) and the 
2.04 AmigaDOS Manual, but I can't even get the newer manuals, let alone
autodocs.  I'm highly annoyed that Commodore doesn't produce a smaller
update book for those of us who have already shelled out $300 for (now
essentially useless) old manuals.

I haven't used 'serial.device' in E yet, but it should be essentially
identical to C usage ... here's my first attempt.  (I can't really test
it, I'm using the serial port to post this, so it would fail)


MODULE 'Devices/Serial'
RAISE "Dev" IF OpenDevice()=NIL,  /*...and other error handlers */
DEF request:PTR TO ioextser
  OpenDevice('serial.device', unit, request, 0)
  request.command := SDCMD_SETPARAMS
  request.extflags := 0
  request.baud := myBaudRate
  request.serflags := SERF_RAD_BOOGIE + SERF_7WIRE
  DoIO(request)


This has set up the serial device for future use.  RAD_BOOGIE specifies that
no character checking is to be performed - no xON/xOFF, parity, break signal,
and assumes 8-bit characters.  It runs at higher speed.


/* Reading from the serial port */
  request.command := SDCMD_QUERY
  DoIO(request)
  blockSize := request.length  /* get all unread bytes; no more, no less */
/* if port pin values are needed, 'request.status' contains the bits */
  request.command := CMD_READ
  request.length := blockSize
  request.data := readBuffer
  DoIO(request)
 

If you wish to read a block of characters of known size, skip the SDCMD_QUERY
step and just put the block size in 'request.length'.  If you want to read 
NUL- or EOL-terminated lines, you add 'SERF_EOFMODE' to the 'request.serflags'
field of the initial 'SDCMD_SETPARAMS' request, and set 'request.termarray[]'
to a list of valid end-of-read characters.

Writing is simpler; just set up 'data', command and 'length' fields to the
obvious values.  '-1' in 'length' means a null-terminated string.


Repeat warning:  I haven't tested this code in E, so there may be problems
with it.  You'll also need to fill in the error-handling details.

I can see the server code becoming *huge* in short order.  The server needs
to decide (look up) what engine 7 does, it's effect on rotation and velocity,
radar and IR signatures, fuel consumption rates, etc.  There will probably
be multiple players at any given instant, and multiple controls from each 
player.  It also has to coordinate the transfers of all information to/from
clients.  This is just the -skeleton- of its operation.

What models do we have already for rotation, acceleration, gravity, impact
and heat?  I mean just the mathematical models, not implementation.

> 	oh, we WILL make it go on 2400, since that's what i've got :)

Me too, and I've written a multi-player action game before:  it's a bitch!
The main problem is that it is really low on bandwidth.  So you need to
compress the information to keep the frame rate up.  However, the error
detection/correction data chews up a chunk of each frame.  Then you find
that sometimes there's just *too much* data, and you get 'slow frames'.
Also, 1/10th of a second deosn't look like much on screen, but you get
drift between each program's world-view which can cause weird errors.
'Manually' synchronising the systems introduces yet more data to be squashed
along that narrow communication line.  If you're lucky, you have a model
that can automatically synchronise without needing to be told.  Otherwise,
you have to choose between rewriting the model (and associated code), or
living with uneven frame rates with noticeable pauses.

(Whew.  Now that I've got that out of my system, I can start to think
positively again!)

Do I hear a hint for Amiga work?  I should be able to do some porting.
I have written a number of 3D graphics routines, and I can handle serial or
parallel port communications.  Minus - I don't know much about TCP/IP, SLIP
or Ethernet; and I am worse than abyssmal at creating good user interfaces.

Subject: Spawning a process with E


Some people here were asking how to do this (Politikill especially, for the
development thingy).  I had to figure out how to do this when trying to get my
Quip program to run an external command, and I *think* I've got the right idea.

There are a couple of ways to do this... although both ways are NOT
asynchronous (to do this asynchronously I guess you'd have to do something like
"RUN <name of prog & args>"), perhaps it might point to a way...

Execute() & SystemTagList()

success = Execute (commandString, input, output)
D0	 	   D1		  D2	 D3

BOOL Execute (char *, BPTR, BPTR)

Running this will cause whatever's in your output variable (stdout/in) to be
used for your command's stdio.  The bad thing about using this command is that
it doesn't return the result of the command (therefore, no error-checking can
be done by finding out how the editor Exit()ed).

The really cool thing, for my money, is to use the SystemTagList command
(available V36 on... so be careful if you want to use this).

error = SystemTagList(command, tags)
D0		      D1       D2

LONG SystemTagList(UBYTE *, struct TagItem *)

This one will return an error for you.  Of course, if you're RUNning the
command, I suppose you could stick with Execute without any trouble.

Another thing cool about this, however, is you can try something like...

error := SystemTagList('editor',[SYS_ASYNCH,SYS_USERSHELL])

...which would run your command asynchronously (I forgot about that).

Other tag items of use... [SYS_INPUT,Input(),SYS_OUTPUT,Output()]

Be careful.. using SYS_ASYNCH will cause whatever is passed as
SYS_INPUT/SYS_OUTPUT to be closed when the command is done.. even if it was
your own Input()/Output() packets!  You might want to consider either making
these values '0', or giving the command its own little console window to write
in.

As for where to get the ROM Kernel Reference Manual, I think you have to
contact Commodore by mail or phone and order the manuals, if you can't get them
by a local store or something (I'm somewhat lucky.. I can drive a couple
hundred miles to get at them <sigh>).

The Manuals are published in a bound format by Addison-Wesley Publishing
Company, Inc.  The ISBN of the RKRM is 0-201-56773-3, and it's noted as
Commodore item number 327271-07.

Commodore Applications and Technical Support (CATS) may offer some help, too..
from the book:

Commodore maintains a technical support group dedicated to helping developer
achieve their goals with the Amiga.  Currently, technical support programs are
available to meet the needs or both smaller, independent software cevelopers
and larger corporations.  Subscriptions to Commodore's technical support
publication, Amiga Mail, is available to anyone with an interest in the latest
news, Commodore software and hardware changes, and tips for developers.

To request an application for Commodore's developer supprt program, or a list
of CATS technical publications send a self-addressed, stamped, 9"x12" envelope
to:

I was under the impression that you had to be a registered developer with
C= before they would let you have the Autodocs.  I also heard it was about
100 pounds to register (a bit out of my league) - Maybe the 'E' group
could register and we could share them ;-)

If this is true then it's a shame.  C= want everyone to program correctly,
yet they will not tell us HOW unless we pay, and the only way I can think
of making the money is to write some decent utils (which I can't write
without the Autodocs help!).  Silly (but I guess the need the money).

    Ahhh, well....it's no biggie. I don't need it rigt now anyway.

    BTW: What did you think of the last version I sent you (EDS)? I am going
to have to send you the latest version...I am having a problem using the
notify function of Dos...the sample program that comes with E works fine on
my machine, but I haven't been able to get it to work inside EDS :-( I am
getting pretty pissedat this, cause I seem to be doing everything right, but
there must be some conflict with someting else.  I have one more thing to
try, having my task identifier defined as an PTR TO tc (not done in
watch.e)...but that is the only thing I can think of.  I am making sure the
file has no outstanding locks on it, and that the siganl is being allocated,
and all that crap.  
    I do notice that the notifyrequest structure is different in E than it
it described in the RKMs...(Well, sort of described :-)...the RKMs say to
initialise nreq.nr_stuff.nr_signalnum and nreq.nr_stuff.nr_port (I think)
but E doesn't support objects like that (yet) so I think thats why they are
different.
    In case you're wondering, I want to do this cause I need to know when a
change is made to the file loaded into the editor so that the changes also
show up in the file in memory and that I can ask the user if he/she/it
(can't forget to be politically correct, even tho I have yet to see a
message from a more feminine E progger, in this day in age) wants to make
revision comments when the file is saved.  This make much more sense than
waiting for the program to end, cause I know I don't quit the program
everytime I make a change to the source and compile it! :-) 
    I saw CEd today (3.5) and it sucks! There is no way in hell I will ever
support it! I am sorry, but that interface is so "blaaaaaahhh"! I had never
seen a copy of it before, and hope I don't have to again. When someone shows
me something that can beat JEd or that I can change myself (through E) I
might give it up...but so far it is _THE_ OS 2.x+ Editor of choice! I really
don't know what all the fuss about 3.5 coming out is...it really doesn't do
too much well.  I think the programmers tried to make it TOO backward
compatible, and ended up making is ass backwards. The first thing that
turned me off was the prop gadget. Still the old 1.3 style square in a big
(pattern filled) verticle rectangle (no beveling)...should be gadtools or
intuition looking like gadtools. Even better would have been a little 2.0
style custom imagery for the prop_gad. Then the menus...those are strange...

    I am sure it has very nice features, but I can't stand something that
looks gawdy! It has to be newlook or nothing.  And it has to be compatible
with MagicMenus (no custom backfill in the menus)...BIG reason why terminus
never made it onto a hotkey :-)

    And, if you are wondering why all this babble is in reply to your
message, it beats me :-) The CEd stuff is just my Not_So_Humble_Opinion...
and is in this message cause I'm bored and feel like typing and am
stuck/frustrated with progging, but the rest of the stuff up there should
interest you.  If I don't get notify working, expect to see a UUEncoded form
in your mailbox sometime tomorrow :-)

    I have made a lot of improvements tho! I'll make some of the necessary
changes for you to run it on your system, like removing the image and making
it 16 instread of 32 colors...still using the Xen.font so that doesn't need
to be changed...you will need to replace the mode ID again. I forget what it
was I told you...and it will be easier for you to look at the old EDS source
than for me to look it up...

I don't know very much at all about EDS, by I surmised that it is some sort
of an E integrated development environment system. Re: some of your other
questions: the system I use for the amigae mailing list is indeed a Unix
system running on a Tamdem machine. I only get 16 lines for messages I write.
Re: launching programs aschronously (sorry about spelling), I have written
a little utility in E that detaches itself from the shell/cli it was started
from by doing a CreateProc on its own seglist. I'm not sure what the other
person told you about launching an external program, but the method I just
mentioned could also be used to launch an external program by using LoadSeg
to get a seglist for it and then using CreateProc (or CreateNewProc, if
you are generating 37 and later code). BTW, the reason I use this system is
that it is on a FreeNet and I thereby get access to Internet email at no
charge (such as it is).

re: multi-player, serial-line (read: LOOOOOOW bandwidth required)
games and the like, I've read several informative chapters of a
book called CYBERSPACE: FIRST STEPS.  Sorry, don't have complete
ref with me (I'm at work), but there are several chapters on the
theory of information density in just such systems, including one
about some multi-user world written to run at 1200 baud off C=64's.
  I believe the main point of it was: OOP, OOP, OOP! (and more OOP!).
If the environment is completely object-oriented, then you can simply
update features of objects through very small signals. In addition,
the server should simply run as a 'world-manager', sending updates to
the clients.  The clients, OTOH, contain complete object specifications
and the like.

  The article also gets into how to resolve conflicts, e.g., two or
more people acting on the same object at the same time, etc.

  Someone remind me and I'll make it a point to bring the ref with me
to work tomorrow.

OOP is definitely the way to go.  It would be all but impossible to do this
sort of project without using object-oriented design.  The problem is that
"very small signals" is a relative term.  Completely resending all the data
is obviously out of the question, but even data increments are a tight
squeeze.  To recap: at 2400 baud, with 5 players, and a desired frame-rate
of 10 per second, all the data from each player must fit in 6 bytes/frame.
This needs to include all overheads for transfer protocol.  6 bytes is not
much to work with.  Without compression, you could easily fill it just
with rotation info.

In this case, it is not so much of a problem - I don't expect much control
conflict in this game.  Players control their own craft, and everything
else is controlled by the server.  It will put a large load on the server,
though.

Tim -
  6 bytes/frame per user? At what fps? 30?  (just looked..10 is what you said).
Well, you may want to consider that this is 60 bytes (you sure it isn't bits?)
per second.  
  Now, then.  Consider:  how many actions are possible per user per second?
                         how many SIMULTANEOUS actions are possible per user/second?
                         #1 and #2, but at user/frame level?

If you've got 6 BYTES/frame, this gives you 48bits/frame, or 480 bits/second.
Even if half of that is protocol, you still have 240 bits/second, which should
be more than enough once you consider #1,2,and 3 above.

(Alternatively, just write the thing to maximize bpf or bps and #1,2, and 3 above).

If, OTOH, you're working with 6 BITS/frame, it could be tight, although if you
 seriously restrict the items mentioned in 1,2,and 3 above, it could still work.

Sounds neat.  Lemme know how it comes out.

The CATS CD is for developers only.  The 2.0 Includes and Autodocs
are in the Addison Wesley   Amiga Rom Kernel Manual "Includes and

Developer Update.  I am working on the 3.x Native Developer Update
which I hope to finish soon.  At that time, it will be available
for purchase by anyone (floppies)

BTW - The CATS CD is a CD-ROM

Re: Your request for a copy of my code that does a CLI/Shell detach by
doing a asymchronous launch of itself.
I have made a archive containing my code, source and docs available via ADS.
The name of the archive is TrkDsp.lzh. It was spawned around the first of
July and should be available from any BBS that has the ADS files. If for some
reason, this won't work for you, let me know and alternative arrangements can
be made. BTW, this same program, which is an E clone of Olaf Barthel's
program called TrackDisplay (Olaf's program (in C) can be found on FF 399)
also sets up an interrupt server (tied to the vertical blank interrupt) too.
Most of the interrupt-related code is in imbedded assembly. I personally
only have wb 1.3, but my E_TrackDisplay code has been also tested sucessfully
on an A4000/040. OOPS!!!, a small correction is required. The title of my
archive is ETrkDsp.lha.

All of the examples to the RKRM Manuals for version 2.04 are
available on Fred Fish disks 741 and 742 and the IFF docs are
available on disk 674.
 
The autodocs for 2.04 are available from Commodore for $20.00.
 
AmigaDOS 2.0 Native Developers Update
 
Commodore Business Machines
1200 Wilson Drive
West Chester, PA  19380
 
(215) 431-9100
 
I got this info from The Winter' 93 AC's Guide for the Amiga on page
65.
 
I hope this helps.  If your looking for the autodocs for 2.1 or 3.0,
I believe the only way to get them is by becoming a registered
developer with commodore.  To do that you need to write to CATS and
ask for the application.

Yes, you told me about it once already, and I had my Sysop go on the lookout
for it, but he has recenlty cut his connection, I think, or at least limited
it.  I just went looking out at FTP@wuarchive.wustl.edu, and it is not
there. it sounds like a small program, so if you could either post it as
direct source or UUEncoded....that'd be great.

What is the E equivalent to

or

struct View *oldview;

I guess my question is "what is (struct) ?"

Subject: ARexx

Hi Everyone! 
        Its about time for MORE HELP! 

        This time I need some conversion help on the subject of ARexx! I
have a little bit of source on sending an ARexx message which comes from the
editor I am having to use, cause no one has an editor to send me (another
SHAMELESS plug) which came with source (But there is a NO USE IN ANOTHER
EDITOR condition)....

        Since I don't know much about ARexx (from the development side) I
thought I'de ask around.  Here is just the function to send a message...

sendRexxCmd(STRPTR s, int(*f)(), STRPTR p1, STRPTR p2, STRPTR p3, LONG m)
{
    struct MsgPort *rexxport;
    struct RexxMsg *RexxMsg;

    if((!rexxPort) || (stillNeedReplies > MAXRXOUTSTANDING-1))
        return(FALSE);
    RexxMsg = NULL;
    if(openRexxLib() && (RexxMsg =
             CreateRexxMsg(rexxPort, extension, rexxPort->mp_Node.ln_Name)) &&
             (RexxMsg->rm_Args[0] = CreateArgstring(s, (long)strlen(s))))
    {
        RexxMsg->rm_Action = RXCOMM | m;
        RexxMsg->rm_Args[1] = (STRPTR)f;
        RexxMsg->rm_Args[2] = p1;
        RexxMsg->rm_Args[3] = p2;
        RexxMsg->rm_Args[4] = p3;
        RexxMsg->rm_Node.mn_Node.ln_Name = RXSDIR;
        Forbid();
        if(rexxport = FindPort(RXSDIR))
            PutMsg(rexxport, (struct Message *)RexxMsg);
        Permit();
        if(rexxport)
        {
            stillNeedReplies++;
            return(RexxMsg);
        }
        else
            DeleteArgstring(RexxMsg->rm_Args[0]);
    }
    if(RexxMsg)
        DeleteRexxMsg(RexxMsg);
    closeRexxLib();
    return(FALSE);
}

I doubt the still need replies part needs to be used in my case...I just
need to send a message (for example, to jump to some certain line) for now.
It might be nice to get a return code, but is not crucial yet. I would like
to be able to just call a function from anywhere like
sendRXMsg('JED.1','Find "test"') and perhaps have it return whatever was in
the return code. 

Code taken from MinRexx.C from the JED Version 2.07 source archive   JHarper

    I have just started a mini-Arexx port, using source from JEd 2.07 and
Toolmanager 2.1(mostly), and I am having problems doing both of the above. 
I have tried both assigning the function to a variable (and get illegal us
of...) and doing it directly.  Lemme show you the function the way it should
be when converted from C to E:

PROC sendrxmsg(rxcmd,len,prt)
DEF rc,
    rxmsg:PTR TO rexxmsg,
    aport:PTR TO mp,
    dummyport,tmpmsg

  IF (rexxsysbase:=OpenLibrary('rexxsyslib.library',0))
    IF (rxmsg:=CreateRexxMsg(dummyport,NIL,NIL))
      IF rxmsg.args[0]:=CreateArgstring(rxcmd,len)
        rxmsg.action:=RXCOMM OR RXFB_NOIO

        Forbid()
        aport:=FindPort(prt)
        IF aport THEN PutMsg(aport,rxmsg)
        Permit()
        IF aport
          WaitPort(dummyport)
          GetMsg(dummyport)
          rc:=rxmsg.result1
        ENDIF
      ClearRexxMsg(rxmsg,1)
      ENDIF
    DeleteRexxMsg(rxmsg)
    ENDIF
  CloseLibrary(rexxsysbase)
  ENDIF
ENDPROC rc

So, if someone could come up with a way to help me here (I have found an
easier port than the last source I sent out...) it would be greatly
appreciated, and of course, now a almost functional ARexx message sender
source function is out for all you to use!

Does anyone have a fade routine that can fade to whatever colour you want? 
Something that is like:

So then I can use fade(s3,FFF) or something like that?  Any tips or

Subject: Problems with objects


I'm having a lot of trouble with something that should be very simple.  I
want to fill a rastport with a simple pattern.  So, I include MODULE
'Graphics/Rastport' and write code that includes the following:

  stdrast.areaptrn := pattern

where 'pattern' is my array of INTs.  The trouble is, I then get
 "ERROR: illegal use of/reference to object 
  LINE 35:   stdrast.areaptrn := pattern"

Why?
I've tried many variations on the theme, like making 'pattern' a LONG that
is assigned a value that points to the values, but it always boils down to
this error (or an error somewhere else as I try something incorrect, in my
desperation).

  Woops....it was 2:00 or so and I was getting real tired! But you did find

  No...that doesn't work. cause rxmsg.args never gets what was in
CreateArgstring().  But STUPID me! I found a perfect example last nite about
3 minutes after I sent out my mail...CompLine.e uses ARexx to communicate
with CED! I BE STUPID! :-)

  BUT, what that uses is PutLong(rxmsg.args,argptr)...another unreferenced
command in E ?

  You could go into a loop and do lower the value of the color by some unit
each time and get a nice smooth fade if you do it right. Using that method,
you could also work wout something where you can fade one color to another.

  fade(<screen>,<color REGISTER>, <new VALUE>)

  And then you would just have to work out some math in the loop.

Subject: Amiga support functions


I have noticed that E has not got any of the Amiga support
functions. These are the functions/procedures I am talking
about:

BeginIO
CreatePort
DeletePort
CreateStdIO
DeleteStdIO
CreateExtIO
DeleteExtIO
NewList
...and a few others which I can't remember

I think these are stored in the amiga.lib file when
working with C. I need them in order to do device I/O
using OpenDevice(). I have got Hisoft Highspeed Pascal,
which has these functions, in Pascal, in a unit file
Amiga.PAS. I am currently in the process of writing E
conversions, but it is difficult and the routines I have
done so far crash the machine.

Has anybody already got routines as above, in E? (Working
ones would be nice :-)). I am especially interested in
CreateExtIO/DeleteExtIO.

Dave.

P.S. Also, there are graphics macros missing as someone
mentioned in a previous post. These are CINIT, CMOVE,
CEND, ON_SPRITE, OFF_SPRITE and so on.

P.P.S. *If* I manage to get the routines working, I'll
pass them on (but don't hold your breath ;^) ).

P.P.P.S. If Wouter is reading this, any chance of getting
these built in to v2.5 of E?

I am now having a problem with my E programs crashing the machine when
I write to an object?  Here is the problem code....
OPJECT myobject

       top:CHAR
       width:INT

PROC main()

DEF myob:PTR TO myobject

myob.left:= 4
myob.top:= 6

myob.height:=89     I think it crash's about here....

Any Idea.  Is this the wrong way to write to objects?

Subject: Notify!?

Hi there everybody!
    I just realised that a major bug I have been tracking down (or trying
anyway) is not in my program, but in DOS (at least thats the way it seems
now :-)  Soooooo....here is my problem.  I am using an ASL file requester to
get a file, and then am trying to start a notify on it.  I couldn't get it
working, for some reason, because I was using an Assign as my directory
path. It loads, and everything else seems to accept it, but working in this
assign, it seems as if StartNotify() will not take a file with an assign as
its directory path.  so, I figure I need a way to convert an assign to a
full path.  Is there some dos function to expand it? Or is there something I
am missing.  I want people to be able to use assigns, and it is stupid if
they cannot.  I know it is possible, cause notification is set up on
everything in ENV:!

    I seem to have recently discovered a little, undocumented (?!) function
in E: PutLong(<to>,<from>)...and is used specifically for copying info from
one variable into an objects structure.  It may work for INTs, or there may
be another function like PutInt() or you may have to just work with a LONG. 
So you would call PutLong(stdrast.areaptrn,pattern) to copy the info into
the object.  Hpe this helps...I only discovered it by accident writing my
ARexx support, when I found Compline.e...!

Subject: Disadvantages!

There are certain disadvantages to working in a customized environment.
    I recently found another bug, that wasn't a bug! My notify troubles are
all worked out! I have my E stuff on an XFH volume (no compression) so that
I have another volume to access the stuff tucked 10 levels deep on my hard
drive in.  It seems that the dos notify functions do not like this XFH
setup, and will refuse to start notification. I just started to realise that
there was something wrong with the path to the files I was beta testing my
program with (older versions of the current program) when I was abe to start
notification on a file in the root directory of a device. So, i began to
think, and the first thing I thought of was ASSIGNS....it never occured to
me that this could be a problem with my XFH.  (You will all notice my last
help message, asking for a way to get the real path out of an
assign...forget it! :-)  I then got curious...I tried the notification
again, thistime in a file in C: (an assigned dir!) and it worked (sort of...
I had no message port or signal checking set up, so it was crash city when I
quit with messages hanging out in the air, but at least it STARTED
notification!)  So I went digging, and finally found my problem...XFH!  So,
a few mintues later, I had a new assign for my beta test area (this time
without the XFH volume as a root dir, but my HD as the root) and now all is
well! 

    To make a long story short at this point would be futile, so I will just
give the moral of the above story :-)

  "When you've searched your code Infinity++ times, and still can't see what
is wrong, begin to have confidence in programming skills, and look elsewhere
to place the blame for crashing programs and non-working functions."

[In reply to Jeffrey's 29 August message:]
Jeffrey,

The dos asl requester returns a *path* and a *filename*, even if you use a
logical device name as path in the file requester (in freq.path and freq.file,
where freq is a PTR TO filerequestr (sic))  Are you doing anything strange in 
your taglist?  I got my code straight from the Fish RKRM Companion.  You may 
want to look at it if you haven't already.

It's not undocumented, look in Chapter 9G, Math and Other Functions.  There is
a PutInt() and a PutChar(), also, which do work the was Jeffrey describes here.

>So you would call PutLong(stdrast.areaptrn,pattern) to copy the info into

Still won't work because stdrast is not an OBJECT identifier.  It is of type
LONG and has no structure field selectors.  You need something like:
/*---------------------------*/
MODULE 'graphics/rastport'
DEF rastPort : PTR TO rastport

PROC myPattern ()
  ...
ENDPROC  pattern

PROC main ()
  rastPort := stdrast

  /*-- rastPort _is_ an object identifier... --*/
  rastPort.areaptrn := myPattern ()

  /*-- OR, if you prefer... --*/
  PutLong (rastPort.areaptrn, myPattern ())
ENDPROC
/*---------------------------*/

Hello All,

one of my unix-accounts is down for a yet unknown time,
and since lots of people on this list mail me, I thought
I'd tell it here:

until further notice, don't send mail to wouter@mars.let.uva.nl,
but rather to either wouter@alf.let.uva.nl or oortmers@gene.fwi.uva.nl

If you mailed something important to "mars" lately and haven't received
any reply, feel free to repost it to one of the other addresses.

(norm: could you change my E-mailing list email to the "gene"
account?)

Wouter.

Subject: E Guru!

Hi!
  I need an E Guru to help me beta test and debug my program.

      Yes, EDS is almost to that point! Most everything is working, and all
that is left to do now is the niceties...preferences, tooltypes,
configurable buttons, etc.  SO!...I am looking for someone to make sure my
file I/O routines are correct, and if not help me fix them, and also someone
to help me find the 4 enforcer hits I have at startup, and the 4 ones when I
quit.  (only ones I have noticed). 

      Also, I could use some info...how do I get the PATH TO MY ICON from
Workbench? I have fiddled with WBStartup msg, but when I try to CurrentDir()
to the lock given by WB (as per the RKMs), it crashes.  I want to set up
some psuedo-prefs by tooltypes at first, then go to text file, then to IFF
PRHD form preferences file. So, if you all have any examples on how to do
such in E, lemme have'm?

    Well, why not? I mean CHANGE the values in whatever COLOR NUMBER you
want to fade.  How does a palette requester change the colors? just do
whatever it does INTERNALLY...I'm not sure REGISTER was the right term, but
you get what I mean...

Subject: MUI Version 1.3

Wouter!
    First off, I want to take the time to thank you for converting the C
header into a useable form in E (nice thinkin! I wouldn't have come up with
a work-around like that :-)...it must have taken a while.

    Secondly, I present to you (and everybody else) a problem: MUI relies
HEAVILY on the Amiga.lib function DoMethod.  This is what makes it so you
can connect one object to another, and have them talk to each other. Since
it is an Amiga.lib function, does this mean there is no way to use MUI until
there is a new EC (2.5) with some Amiga.lib functions? Or is there a way I
can do it _now_ ? (If I seem impatient, its because I go back to school in
ten days! :-( So I have _very_ little time to experiment)

    So, it seems that for right now, the includes are un useable.

No, this won't work. The original statement assigns a
value to a field within the rastport structure. This
statement assigns a value to the location that the field
points at.

So, if rastPort.areaptrn is NIL, then you will get a write
to location 0.

Theoretically, you could do this:

PutLong({rastPort.areaptrn},myPattern())

to get the desired result, but (if memory serves) E will
not allow this because only one variable name can go
inside the braces. You *could* look up the offset of
areaptrn and use rastPort+x instead, but the original
solution is much better.

Right, I stand corrected.

Try:
  IF (NameFromLock (fileLock, pathname, MAX_PATHNAMELENGTH)) = NIL ...

where fileLock is the lock you get from workbench, pathname is a string of
sufficient length, and MAX_PATHNAMELENGTH is the length of string pathname.
