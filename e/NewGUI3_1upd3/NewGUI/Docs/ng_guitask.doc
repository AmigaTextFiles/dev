guitaskinfo

SYNTAX:

        OBJECT  guitaskinfo
         maintask       :PTR TO tc
         guitask        :PTR TO tc
         tags           :PTR TO LONG
         gui            :PTR TO guihandle
         sig            :LONG
         signum         :INT
        ENDOBJECT

FUNCTION:

        This object-definition holds the important things for use with the
        new task and other related things like the allocated signal-number.
        Normally only the field (variable) gui is needed by the programmer!

        ATTENTION! Read only from this object! Don`t write things in it,
        this could crash the system! If you use variables (like gui) out
        of the object you must test it every time if it is NIL (than the
        gui is closed, the task killed and the object not longer valid!)

PARAMETERS:

        Do not write into the object!

RETURN:

        maintask        - PTR to the main-task from the program
        guitask         - PTR to the task for the guihandling
        tags            - PTR to the tags for use with newgui.m/guiinitA()
        gui             - PTR to the guihandle (check it to NIL every time
                          you use it!!)
        sig             - Signal-Mask for waiting or checking if the guitask
                          is finished / waiting for killing!
        signum          - Number of the allocated signal bit (for later
                          use in the ng_endtask() Procedure)

BUGS:

        None known!


ng_newtask()

SYNTAX:

        info:=ng_newtask(tags,stacksize)

FUNCTION:

        Initializes a new Task for guihandling and opens the gui with the
        given tags. The guitask could have a user-setable stacksize!

        ATTENTION! If you call this function, you have to wait one (1)
        time for the signal, this is to synchronize the two tasks.
        (if you don`t wait for this signal, it is not safe to get anything
        out of the guitaskinfo-structure!!!!)

PARAMETERS:

        tags            - tags like the one given with newgui.m/guiinitA()
        stacksize       - Size of the Stack for the guitask, if you don`t
                          know about it, set the standart-stack-size, this
                          is normally enaugh! (Standart = NG_STACK_SIZE or
                          4096!)

RETURN:

        info            - PTR to a guitaskinfo-structure

BUGS:

        In Version 3.1beta there is a bug in the Tag NG_FONT_NAME and
        NG_FONT_SIZE, which could hang the system if they are used with
        the ng_guitask.m-Module!

        General: If you use the NewGUI`s hooks (procedures) to use own
        functions within the NewGUI-Task, than you are not allowed to
        use Functions from the dos.library (like Open(), Close(), Read(),
        Write()...) because NewGUI runs in a Task and NOT in a Process,
        this isn`t a really bug but a restriction from the AmigaOS!


ng_endtask()

SYNTAX:

        ng_endtask(info)

FUNCTION:

        Kills the gui-task and free all allocated memory belonging to the
        gui-task (allocated by NewGUI!!!).

PARAMETERS:

        info            - PTR to the guitaskinfo-structure initialized by
                          ng_newtask()

RETURN:

        None

BUGS:

        None known


ng_checkgui()

SYNTAX:

        quit:=ng_checkgui(info)

FUNCTION:

        Checks if the guitask want to be killed / is finished (the user
        had finished the gui). This function doesn`t wait until a signal
        arrives, it does only a check! If you want to wait for the signal
        do a >Wait(info.sig)<!
        A call to this function is also allowed from a procedure inside
        the NewGUI-Task, but i thing you wouldn`t need it anyway!

PARAMETERS:

        info            - PTR TO the guitaskinfo-structure initialized by
                          ng_newtask()

RETURN:

        quit            - is TRUE if the guitask is finished and ready to
                          kill him, or FALSE if the gui is actually running!

BUGS:

        None known
