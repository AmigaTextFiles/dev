Ok, as far as I know, there is no more version 2.5, but a FUTURE 3.0 which is
not yet released. I can say that, because Wouter dos send me the doc 3.0 for 
the french translation... Or he forget it !

About the french translation, I've now to tranlate, something about 50 Ko of

Hi all

Well, Barry, I try what you said with the gadgetdata form the IntuiSup.library.
Hey, that works fine ! My program looks very nice now ! and most of all,
I discover that this library, under WB 1.3 allows you to access to the all
capabilities of the system 2.0... (locale, 3D look, all 2.0 gadgets)

If someone want to know more about This library, mail me or in the ML. I'll
send a doc, made by myself....

>> How do you print in other fonts in an intuition window???
I got this to work thanks to somebody's source posted on here the
other day.  I'll answer these questions anyway for other people who
might be having trouble.


>What function are you using to 'print'?
TextF

>Did you open the window with OpenW() or with OpenWindowTagList() ?
>If the second choice then set stdrast to the window's rport.
I used OpenW()

The problem was my textfont structure it seems.
Originally I had something like (Don't take this literally, it is just
out of my head)
myfont := ['times.font',18,0,1]
or something similar.  This didn't work for some reason.
By unscrupulously copying that other guy's source :^) I changed to
something along the lines of
myfont.name := 'times.font'
myfont.ysize := 18
etc. etc.
that's what made it work.

I've been working on a series of small useless programs such as
a starfield, a bouncing line, and the piece de resistance, the
Magic 8 Ball toy simulator :^), I will post them sometime in the
near future, for beginners to look at.

Have fun
Alan

Subject: Requesters (Requestors?)

Hello All!
This question is not really E specific and it probably is an Amiga
programmer FAQ but since there are so many bright people out there, I
thought this would be a great place to start...:-)

My confusion comes from reading the Libraries manual (3rd ed.) as concerns
requesters. It seems if you want to open one, you have three possibilities:

1. Fill out a requester structure/record/object-list. Good for pre-version
36 operating system. I do not want to do this because you cannot use
gadtools gadgets in such a requester.

2. Use the Easy request or auto-request function. This is good for simple
yes-no type requesters which have perhaps a couple of lines of explanation
but are really quite limited.

3. Here is where I'm not too sure what's going on: open a sub-window which
might be more along the lines of what I want to do. This sub-window could
have many gadgets in it, use gadtools and allow the user to move it
around the screen. The manual makes reference to the main window's IDCMP
port as if somehow the two windows can share the same port. How is that done?
I have also seen programs such as excellence! the word-processor where
requesters which open do not block input to the main window but rather
function as if they were separate programs (threads?) Are these requesters
actually mini-windows with their own IDCMP port? How could you handle
something like that in your program?

I know that an add-on library like Reqtools would do the job quite well but
before going that route, I'd like to try the system-provided routines. Any
help is of course greatly appreciated. :-)

Is there a way of 'randomizing' the output of the standard random number
generator in E. If there is, what is it?

Thanks in advance

That error is a IFFERR_READ, which is a stream read error. Maybe you could try
it on another file.

Subject: Problem child program

I am waiting to be added to the mailing list, but I have a problem that
is driving me up the wall.  Included here is a program fragment I've been
working on, which has tons of Enforcer hits, and I can't figure out why.

Also, it seems that AZ becomes very unstable when Enforcer is running, 
causing lots of hits. 

If it helps:

My system: Amiga 2000, 33 MHz Zeus 040 accel w/ 12 Megs 32 bit RAM,
Quantum LP52S hd, and Syquest 44.  I run 2.04 WB/KS.  If you have any clue
about the cause, please mail me back.  I like the E language, but this simple
example is driving me nuts!

Subject: ADMIN: AmigaE list delays

I'm sure that some of you have noticed a break in the
flow of list mail from AmigaE over the last few days. Our
feed system changed their setup over the weekend, and in 
the process broke our up-til-now very reliable connection.
We have finally resolved this problem, and mail will once
again be flowing freely beginning in the evening of 
Thursday, Feb. 3, 1994. 

If, after a couple of days, you feel that mail you sent 
has not appeared on the list, please resend it. It is 
possible, though not likely, that some mail was lost while
we wrestled with software configurations.

Sorry for any inconvenience these delays may have caused.

Norm.

	Hmm, strange.. Yeah, I haven't touched said program myself in
quite a few days, having just gotten ahold of Dune II and 1869. heh.

	Drag selecting, yah, I've been thinking of that myself, and the
only solution I have is this: There is no intuition way to do it. You can
try IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE reports, and get it to REPORTMOUSE, and this works,
but only when the mouse is moving. I want mine to start scrolling the list
(and selecting as it goes), if you hold down the mouse button and drag it
off the window. I can see no system friendly way to do this, so I might
have to add it to Dirj's input handler.

	Ok, this is a bit tricky, but is quite doable. My details may be a
bit off, because I don't have the RKMs with me, but here's the gist.
First, to avoid having devices you don't like, use the Dos (I believe)
call, IsFileSystem().
	To get the volume of the currently selected dir, somewhere in the
directory structure there's a pointer to a DiskInfo structure (or
something similar). This contains the volume node name and the size. So
this way, if you have an assign of c:, and it was actually dh0:c, you
could track down that c: was actually on dh0:, and dh0: has x bytes left.
I'll do a little write up on this when I get home and post it next time I
get on this stupid Mac to check my mail. Oh, for a remote account.

	Dontcha just hate it when your computer is possessed?

It does say in the docs that they control their own stack...

	Well, I'm writing it, and I'm not even close to done. (Of course,
this Dune II and 1869 thing hasn't helped.) Expect it on aminet in a
MINIMUM of 4 months. H2E might be up sooner, say within a month.

	I have found that IFFParse doesn't work as advertised on my 1200.
I copied the example instruction for instruction from the RKM, but, still
doesn't work. But, the most common 'error' that iffparse returns is the end of file 'error.'
This might be what you're thinking. Use Showmodule on iffparse.m to see
what -5 stands for.

Subject: STOP PRESS!!!


Amiga E has a double page feature in Amiga Shopper this month, March 
issue, pages 62/63.

Here are the contents of the "Checkout" box at the end of the article.

----8<----8<----8<----

FEATURES
Everything but OOP, FPU and 020+ processor support, but that's all coming 
in the next version.
9/10

DOCUMENTATION
A tutorial, reference manual and loads of really good, useful examples. 
However, the tutorial is a bit short, and the reference manual is a bit 
too terse in places.
7/10

EASE OF USE
A lot of the features are geared towards readability and ease of use. 
However, the error reports from syntax checking could be more helpful and 
at present you need to use an assembly level debugger to debug your code.
8/10

VALUE FOR MONEY
A complete, powerful language for the price of a floppy disk. Excellent 
value.
10/10

OVERALL RATING
The bad points are completely outweighed by the good points.
10/10

----8<----8<----8<----

Jason? :-)

Hi All,

  Just a quick question. How do you get windows and cons to
open up on a screen that is opened with OpenS().

  Haven't had a chance to really look at the ref docs yet, maybe
the answer is there, but if anybody could show me how I would be
grateful.

  Thanks in advance

Subject: Disk info (as requested)


	Rob Nottage asked for help on this, so here's the writeup on how to
get volume names, sizes, etc... (Modified for beginners as well, as I know
you aren't, Rob.)

	Ok, first of all, to figure out whether a device is useable in a
dir utility, use the function IsFileSystem(name). So
	IF IsFileSystem('PAR:')
		...
	ENDIF
	The other thing you need to know about is the InfoData structure,
and the Info() command. InfoData is the following and must be longword
aligned. (Which I'm sure is probably taken care of in E, if you allocate it
in your DEF.)

OBJECT InfoData
	numsofterrors:LONG
	unitnumber:LONG
	diskstate:LONG
	numblocks:LONG		/* So, these three are how you */
	numblocksused:LONG	/* Compute size remaining, of course. */
	bytesperblock:LONG
	disktype:LONG
	volumenode:LONG		/*<- This is a BCPL pointer to a node */
	inuse:LONG		/* So, to use it as an E ptr, you must */
ENDOBJECT			/* ptr:=Shl(ptr,2) (I believe.) */


	To get this structure, use the Dos call Info(lock,infodata). Where
lock is a BCPL pointer to a lock (obtained from Open or Lock), and infodata
is a pointer to an allocated InfoData structure. This way you can use any
open file to obtain the volume information.
	That should pretty much do it. If example code is needed, I'll be
happy to post it.

Subject: Pointing to gadget



I am writing a program where I wanted my string gadget to be automatically
activated. So, I used the ActivateGadget() routine. I can't get
ActivateGadget() to activate my string gadget. I created the interface to
my program using GadToolsBox and SrcGen.
        
Here's what I'm doing:
        
        PROC openrequeststringwindow()
          DEF g:PTR TO gadget
          IF (g:=CreateContext({requeststringglist}))=NIL THEN RETURN NOCONTEXT
          IF (g:=CreateGadgetA(STRING_KIND,g,
            [offx+65,offy+41,326,14,'_String',tattr,0,1,visual,0]:newgadget,
            [GTST_MAXCHARS,256,
             GT_UNDERSCORE,"_",
             NIL]))=NIL THEN RETURN NOGADGET
          IF (g:=CreateGadgetA(BUTTON_KIND,g,
            [offx+9,offy+61,94,14,'_Ok',tattr,1,16,visual,0]:newgadget,
            [GT_UNDERSCORE,"_",
             NIL]))=NIL THEN RETURN NOGADGET
          IF (g:=CreateGadgetA(BUTTON_KIND,g,
            [offx+296,offy+61,94,14,'_Cancel',tattr,2,16,visual,0]:newgadget,
            [GT_UNDERSCORE,"_",
             NIL]))=NIL THEN RETURN NOGADGET
          IF (g:=CreateGadgetA(TEXT_KIND,g,
            [offx+9,offy+13,382,25,'',tattr,3,0,visual,0]:newgadget,
            [GTTX_TEXT,bodytxt,
             GTTX_COPYTEXT,1,
             GTTX_BORDER,1,
             NIL]))=NIL THEN RETURN NOGADGET
        
        [...]
        
        ActivateGadget(g.gadgetid.0,requeststringwnd,NIL)
        
        
I can't get the program to compile when I have this in. My string gadget is 
gadgetid 0.
        
Should I use this kind of DEF instead?
        
DEF pointer PTR TO gadget, gadgetid

I myself would be totally happy with something that converted .h files to

using E, but the thought of somehow making a .m file that EC will understand
has stopped me so far. ;-)

Is there any way right now to type in an equivalent OBJECT to the C structure
and then convert that ASCII file to a .m module? Otherwise it becomes a bit
of a pain to use E, since I learn best through hacking with sample code, and
all the sample code for this stuff is in C.

    Here's a solution: Get ALL Devices, and then check all VOLUMES ONLY.  A
Device which has a filesystems IS GOING TO HAVE a VOLUME NAME.  Just do a
little cross-checking and baddabing, baddaboom :-)

Subject: Amiga Shopper article.


Dear All,

At long last my article about Amiga E has been published in Amiga Shopper (a
UK serious magazine).  If anyone's interested it's in Issue 35 (March 1994)
on pages 62-63.  I haven't had time to look at it in detail, yet, but it
seems like all the bad puns have been left in!  The references to 2.5 show
the age of the article...

Subject: Mac2E for 1.3 users

	Hi everybody,

	Mac2E v3.0 is finished, and I'm now working on the docs. It is far more
better (faster above all) then the 2.0 one. But I will tell you its new features
when I'll put it on aminet (next week I hope).
	For the moment, my problem is that Mac2E still needs Workbench 2.0+ to
run. So, I ask myself if someone is interested by a 1.3 version. If it is, let
me know ! It's useless to do a program if nobody (even you !) uses it :-) I
point out that the Mac2E v3.0 is FASSSSSSSSSSTER than the Mac2E v2.0. So I
think that any Amiga user (even with a 68000 inside) can afford the extra time
needed to use it. To be more precise, in the worst cases, Mac2E v3.0 doubles
the compilation time.
	I've already think about a 1.3 version. My problem is to emulate the
ReadArgs() function. To do this, I thought to use the arp.library. So I got
it from aminet yesterday. But when I extrated the docs, I found out that the
aminet version is only for 2.0 Kickstart, ARGGGGGGGGGG :-( But I'm sure that
the versions above 39 are for 1.3 kickstart. So, is any of you knows where I can
find v39 arp.library ? Perhaps, somebody owns it ! Third solution : is any of
you successed in making a ReadArgs() emulation for 1.3 ?

	Thanks for your answers, Lionel

Subject: I`m new here!

Hello, I`ve just joined this mailing list and I`m a little out of touch with
everything that`s going on. I got the postings on Aminet for the old lists,
but since then... :)

Anyway, I`m wondering about a couple of things:

1: E has some darn useful functions missing...
   Has anyone managed to use GT_SetGadgetAttrs in gadtools? Cuz it AIN`T THERE!
   And ParsePatternNoCase() in DOS? SAME AGAIN! (bitch when writing a file
   finder... like I WAS... :)
   Not to mention DoMethod() in amiga.lib... I tried disassembling this but
   I don`t know too much about how the C stubs work, so I got lost... :(
   Anyway, any help in getting around these problems would be appreciated...
2: I have had some joy with MUI, I got a basic window with some text up
   and running, but nothing else... no DoMethod()! Gah!
   Anyway, if anyone wants any help with gadtools or similar stuff please
   mail me direct, as I have quite a bit of expereince with such things.
   And I managed to get a font-sensitive new-look BlackOnWhite(tm) menu-ed
   Scalable-MXbutton window running... WITHOUT using GadToolsBox!
   Any use to anyone?

Finally, has anyone got any tips for reading tooltypes? My efforts crash the
system, but I don`t have the source at hand :(

And this month`s Amiga Shopper has a 2-page spread on E! Plus the address
for this mailing list... Prepared to be swamped by requests asking how to
access the CLI to compile E code! :) "What is ED?" ... "Hello World" in E...

Well i played around with it some more and discovered that my original
way was ok, if I would just put ':textattr', after the closing ']'
Learn something new every day...

Have fun

I suggest, Charles, that you take a gander at Dave Higginson's
mweg.e example, which can be obtained from aminet, 
dev/e/AmigaE.BinArc.lha.  It's a very small and easy to read
demo of opening multiple windows, waiting on multiple ports, 
and acting on the messages coming from Intuition...exactly 
what you're looking for.  If anyone has not seen this source, 
get it.  NOW.  It's one o' them valuable E gems, rare and 
indispensible. :-)

-- Barry

P.S. - While I got your attention, remember waaaay back, I 
expressed some interest about an article you wrote on E?  If 
you still have the electronic version I'd really appreciate 
it if you emailed it to me. =)

That kind old soul Barry has finally solved my LISTVIEW blues with an
example bit of code. Rather than clog up the list with huuuuge uuencoded
blocks and double mailings, anyone who wants a copy is welcome to it. Just
fling me a mail and I'll do the rest ...

I've just started using the iffparse.library.
and I'm getting a problem when I parse an IFF file.
ParseIFF() returns an error (-5). Anyone encounter this problem?

fling me a mail and I'll do the rest ...

Subject: IntuiSup.library

hai all,

Here it is : the missing doc about IntuiSup. I write from my own experiences
and with help from some of you :)

It is not a real doc, but a kind of How to use' for beginners like me !

Good reading !

IntuiSup.library                                               IntuiSup.library


                            The missing DOC


Note : this file is *NOT* a part of the IntuiSup archive. I write it only
because there are some other users who will ask them a lot of question about
using this library, and may be are as I am, a beginner in programmation.
There are some things that I don't know about this library. So don't ask me
what does one function do. It is only a summary with some comments.
the (?) means that I don't know what exactly does this function. I don't try
it yet !
This file is more a 'How to use' and 'whre to find that' file than a
technical one, where I can read nothing. All what you will read comes
directly from my own experience. There is no Doc, except a brief description
of the command.

All of this can be found in the example file semed in the archive...



I       What is the IntuiSup.library ?

        It is a gadget library compatible with all Amigas system from 1.3
    up to 3.0. It is written by Torsten Jürgenleit.
    The library can be found on Aminet sites, in the 'utils/libs' directory.


II      What does this library do more than the others ?

        Well, for 2.0+ system user, this library is only usefull in the way of
    how you program it in your code.
    For 1.3 system users, like me, it is a open door to the 2.0 system without
    having it !
    Here are the features that IntuiSup allows :

        - 3D look,
        - all 2.0 gadgets,
        - locale available under 1.3 !
        - and a Editor, but unfortunately, it produces C codes :(


III     How to link IntuiSup with Amiga E ? What about the E modules ?

        This is a critical point. The only way for E user to use an shared
    library, is to convert the pragmas and the include files into E modules.

    Pragmas : you can find the pragmas file called 'IntuiSup.h'
            Beware, there is many 'IntuiSup.h' files in the archive.
            Then use the Pragmas2module program to convert it. Place the
            resulting 'IntuiSup.m' in the EMODULES: directory.

    Include : There is no IntuiSup.i file in the package. The only way to do
            is to convert the include 'IntuiSup.h' (not the same as the
            Pragmas one) with a C processor into 'IntuiSup.i'. And then
            convert this latter file with Iconvert (which need the SAS/C
            Includes and A68k). Place the result in the 'EMODULES:Libraries/'
            directory.

    That's it for the modules !

    Note 1 : I translated these files in E modules, but modified some constants
        (They are very very long : some are 25 chars long !)

    Note 2 : In the Include file, you will find a structure for the gadgets
        with a C union within. Just erase this structure, we don't use it
        as far as we will use E lists and the GadgetData structure.


IV      Is there something special in the use of IntuiSup ?

        Yes, it is the internal variable, which is used in fast all the
    fonctions. This is the only way to the library to know where it is !
    This is because the IntuiSup modify all Intuition messages by adding
    its own. So it is not very painful to add this library in your code,
    because all message will be send through intuition. The only minor
    difference is to replace the functions GetMsg() and ReplyMsg() with
    IGetMsg() and IReply(). That's all !
    For the lists and structures, lists must be 0-terminated.
    (INTUISUP_DATA_END = 0)


V       About the gadgets, how do we code them ?

        Simple, we will use lists to create our gadget.
    The way to do it is :

    DEF gadgets

    gadgets:=[ type,flags,x,y,w,h,text,textattr,data1,data2,data3,
               type,flags,x,y,w,h,text,textattr,data1,data2,data3,
               .......
                  0,    0,0,0,0,0,   0,       0,    0,    0,    0 ]:gadgetdata


    Note that you must have at least in the 'emodules:libraries/intuisup.m'
    module the gadgetdata structure. The union can be deleted. This is the
    object equivalent to the C structure we must have :

        OBJECT GadgetData [
            gd_Types,
            gd_Flags,
            gd_LeftEdge,
            gd_Width,
            gd_Height,
            gd_Text,
            gd_TextAttr : textattr
            gd_Data1,
            gd_Data2,
            gd_Data3 ]

    You will notice that the string gadget need a 4th Data. You can add this
    one in this 'onject' before compiling the module, but don't forget to add
    a 4th NIL data in ALL gadgets...

    Entries :
            Note that these entries are definied as constant.

        type : one of the ten gadgets (1..11)
                 1 = Button
                 2 = Check
                 3 = Mutual Exclude (mx)
                 4 = String
                 5 = Integer
                 6 = Slider
                 7 = Scroller
                 8 = Cycle
                 9 = Count
                10 = ListView
                11 = Palette

        flags : 13 flags are available
                1    = gadget disabled (ghosted)
                2    = no border
                4    = High Comp (?)
                8    = vertical orientation
                16   = Hot Key
                32   = No text Output
                64   = Text is displayed on the left  side of the gadget
                128  = ----------------- ------ right ------- ----------
                512  = -----------------        above         ----------
                1024 = -----------------        under         ----------
                2048 = Button toggle
                4096 = Button image
        x,y,w,h : coordinates of the gadget
        text : a pointer to a string or a dynamic string
        textattr : pointer to the TextAttributes strutures or a list

        datas :
            here are the meaning of the 3 (or 4) datas for each kind of
            gadgets :

            Button :
                data 1 : button state : 0 = not selected, 1 = selected
                data 2 : button image (not selected)
                data 3 : button image (when selected)
            Check :
                data 1 : check state : 0 = not selected, 1 = selected
                data 2 : check pad1 (?)
                data 3 : check pad2 (?)
            Mutual exclude (MX) :
                data 1 : # of pixel sepring 2 radio gadgets
                data 2 : num of the active entry
                data 3 : pointer to a text array or a 0-terminated list
            String :
                data 1 : length of the input
                data 2 : offset of the next string gadget to be activated
                data 3 : offset of the previous string gadget to be activated
                data 4 : default text that is displayed
            Integer :
                Same as String
            Slider :
                data 1 : minimum level
                data 2 : maximum level
                data 3 : current position
            Scroller :
                data 1 : # of visible entries
                data 2 : # of total entries
                data 3 : cuurent entry (the top one)
            Cycle :
                data 1 : # of pixel separing pop up cycle (?)
                data 2 : # of current cycle text pointer text array (?)
                data 3 : pointer to cycle text pointer array (?)
            Count :
                data 1 : minimum value
                data 2 : maximum value
                data 3 : current default value
            ListView :
                data 1 : # of pixel separating 2 entries
                data 2 : current entry (the top one)
                data 3 : pointer to a List structure
            Palette :
                data 1 : # of bitplanes to be displayed
                data 2 : first color in the palette (?)
                data 3 : selected color


    Example :

        DEF gadget,internalvar,txtattr,gadgetlist

        internamvar:=IgetRenderInfos(screen,RENDERINFOSFLAGS)
        txtattr:=['topaz',8,0,0] : textattr
        gad:=[  1,   0, 10, 15,120, 13,'Archiver',txtattr,0,0,0,
                3,     1,530,167,120, 13,'Suffix',txtattr,0,0,['Always',
                                                                      'Never',
                                                                      NIL],
                1,     0,370, 15,120, 13,'Debug' ,txtattr,0,0,0,
                0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 ] : gadgetdata

        gadgetlist:=IcreateGadgets(internalvar,gad,0,0,NIL)

    Note that you can't pass this gadgetlist in the declaration of a window..
    To display the gadget, you must call the IdisplayGadgets(window,gadgetlist)
    function.
    The same is to remove a list of gadget from a window, you must call the
    IremoveGadgets(gadgetlist) and then, if you don't want to use anymore
    this list, call IfreeGadgetList(gadgetlist).


VI      Are there other structure ?

        Yes :
    the BorderData, which allows yu to draw 3D border
    the TextData , which allows to pass text and text flags to some functions
    NOte that it is possible to make an E list of any number of Data, in the
    form of the GadgetData above.


VII     And about requesters ?

        Sorry, but I prefer to use the great ReqTools.library
    However, requester and auto resquet can be made. There is no file
    requester :(
    The structure is called 'RequesterData' :

        OBJECT RequestData [
            rd_LeftEdge,
            rd_TopEdge,
            rd_Width,
            rd_Height,
            rd_Flags,
            rd_Title,
            rd_Texts : TextAttr
            rd_Borders : BorderData
            rd_Gadgets : GadgetData ]


VIII    Do you try then menus ?

        No, not yet. May be sooner as I'm thinking :)
        The structure is named 'MenuData' :

            OBJECT MenuData [
                md_Type,
                md_Flags,
                md_Name,
                md_CommandKey,
                md_MutualExclude ]


Conclusion :

        Well this is folks ! I hope that you will enjoy using this library.
    I think more particularly to 1.3 system users like me. If some one else
    is making a 'How to use' file; pease mail it me before end of July 94
    (I'm returning to France, yes I'm French, studying in Germany !)

[Sorry if this has made it once already, but the list has been playing up...]

My Amiga Shopper article has made it to press!  It's in Issue 35 (March 1994)
on pages 62-63.  There's been a small amount of editing done, but all the
bad puns still seem to be there.  The article was submitted about 6 months
ago so it's a little out of date.  In particular it refers to the forth-coming
E version 2.5 (which should now be 3.0 of course).

For the uninitiated: Amiga Shopper is a UK magazine which does not review any
games, just the serious stuff.  I think it's available (mail order) around
the world (there was a recent comp.sys.amiga.review, and I think the author
was Australian).

I'd like to post the review here, but I've only got the unedited version and
I'm not sure where I'd stand on Copyright... [It's not that good, anyway!]

Subject: IntuiSup doc2

Hi all,

well, I repost the doc I wrote about the IntuiSup.library

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

IntuiSup.library                                               IntuiSup.library


                            The missing DOC


Note : this file is *NOT* a part of the IntuiSup archive. I write it only
because there are some other users who will ask them a lot of question about
using this library, and may be are as I am, a beginner in programmation.
There are some things that I don't know about this library. So don't ask me
what does one function do. It is only a summary with some comments.
the (?) means that I don't know what exactly does this function. I don't try
it yet !
This file is more a 'How to use' and 'whre to find that' file than a
technical one, where I can read nothing. All what you will read comes
directly from my own experience. There is no Doc, except a brief description
of the command.

All of this can be found in the example file semed in the archive...



I       What is the IntuiSup.library ?

        It is a gadget library compatible with all Amigas system from 1.3
    up to 3.0. It is written by Torsten Jürgenleit.
    The library can be found on Aminet sites, in the 'utils/libs' directory.


II      What does this library do more than the others ?

        Well, for 2.0+ system user, this library is only usefull in the way of
    how you program it in your code.
    For 1.3 system users, like me, it is a open door to the 2.0 system without
    having it !
    Here are the features that IntuiSup allows :

        - 3D look,
        - all 2.0 gadgets,
        - locale available under 1.3 !
        - and a Editor, but unfortunately, it produces C codes :(


III     How to link IntuiSup with Amiga E ? What about the E modules ?

        This is a critical point. The only way for E user to use an shared
    library, is to convert the pragmas and the include files into E modules.

    Pragmas : you can find the pragmas file called 'IntuiSup.h'
            Beware, there is many 'IntuiSup.h' files in the archive.
            Then use the Pragmas2module program to convert it. Place the
            resulting 'IntuiSup.m' in the EMODULES: directory.

    Include : There is no IntuiSup.i file in the package. The only way to do
            is to convert the include 'IntuiSup.h' (not the same as the
            Pragmas one) with a C processor into 'IntuiSup.i'. And then
            convert this latter file with Iconvert (which need the SAS/C
            Includes and A68k). Place the result in the 'EMODULES:Libraries/'
            directory.

    That's it for the modules !

    Note 1 : I translated these files in E modules, but modified some constants
        (They are very very long : some are 25 chars long !)

    Note 2 : In the Include file, you will find a structure for the gadgets
        with a C union within. Just erase this structure, we don't use it
        as far as we will use E lists and the GadgetData structure.


IV      Is there something special in the use of IntuiSup ?

        Yes, it is the internal variable, which is used in fast all the
    fonctions. This is the only way to the library to know where it is !
    This is because the IntuiSup modify all Intuition messages by adding
    its own. So it is not very painful to add this library in your code,
    because all message will be send through intuition. The only minor
    difference is to replace the functions GetMsg() and ReplyMsg() with
    IGetMsg() and IReply(). That's all !
    For the lists and structures, lists must be 0-terminated.
    (INTUISUP_DATA_END = 0)


V       About the gadgets, how do we code them ?

        Simple, we will use lists to create our gadget.
    The way to do it is :

    DEF gadgets

    gadgets:=[ type,flags,x,y,w,h,text,textattr,data1,data2,data3,
               type,flags,x,y,w,h,text,textattr,data1,data2,data3,
               .......
                  0,    0,0,0,0,0,   0,       0,    0,    0,    0 ]:gadgetdata


    Note that you must have at least in the 'emodules:libraries/intuisup.m'
    module the gadgetdata structure. The union can be deleted. This is the
    object equivalent to the C structure we must have :

        OBJECT GadgetData [
            gd_Types,
            gd_Flags,
            gd_LeftEdge,
            gd_Width,
            gd_Height,
            gd_Text,
            gd_TextAttr : textattr
            gd_Data1,
            gd_Data2,
            gd_Data3 ]

    You will notice that the string gadget need a 4th Data. You can add this
    one in this 'onject' before compiling the module, but don't forget to add
    a 4th NIL data in ALL gadgets...

    Entries :
            Note that these entries are definied as constant.

        type : one of the ten gadgets (1..11)
                 1 = Button
                 2 = Check
                 3 = Mutual Exclude (mx)
                 4 = String
                 5 = Integer
                 6 = Slider
                 7 = Scroller
                 8 = Cycle
                 9 = Count
                10 = ListView
                11 = Palette

        flags : 13 flags are available
                1    = gadget disabled (ghosted)
                2    = no border
                4    = Highlight with Complement colours
                8    = vertical orientation
                16   = Hot Key
                32   = No text Output
                64   = Text is displayed on the left  side of the gadget
                128  = ----------------- ------ right ------- ----------
                512  = -----------------        above         ----------
                1024 = -----------------        under         ----------
                2048 = Button toggle
                4096 = Button image
        x,y,w,h : coordinates of the gadget
        text : a pointer to a string or a dynamic string
        textattr : pointer to the TextAttributes strutures or a list

        datas :
            here are the meaning of the 3 (or 4) datas for each kind of
            gadgets :

            Button :
                data 1 : button state : 0 = not selected, 1 = selected
                data 2 : button image (not selected)
                data 3 : button image (when selected)
            Check :
                data 1 : check state : 0 = not selected, 1 = selected
                data 2 : check pad1 (?)
                data 3 : check pad2 (?)
            Mutual exclude (MX) :
                data 1 : # of pixel sepring 2 radio gadgets
                data 2 : num of the active entry
                data 3 : pointer to a text array or a 0-terminated list
            String :
                data 1 : length of the input
                data 2 : offset of the next string gadget to be activated
                data 3 : offset of the previous string gadget to be activated
                data 4 : default text that is displayed
            Integer :
                Same as String
            Slider :
                data 1 : minimum level
                data 2 : maximum level
                data 3 : current position
            Scroller :
                data 1 : # of visible entries
                data 2 : # of total entries
                data 3 : cuurent entry (the top one)
            Cycle :
                data 1 : # of pixel separing pop up cycle (?)
                data 2 : # of current cycle text pointer text array (?)
                data 3 : pointer to cycle text pointer array (?)
            Count :
                data 1 : minimum value
                data 2 : maximum value
                data 3 : current default value
            ListView :
                data 1 : # of pixel separating 2 entries
                data 2 : current entry (the top one)
                data 3 : pointer to a List structure
            Palette :
                data 1 : # of bitplanes to be displayed
                data 2 : first color in the palette (?)
                data 3 : selected color


    Example :

        DEF gadget,internalvar,txtattr,gadgetlist

        internamvar:=IgetRenderInfos(screen,RENDERINFOSFLAGS)
        txtattr:=['topaz',8,0,0] : textattr
        gad:=[  1,   0, 10, 15,120, 13,'Archiver',txtattr,0,0,0,
                3,     1,530,167,120, 13,'Suffix',txtattr,0,0,['Always',
                                                                      'Never',
                                                                      NIL],
                1,     0,370, 15,120, 13,'Debug' ,txtattr,0,0,0,
                0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 ] : gadgetdata

        gadgetlist:=IcreateGadgets(internalvar,gad,0,0,NIL)

    Note that you can't pass this gadgetlist in the declaration of a window..
    To display the gadget, you must call the IdisplayGadgets(window,gadgetlist)
    function.
    The same is to remove a list of gadget from a window, you must call the
    IremoveGadgets(gadgetlist) and then, if you don't want to use anymore
    this list, call IfreeGadgetList(gadgetlist).


VI      Are there other structure ?

        Yes :
    the BorderData, which allows yu to draw 3D border
    the TextData , which allows to pass text and text flags to some functions
    NOte that it is possible to make an E list of any number of Data, in the
    form of the GadgetData above.


VII     And about requesters ?

        Sorry, but I prefer to use the great ReqTools.library
    However, requester and auto resquet can be made. There is no file
    requester :(
    The structure is called 'RequesterData' :

        OBJECT RequestData [
            rd_LeftEdge,
            rd_TopEdge,
            rd_Width,
            rd_Height,
            rd_Flags,
            rd_Title,
            rd_Texts : TextAttr
            rd_Borders : BorderData
            rd_Gadgets : GadgetData ]


VIII    Do you try then menus ?

        No, not yet. May be sooner as I'm thinking :)
        The structure is named 'MenuData' :

            OBJECT MenuData [
                md_Type,
                md_Flags,
                md_Name,
                md_CommandKey,
                md_MutualExclude ]


Conclusion :

        Well this is folks ! I hope that you will enjoy using this library.
    I think more particularly to 1.3 system users like me. If some one else
    is making a 'How to use' file; pease mail it me before end of July 94
    (I'm returning to France, yes I'm French, studying in Germany !)

Subject: ARRAY OF OBJECT

Hi all,

I use the filerequest of the ReqTools.library. Having the MULTISELECT tag set
to ON. I want to save the list of the files wich is in the rtfilelist structure

I try to make a object with 2 string item in it. That's work fine. But it is
only for one file... (path and name). How could I make an array of this object
I try to declare my array as an ARRAY OF myobject. I always have a GURU.

Here is an example, I don't know if this runs (it is a 'souvenir'), but you
will quickly understand, what I mean :)

	OBJECT myobject
		path : LONG,
		NAME : LONG
	ENDOBJECT

	DEF myarray[10] : ARRAY OF LONG

	PROC main()
		path:=String(20)
		name:=String(30)
	/* etc... */
	ENDPROC
Does anybody have a suggestion ? or have another way to do it.

Note : I want to make with this list a list View...

Thanx, bye !

By popular demand, or so it seems...

Gadtools ListView Example.  This isn't intuisup, Olivier,
but I would imagine you could apply the same concepts.

UUencoded since it's _just_ over 200 lines.

Hmm, O.k. I'll check it out. I'll post another msg with the routine that

Is there any special things I should be looking for when I

(-5) is a stream read error...

I wonder if the problem isn't because the iff_stream portion of the
structure isn't being initialized properly in the RKM example.

I'm currently doing something like this...

Open (file,...
PutLong (iff.stream,file)

/* set up my propchunks here */

err:=ParseIFF(iff)

IF err<>0 THEN boom(err)

etc...

As I said, I'll post the code later.

Is it just my machine or is anyone having trouble compiling this? It keeps

I don't know what the problem is, certainly the code before that references
all the modules properly. Barry, anyone?

	Ok, I have tried that. But, before I waste your time with my code,
I'll load the code with debug statements pointing to the error. (It's
quite obvious where the memory is dissapearing when you load it with
enough debug code.)

	No doubt. (I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy!)

Subject: Strings and Numbers and Things......Oh My!!

Hi It's me again,

  I know in the Ref docs it tells how to change a string representation
of a number to a number, but can you change a string rep. of a hex number
into a hex number. 

  Also I haven't been able to find any mention of how to raise a number
to a power.

  The reason for the questions is that in the game I'm working on, I'm
breaking the map down into a 16 x 16 grid with the lines to the grid
representing where the vertical and horizontal walls would be.

  With this scheme, I can represent all of the information for the vertical
and horizontal walls with two different sets of 17 numbers. The same scheme
will be used for the location of doors as well.

  I could use decimal instead of hex but I'm trying to keep my eventual
data files as small as possible. Also being able to raise 2 to the diff
powers would cut down on the code some.

  I don't have a lot done yet but if anyone's interested i could send them
what I have so you could kinda see what I'm trying to do and maybe offer
some suggestions on how to do some things better.

later

Subject: HELP!!! (With AppIcons)

I'm working on an AppIcon project, and I've run into what I think may be a
bug in E.  I'm trying to read the appmessage.arglist[].name.  According to
the RKM, the .name part is there, and according to E, it is not.  Ok I can
handle that.  I look up the appmessage structure in 'workbench/workbench'
and it says that appmessage.arglist is a LONG.  So how the heck are you
supposed to read the names of the icons which are dropped on the AppIcon???
BTW - This is an attempted translation of the AppIcons prog on page 360 of
the Libaries RKM.  The code I have so far follows (so far this code can
detect when the AppIcon is double clicked, when objects are dropped on it,
and how many.  Now I just need to get the names of the icons which are
dropped on it!!

Thanks in advance for any help.

Gt_SetGadgetAttrs is a stack based function. E does not provide this sort 
of function call, so you must use Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA. Due to E's list 
handling facilities, the code ends up looking virtually the same anyway :

Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA(gad,win,NIL,[GA_DISABLED,TRUE,0]);
instead of
Gt_SetGadgetAttrs(gad,win,NIL,GA_DISABLED,TRUE,0)

Wouter sent code for a DoMethod to the list some time ago, I seem to 
remember. So, hunt through your archives for his message (I didn't save 
it at the time, unfortunately). I think it was either July or August.

If you have WB2+ and don't mind relying on your users to have this too, 
there are some functions in the Workbench or Icon library - can't 
remember which - that will do this for you.

Unfortunately the article was written before E changed to a listserv, so 
they have the wrong address anyway. I suspect this may turn out to be a 
headache for Norm more than anyone else :)

Subject: AppIcon.e

Yes!!! I did it.  I found that in order to read the names of the objects
dropped on an AppIcon you have to reference a wbarg structure at arglist
in the appmessage structure.  (Errrkkk!!)  Thanks to my friends includes I
figured this out.  So it wasn't a bug in E, but durn close.

Here's the completely functioning source for a 100% (not yet) usable AppIcon.

	I believe the RKMS say do NOT use ActivateGadget on Gadtools
gadgets. Could be wrong, but I know you are not supposed to use other
stuff like DisableGadget on it. Find the proper tag and pass it to it with
SetGadgetAttrsA().

	Well, yes, it's quite easy to convert C structures to E. Convert
them, then use the PMODULE directive with EPP. That's how H2E is going to
work. There really is no huge need to make them .m's.. They're a little
slower, but they still work.

Ho, Dave.

I suppose I should fix that egads.lha on aminet since
it's turning out to be a 9-headed hydra.  The problem
is with the object identifier DEF'ed as 'PTR TO textfont'.
Change it to "PTR TO tf" and all should be well.

Subject: 3.0 Wish List Addendum


	Well, just thought I'd add to this wishlist, though all of these
are relatively simple things that probably could have been added to 2.1b.
(I guess me and Wouter have different design philosophies.)

Wish List Addendum...
-No size/element limit on constant structures, lists, arrays.. E is a
dynamic language, why is there a limit on something so silly?
-Real keyword/constant checking! I want to be able to start my
functions/variables in uppercase if I so desire! (You wouldn't believe the
problems this is causi
ng with converting Angband to E!) Anything else is just cheaping out to
keep compiler speed. Come on!

	Well, everything else I can think of has already been suggested so
that's it. I hope this isn't too late for 3.0, or has already been
implemented!

MEGA WARNING !!!

NEVER USE IsFileSystem('DEVICE:') WHEN YOU HAVE LOCKED THE DOSLIST
FOR READING OR WRITING, BECAUSE YOU WILL GET A MEGA-DEADLOCK...

The reason is, that IsFileSystem(...) has to load every handler,
that is not already loaded to the system (eg. PRT:). The OS
then has to update the processport-information of the doslist
and tries to lock the doslist too, that is already locked by you. :)

well, I'll e-mail it to you tomorrow. Does anybody else want it ?

	I wrote a macro preprocessor for Amiga E with MUI macros as example.
It's called Mac2E. E-mail me for more details.

	I began a long time ago a program which needed tooltype reading. I gave
up this program (for the moment), but I can send to you the parts that you
are interested in. But the comments are in French !

Subject: Types!


Hello All,

Here is yet another text I wrote with the purpose to help people
understand E better. It's a first version, so needs improvement. Enjoy!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------



                         UNDERSTANDING E TYPES

                       by Wouter van Oortmerssen



Intro
-----

Most problems people have while programming in E stem from their incorrect
view of how the E type-system works, and, admitted, this is not surprising
given the way it is described in the reference manual. Also, many people
have an idea how types work from their previous programming language, and
try to apply this to E, which is often fatal, because E is quite different
when it come to types.


The Type System
---------------

This may come as a shock to some readers, but E is in essense a TYPELESS
language. Indeed, variables may have a type, but this is only used as a
specification how to dereference a variable when it is used as a pointer.
In almost ALL other language constructions, variables are treated as all
being of the same type, namely the famous 32bit typeless value.

In practise this means that for example in expressions with the exception
of the ".", "[]" and "++" operators etc., all operators and functions work
on 32bit values, regardless of wether they represent booleans, integers,
reals or pointers to something.


So what are those Pointer Types?
--------------------------------

In the E type-system only 4 types exist, PTR TO CHAR, PTR TO INT,
PTR TO LONG and PTR TO <object>, where <object> is a name of a previously
defined OBJECT. When a variable (or an object member, as we'll see later)
is declared as being of this type, It means that if the variable contains
a value that is a legal pointer, this is how it should be dereferenced.


And what about LONG, ARRAY etc. ?
---------------------------------

All other types one may see in a DEF declaration a not really types, as
they really are only other ways of writing one of the above four. As an
example, ARRAY OF <type> is just another way of writing PTR TO <type>, with
the only difference that the former is automatically assigned the address
of an area of stackspace which is big enough to hold data for the #of
elements specified in square brackets.

Here's a table that shows all E 'types' in terms of the basic four:

ARRAY OF CHAR, ARRAY, STRING, LONG, <>   (are equal to)   PTR TO CHAR
ARRAY OF INT                             (is equal to)    PTR TO INT
ARRAY OF LONG, LIST                      (are equal to)   PTR TO LONG
ARRAY OF <object>, <object>              (are equal to)   PTR TO <object>

with "<>" I mean: no type specification at all.

- LONG is for variables that are not intended to be used as a pointer,
  i.e integers. It's equivalence with PTR TO CHAR is quite logical, as
  conceptually both talk about things that are measured in units of 1.
  (for example, "++" has the same effect on both)
- LIST and STRING are the same as their ARRAY equivalents, in respect
  to the fact that they're initialised to a piece of stack-space, but
  they're stack representation is a little more complex to facilitate
  runtime bounds-checking (when used with the correct functions).
- an <object> is equivalent to [1]:ARRAY OF <object>. both represent
  an initialised PTR TO <object>.

In an OBJECT one can have the same declarations, with the addition of CHAR
and INT (similar to LONG), and the ommission of LIST and STRING, as these
are complex objects in their own right, and cannot be part of an object.
(NOTE: in versions of E previous to v3.0, PTR TO and ARRAY OF types were
not available in OBJECTS)


Deferencing
-----------

Given a pointer p of some type,

"[]" may index other elements that are sequentially ordered next to
     the element it is currently pointing to. note that this allows for
     both positive and negative indices, and also no assumptions are made
     about where and howmany elements are actually allocated.

"++" sets the pointer to the next element in memory, "--" to the previous
     one. note that these operators always operate on the pointer and
     never on the the element the pointer is pointing to.

"."  works similar to "[]", only now indexes the pointer by name, i.e. the
     pointer must be a PTR TO <object>.

"[]" and "." may be concatenated to a pointer p in any sequence, given the
fact that the previous resulting value again is known to be of a "PTR TO"
type. (note that in versions of E previous to v3.0, this was restricted to
one "[]" and then one ".", notably because OBJECTs couldn't have PTRs in
them)

One does not need to write out a de-reference in total, as in other
languages, e.g. if p is an ARRAY OF obj, instead of having to write
p[index].member you can write just p[index], which logically results
in in the address of that object. This also explains why p[].member
is equivalent to p.member, since p[] is the same as p when it points
to an object.


Reference Semantics
-------------------

Another type-related issue that makes E somewhat different from other
languages and thus harder to grasp is it's accent on Reference Semantics
rather than Value Semantics. I'll try to argue why that's good here.

Informally, Reference Semantics means that objects in a language (mostly
other than the simple ones like LONGs) are represented by pointers, while
Value Semantics treats these objects as just being themselves. An example
of a language that has only Value Semantics is BASIC, examples of
languages that have them both are the C/C++ and Pascal type-of languages,
and examples of Reference only are newer Object Oriented languages like
Eiffel, functional languages like LISP and ofcourse E.

Using Reference Semantics doesn't mean being occupied with pointers
all the time, rather you're worrying about them a lot less then in the
mixed case or the Value-only case, especially since in real life programs
most non-trivial data-structures get allocated dynamically which implies
pointers. The best example of this is LISP, where one programs heavily
with pointers without noticing. In E, one could easily forget STRING
is a pointer, given the easy by which one can pass it around to other
functions; in C often lots of "&" are needed where in the equivalent E
case non are, and the Oberon equivalent of bla('hallo') looks like
bla(sys.ADR('hallo')) because the string doesn't represent a pointer,
but a value as a whole...

So why do languages have Value Semantics? beats me. One may thinks it's
conceptually nice but I can't imagine. A stronger argument seems to be
that accesses to objects that are no pointers can be better optimised by
a good compiler, but since only very trivial and static data-structures
can be build in this fashion, it's hardly an issue. Value semantics
is old-fashioned and will probably loose significance in new and upcoming
languages.

<note: this needs less hype>


Comparisons with C
------------------

long *x;				x:PTR TO LONG
long x[10];				--
long dummy[10], *x=&dummy;		x[10]:ARRAY OF LONG

<note: more here>

(-- = not possible, because of value-semantics)


Often Made Mistakes
-------------------

DEF s[50]:STRING
s:='bla'

This does not get the 'bla' into the string, however there's nothing
wrong with it either, just not what programmer means. The expression
on the righthandside of the ":=" results in a pointer, and replaces the
pointer that was already in s, namely one to an empty STRING. To actually
make a copy of 'bla' instead of just moving the pointer around (which
is desired in 90% of the cases), use StrCopy().

<note: more examples here>


Conclusions: So does Strong-Typing suck?
----------------------------------------

Yes and no.
<note: explanation here>

Hi Jessie !

The only way I know is avalaible under 2.0. You must open a Public Screen. Then
open a file with Open() named for example 'CON:0/0/640/100/Shell'.
I don't know the possibility of the new 2.0 shell ( I mean options like /CLOSE
/WAIT...) there is probably a /PUBLIC option...
Under 1.3, opening a shell on a private screen (only the WB is public) is not
possible. Or I don't know how to do :)

Well dave, I did this for the IntuiSup.library. I tranlated the .h into .m
via the includes (.i). A friend of mine (Lionel, in this ML) convert me
this .h file into .i, Then I modified some C structure and constant definition
for my own use. Finally I compile this .i file with Iconvert (which needs
A68K and the C includes) into an E module.. That's it !
The most difficult is to convert the .h into .i. I don't have any C compiler...

Hope this helps...

Subject: Complete function list for Amiga-E

Does anyone have a list of all the functions provided by AmigaE. The 
documentation seems to leave out some functions like StringF() which I
only found out about by reading someone elses code.

Thanks in advance

Subject: IntuiSup.doc Addendum

Hi all,

I post this time a new version of my doc about the IntuiSup...
I added a section about the locale, and some news...

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
IntuiSup.library                                               IntuiSup.library


                            The missing DOC


Note : this file is *NOT* a part of the IntuiSup archive. I write it only
because there are some other users who will ask themself a lot of question
about using this library, and may be are as I am, a beginner in programmation,
or simply they wnt to know what can do this library.
There are some things that I don't know about this library. So don't ask me
what does one function do. It is only a summary with some comments.
the (?) means that I don't know what exactly does this function. I don't try
it yet !
This file is more a 'How to use' and 'whre to find that' file than a
technical one, where I can read nothing. All what you will read comes
directly from my own experience. There is no Doc, except a brief description
of the command.

All of this can be found in the example file semed in the archive...



I       What is the IntuiSup.library ?

        It is a gadget library compatible with all Amigas system from 1.3
    up to 3.0. It is written by Torsten Jürgenleit.
    The library can be found on Aminet sites, in the 'utils/libs' directory.


II      What does this library do more than the others ?

        Well, for 2.0+ system user, this library is only usefull in the way of
    how you program it in your code.
    For 1.3 system users, like me, it is a open door to the 2.0 system without
    having it !
    Here are the features that IntuiSup allows :

        - 3D look,
        - all 2.0 gadgets,
        - locale available under 1.3 !
        - and a Editor, but unfortunately, it produces C codes :(


III     How to link IntuiSup with Amiga E ? What about the E modules ?

        This is a critical point. The only way for E user to use an shared
    library, is to convert the pragmas and the include files into E modules.

    Pragmas : you can find the pragmas file called 'IntuiSup.h'
            Beware, there is many 'IntuiSup.h' files in the archive.
            Then use the Pragmas2module program to convert it. Place the
            resulting 'IntuiSup.m' in the EMODULES: directory.

    Include : There is no IntuiSup.i file in the package. The only way to do
            is to convert the include 'IntuiSup.h' (not the same as the
            Pragmas one) with a C processor into 'IntuiSup.i'. And then
            convert this latter file with Iconvert (which need the SAS/C
            Includes and A68k). Place the result in the 'EMODULES:Libraries/'
            directory.

    That's it for the modules !

    Note 1 : I translated these files in E modules, but modified some constants
        (They are very very long : some are 25 chars long !)

    Note 2 : In the Include file, you will find a C structure for the gadgets
        with a C union within. Just erase this structure, we don't use it
        as far as we will use E lists and the GadgetData structure/object.


IV      Is there something special in the use of IntuiSup ?

        Yes, it is the internal variable, which is used in fast all the
    fonctions. This is the only way to the library to know where it is !
    This is because the IntuiSup modify all Intuition messages by adding
    its own. So it is not very painful to add this library in your code,
    because all message will be send through intuition. The only minor
    difference is to replace the functions GetMsg() and ReplyMsg() with
    IGetMsg() and IReply(). That's all !
    For the lists and structure/objects, lists must be 0-terminated.
    (INTUISUP_DATA_END = 0)


V       About the gadgets, how do we code them ?

        Simple, we will use lists to create our gadget.
    The way to do it is :

    DEF gadgets

    gadgets:=[ type,flags,x,y,w,h,text,textattr,data1,data2,data3,
               type,flags,x,y,w,h,text,textattr,data1,data2,data3,
               .......
                  0,    0,0,0,0,0,   0,       0,    0,    0,    0 ]:gadgetdata


    Note that you must have at least in the 'emodules:libraries/intuisup.m'
    module the gadgetdata structure/object. The union can be deleted. This is
    the object equivalent to the C structure we must have :

        OBJECT GadgetData [
            gd_Types,
            gd_Flags,
            gd_LeftEdge,
            gd_Width,
            gd_Height,
            gd_Text,
            gd_TextAttr : textattr
            gd_Data1,
            gd_Data2,
            gd_Data3 ]

    You will notice that the string gadget need a 4th Data. You can add this
    one in this 'onject' before compiling the module, but don't forget to add
    a 4th NIL data in ALL gadgets...

    Entries :
            Note that these entries are definied as constant.

        type : one of the ten gadgets (1..11)
                 1 = Button
                 2 = Check
                 3 = Mutual Exclude (mx)
                 4 = String
                 5 = Integer
                 6 = Slider
                 7 = Scroller
                 8 = Cycle
                 9 = Count
                10 = ListView
                11 = Palette

        flags : 13 flags are available
                1    = gadget disabled (ghosted)
                2    = no border
                4    = Highlight with Complement colour
                8    = vertical orientation
                16   = Hot Key
                32   = No text Output
                64   = Text is displayed on the left  side of the gadget
                128  = ----------------- ------ right ------- ----------
                512  = -----------------        above         ----------
                1024 = -----------------        under         ----------
                2048 = Button toggle
                4096 = Button image
        x,y,w,h : coordinates of the gadget
        text : a pointer to a string or a dynamic string
        textattr : pointer to the TextAttributes strutures or a list

        datas :
            here are the meaning of the 3 (or 4) datas for each kind of
            gadgets :

            Button :
                data 1 : button state : 0 = not selected, 1 = selected
                data 2 : button image (not selected)
                data 3 : button image (when selected)
            Check :
                data 1 : check state : 0 = not selected, 1 = selected
                data 2 : check pad1 (?)
                data 3 : check pad2 (?)
            Mutual exclude (MX) :
                data 1 : # of pixel sepring 2 radio gadgets
                data 2 : num of the active entry
                data 3 : pointer to a text array or a 0-terminated list
            String :
                data 1 : length of the input
                data 2 : offset of the next string gadget to be activated
                data 3 : offset of the previous string gadget to be activated
                data 4 : default text that is displayed
                         NOTE : this 4th data is NOT written anywhere. The
                                author says that there is 3 datas in the
                                GadgetData structure/objet.
            Integer :
                Same as String
            Slider :
                data 1 : minimum level
                data 2 : maximum level
                data 3 : current position
            Scroller :
                data 1 : # of visible entries
                data 2 : # of total entries
                data 3 : cuurent entry (the top one)
            Cycle :
                data 1 : # of pixel separing pop up cycle (?)
                data 2 : # of current cycle text pointer text array (?)
                data 3 : pointer to cycle text pointer array (?)
            Count :
                data 1 : minimum value
                data 2 : maximum value
                data 3 : current default value
            ListView :
                data 1 : # of pixel separating 2 entries
                data 2 : current entry (the top one)
                data 3 : pointer to a List structure/object
            Palette :
                data 1 : # of bitplanes to be displayed
                data 2 : first color in the palette (?)
                data 3 : selected color


    Example :

        DEF gadget,internalvar,txtattr,gadgetlist

        internamvar:=IgetRenderInfos(screen,RENDERINFOSFLAGS)
        txtattr:=['topaz',8,0,0] : textattr
        gad:=[  1,0, 10, 15,120, 13,'Button1'       ,txtattr,0,0,0,
                3,1,530,167,120, 13,'Mutual Exclude',txtattr,0,0,
                                                            ['1st item',
                                                             '2nd item',
                                                             NIL],
                1,0,370, 15,120, 13,'Button2'       ,txtattr,0,0,0,
                0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 ] : gadgetdata

        gadgetlist:=IcreateGadgets(internalvar,gad,0,0,NIL)

    Note that you can't pass this gadgetlist in the declaration of a window..
    To display the gadget, you must call the IdisplayGadgets(window,gadgetlist)
    function.
    The same is to remove a list of gadget from a window, you must call the
    IremoveGadgets(gadgetlist) and then, if you don't want to use anymore
    this list, call IfreeGadgetList(gadgetlist).


VI      Are there others structures/objects ?

        Yes :
    the BorderData, which allows you to draw 3D border

        OBJECT BorderData
            bd_Type,
            bd_LeftEdge,
            bd_TopEdge,
            bd_Width,
            bd_Height ]

    the TextData , which allows to pass text and text flags to some functions

        OBJECT TextData
            gd_Type,
            gd_Flags,
            gd_LeftEdge,
            gd_TopEdge,
            gd_Text,
            gd_TxtAttr : TextAttr ]

    Note that it is possible to make an E list of any number of Data, in the
    form of the GadgetData above.


VII     And about requesters ?

        Sorry, but I prefer to use the great ReqTools.library
    However, requester and auto resquet can be made. There is no file
    requester :(
    The structure/object is called 'RequesterData' :

        OBJECT RequestData [
            rd_LeftEdge,
            rd_TopEdge,
            rd_Width,
            rd_Height,
            rd_Flags,
            rd_Title,
            rd_Texts : TextAttr
            rd_Borders : BorderData
            rd_Gadgets : GadgetData ]


VIII    Do you try then menus ?

        No, not yet. May be sooner than I'm thinking :)
        The structure/object is named 'MenuData' :

            OBJECT MenuData [
                md_Type,
                md_Flags,
                md_Name,
                md_CommandKey,
                md_MutualExclude ]


IX      You said, the localization is available ?

        Well, yes. As far as I saw in the doc, a fonction can create a
        'Langage Text Array'. We can find in the archive '.langage' files, so
        I suppose that's the locale is implemented ! But, looking at these
        locale files, I notice that they are ASCII files. I'm not sure that
        locale files are in ASCII form, but in some IFF form.
        Sorry I don't try to use it...


Conclusion :

        Well that is all, folks ! I hope that you will enjoy using this library.
    I think more particularly to 1.3 system users like me. If some one else
    is making a 'How to use' file ; please mail it me before end of July 94
    (I'm returning to France, yes I'm French, studying in Germany !)

You can get it on vertain Aminet sites... I found it only on :
 - ftp.cs,tu-berlin.de
 - ftp.wustl.edu
 - ftp.etsu.edu

The archive is 571 Ko long !!!!
You can find my an updated doc in the ML of E

Well, this isn't wrong, just a bit large (especially if you want to reserve a
block of 1000 of them...).  It would be nicer to just store pointers to the
strings in this object, so this is the first change:

/* Database template */
OBJECT entry
  memberNum, first, last, business, address1, address2,
  city, state, zip, phone, expires, computer
ENDOBJECT

(In retrospect it looks like Jeffery really wanted to have E-strings in the
object [something from a STRING declaration or String() call], but this will
do for those, too.)

The next problem was reading a lump of memory from a file (in read_list()).
The code is OK, but then Jeffery tries to use the lump as if it were a string
(a normal string not an E-string).  As it stood, the code could run off into
unreserved memory because the lump was not NIL terminated (so it wasn't really
a string).  This can be fixed by making the lump one bigger and sticking the
NIL at the end, so this:

>     flen:=FileLength('current.dex')
>     IF (mem:=New(flen))= NIL
>     ...
>     IF Read(file, mem, flen)<>flen
>     ...

becomes this:

  flen:=FileLength('current.dex')
  IF (mem:=New(flen+1))=NIL /* We need extra byte to terminate string */
  ...
  IF Read(file, mem, flen)<>flen
  ...
  Close(file)
  mem[flen]:=NIL  /* mem can now be a string (but not an E-string) */

Now Jeffery commits a real E sin: he treats the lump of memory (which isn't
even a string) as an E-string.  This is because he uses it as the first
argument to MidStr() (see the Reference.doc).  I don't know how he gets away
with it, but he does.  This will undoubtly cause memory reads from unreserved
memory.  And in fact the MidStr() was overkill: all he need do was increase
the pointer "mem" appropriately.  Also lurking in the code was the invalid
call to Val().  The second argument *must* be a pointer to a variable (or
appropriate memory), and not the value of a variable.  Therefore the second
argument should have been "{a}", not simply "a".  So, this:

>     tmp:=InStr(mem, '\n',0); MidStr(st, mem, 0, tmp)
>     numEntries:=Val(mem,a)
>     MidStr(mem,mem,tmp+1, ALL)

becomes this:

  t1:=InStr(mem,'\n', 0);  MidStr(st, mem, 0, t1)
  numEntries:=Val(mem, {a})  /* Must pass an address {a} or NIL */
  mem:=mem+t1  /* Now mem points to start of next line */

or this if you want to check that the number is valid:

  t1:=InStr(mem,'\n', 0);  MidStr(st, mem, 0, t1)
  numEntries:=Val(mem, {a})  /* Must pass an address {a} or NIL */
  IF a=0
    WriteF('Number of entries is not a number!!\n')
    CleanUp(21)
  ENDIF
  IF (numEntries<0) OR (numEntries>MAXENTRIES)
    WriteF('Invalid number of entries!!\n')
    CleanUp(22)
  ENDIF
  mem:=mem+t1  /* Now mem points to start of next line */

Now we've hit the FOR loop in read_list().  Generally, Jeffery does something
similar to the following to read each entry:

>         t1:=InStr(mem,'|',0); MidStr(list.memberNum,mem,0,t1)
>         MidStr(mem,mem,t1+1, ALL)
>         IF (tmp:=InStr(list.memberNum,'|',0)) <> TRUE
>             jnk:=(list.memberNum)+tmp+2; StrCopy(jnk,'', ALL)
>             ENDIF

This commits the same MidStr() sin twice (the "list" entry elements were
ARRAYs and so cannot be used as E-strings).  Then something weird happens with
StrCopy() and "jnk" (which is a pointer to LONG ???).  So "jnk" is not an
E-string and it's being used as the first argument to StrCopy(), which is the
same sin as the MidStr() sin.  If the entry object elements were pointers to
E-strings we could use StrCopy() or MidStr() to copy the string from the
memory block, but as it is we can use a more sneaky trick: the | character can
be replaced by a NIL to terminate each field in the record and we can use the
memory in "mem" (being careful not to Dispose(mem) at the end, becuase we want
to keep it around). [The second solution copies the memory into fixed sized
String()'s, which is arguably better.]

    IF (t1:=InStr(mem, '|', 0))=NOT_FOUND
      WriteF('Failed to read member number for entry \d\n', a)
      CleanUp(23)
    ENDIF
    mem[t1]:=NIL   /* Turn | into a NIL to make it a string */
    list.memberNum:=mem
    mem:=mem+t1+1  /* mem is still valid */

Notice that there's a bit more error trapping in here, too. (The constant
NOT_FOUND is -1, and is a handy constant to define [you could use TRUE I
suppose but it doesn't read so well...])  N.B. DON'T FORGET TO REMOVE THE
Dispose(mem) FROM THE END OF THE read_list() PROCEDURE IF YOU DO THIS.

Next up is a bug in E v2.1b.  It's been fixed in later versions, though.

>         list:=list+(SIZEOF entry)

This ought to be replaced by:

    list++

because "list" has been declared as "PTR TO entry".  However, in v2.1b it
doesn't increase "list" at all :-(  Since I am lucky enough to have a newer,
beta version of EC I can reveal that this has already been fixed, so you
should be able to do that in v3.0 when it arrives.

Well, that's all the potential Enforcer hits I could find.  The "amedex2.e"
program uses the above method for getting the fields from the records as is
nice and similar to Jeffery's original program. "amedex3.e" does what I think
Jeffery was trying to do, using fixed sized String()'s for each of the fields
and copying them from the input.  It uses ReadStr() to keep memory usage to a
minimum, reading a line of input on each go.  It also tidies up all the error
processing by using exceptions (which might serve as a useful example).  Be
careful to spot the automatic exceptions on String() etc.

The uuencoded archive follows (with Jeffery's original "dex.e" and database
file "current.dex" for completeness):

Basically, when you open a screen, give it a public screen name (and
make if public of course :-))

Then, when you open a window, specify the public screen that your had
just created.

Subject: PROBLEMS....PROBLEMS...PROBLEMS


Hi All,

   I've been working on my game over the weekend and everything seemed 
to be going ok. I had done everything that I had set out to do.

   With Barry's help I was able to get my screen public.

   I got my proc to draw the maps working right. I had to change my info.
from hex to decimal. I also found my function to raise a number to a 
power (Shl()). With this I was able to leave out about 60 IF statements.

   I even got my charater icon drawn. This is where my problem starts.
After I had my little character drawn, I wanted to see if I would be
able to move it like I had planned to. I'm planning to use the keypad
as movement, so that by pressing 8 the character would move towards the 
top of the screen. This worked fine the first time I entered an 8, but
when I entered another 8 I got a guru  $8000 0003.

   I don't have any idea as to what is causing the problem. The only
thing that I think it might be is the way that I have opened my screen
and made it public. That part I copyed word for word out of the 
pubscreen.e example and then changed it some to make it hires interlaced.

   Maybe some of you who knows more than me can see what I've done wrong
or not done at all. Until I get this problem figured out I can't go any 
farther with it.

   Another question that I have is, how do I set the palette for my screen
and how to give it that 2.0'ish look. I want windows and cons to look the
way they did when I was opening them on the workbench screen. I will use
the colors that I have on my workbench, but I need to know how to set 
them on my screen.

   I have some more misc. questions but will save them for another post.

   Thanks in advance.

Here is my program. The data strings should work as is but the Line and
Box functions in the drawmap() proc should be put back into one statement
I think. I broke them down so that they would mail better.

Don't forget to cut this out

Please let me know if you can find what's wrong with it.

Thanks in advance

There have been a variety of problems with my feed system in the last
couple of weeks. We think that these are finally fixed and both mail
and news are flowing fine through bkhouse again. 

Unfortunately, the problems caused a number of delays and other oddities
with regard to amigae list mail, and all I can do in response is ask
for your patience. We really are working very hard to keep all the mailing
lists here at bkhouse running as smoothly as possible.

Thanks!

Norm.

I suppose that depends on what you think is normal? :)

Anyway, yes there have been problems with double mailings of some postings.
These are not coming from my site, but from the next one upstream, who
receives all the outgoing list mail via SMTP. So far, the problem has
defied all attempts to figure it out, but we have at least gone from
doubling every posting to doubling just some of them. I think that we
are finally on the right track, and I hope to have this cleared up soon.

Please, everyone, accept my apologies for all these burps in the mailing
list administration and dissemination. In one week, both my site (bkhouse)
and my feed site went through major system upgrades, and it is taking a
bit to straighten out the results of those ill-timed tandem changes.

Norm.

Mail has been slow lately so I don't know if anyone's answered this for 
you.  The problem is in the line "scrFont:PTR to textfont".  Change the 
"textfont" to "tf" and it will compile.

Later,

Subject: Ah ?

Hi all,

I look into a source someone mail to the ML for some week. It is called 
'AmEdex'.

Well I saw the following decalration of an object :

/* Database template */
OBJECT entry
    memberNum[5]:ARRAY
    first[40]:ARRAY
    last[40]:ARRAY
    business[40]:ARRAY
    address1[40]:ARRAY
    address2[40]:ARRAY
    city[30]:ARRAY
    state[10]:ARRAY
    zip[10]:ARRAY
    phone[20]:ARRAY
    expires[9]:ARRAY
    computer[20]:ARRAY
ENDOBJECT

The first, last, address1 and 2 items are used as String variable. Is this really a correct definition, or is it good to use the String() statement ?

Here is how the use of then item are done, after openening a file :

        t1:=InStr(mem,'|',0); MidStr(list.first,mem,0,t1)
        MidStr(mem,mem,t1+1,ALL)
        IF (tmp:=InStr(list.first,'|',0)) <> TRUE
            jnk:=list.first+tmp+2; StrCopy(jnk,'', ALL)
            ENDIF

Could we do a such statement : object.item := Stringvar ?

Bye...

I'm waiting for a answer about the ReqTools and and ARRAY OF STRING ...

Subject: converting .h to .m

Hello,
A friend of mine has bought himself a registered copy of a BBS programme,
called Xenolink.
with this, he got a few .h files to create 'C' programmes for doors etc.
I've tried to convert these files to .m, but several of them turn outas
files of ONE byte. this obviousely is wrong.
So, can anybody tell me what's going on? am I using the wrong
converter? or is it just an OLD one..
I could really use your help, because my friend is thinking of deserting to C!

This would certainly not work even if it did compile. the contents of the
variable 'g' has changed several times since it held the pointer to
the string gadget.  Also, ActivateGadget() requires a pointer to the gadget
structure, not an id.    In the case I've noted above it would be:

ActivateGadget(mystringgadget,requeststringwnd,NIL)

> I can't get the program to compile when I have this in. My string gadget is 

:-)  You have g.gadgetid.0    Strange construction you have there  :-)

Yes, I got exactly the same problem, and I know I've seen messages from
other people who get the same problem with 'E' .
What a downer.. I really really need to use iffparse.library   :-(

Sounds extremely tedious.   :-)

I found a much easier way anyway..  thanks for the reply though.

Uhuh... Good start  :)

mm yeah.. Assuming you have a lock to work with. I found that trying
to do anything with a device that didn't have a volume in it either had
no lock to work with, or
popped a requester 'Please insert volume "" in df0:'

After a lot of stuffing around, I found a way to get it to work, which
involved locking the device if there was no lock available, and making
sure my process windowptr was set to prevent the requester popping up.

I think I used NameFromLock() on the device's lock to find the volume name.

That's a matter of opinion  :-)
Thanks for all the info.. I ended up sorting it all out a couple of
nights ago.. I decided to go into a frenzy with RKMs autodocs includes
and stuff spread out all over the place, including both Amigas..
:-)

Yeah.. umm that's all great but you still get that requester when
you try to do something with, for example, DF0: if there is no
disk in there  :)  I fixed that bit up by getting my task like this.


DEF mytask:PTR TO process

...
mytask:=FindTask(NIL)

...
temp:=mytask.windowptr
mytask.windowptr:=-1

/*scan the device list*/

mytask.windowptr:=temp

No nasty requesters if a device is empty!

As far as I'm aware, you cannot legally open a window on a screen you don't
own unless it is the workbench screen or a public screen. I can't remember
exactly but i have a feeling that OpenS() doesn't allow you to open
a public screen.
Personally, I've never used OpenS() since OpenScreenTagList() is a lot
more versatile (but not WB 1.3)
Once you open a public screen, you can open a console window on it like this

con:=Open('con:0/0/640/256/MyScreenTitle/screenPUBSCREENNAME',MODE_NEWFILE)

replace 'PUBSCREENNAME' with the actual publicscreen name of the screen
in question.

To open a window on a publicscreen you can use OpenWindowTagList()
and include in the taglist:

...,WA_PUBSCREENNAME,pubscreenname,....

where 'pubscreenname' contains the name of the publicscreen.

Hi Guys (and maybe Gals),

   Found my problem with FAE. I had used an assignment ':=' where
I should have used '='. Once I fixed that it didn't GURU again, but
it didn't work right either. Looks like I'm going to have to use
CASE and SELECT's. Oh well, slowly but surely, at least I'm learning
and that's mainly what I wanted to do in the first place.

It's not really a headache at all. The amigae-request@bkhouse.cts.com
address still works, it just refers everything to the listserv. Folks
who mail a request to that address which does not include a valid 
listserv request (such as SUBSCRIBE) will get a cheerful little note
explaining how to use the listserv. 15 or so of these have gone out 
already, just since Friday. 

We are getting a lot of new subscriptions all of a sudden, as well as a
bunch of deletions, but since many of our list members are of the "strong,
silent type", it remains to be seen what long term impact this will 
have on the list. Right now the list is at just under 170 members, and 
growing every week. It's been much more successful than I ever thought 
it would be when I first started it last spring. Much like my garden, 
I've really enjoyed watching it sprout, grow and mature.

Norm.

A number's a number's a number, dude. :-)  A hex string is an 
"image" of a binary number, and you have the luxury in E of 
looking at the binary number in more than one form.  It's all 
in the perspective.

~8>   Also I haven't been able to find any mention of how to raise a number

PROC exp(n, p)
/*-- Computes n**p. --*/
  DEF i, x=1
  FOR i:=1 TO p DOx:=x*n
ENDPROC x

Are you storing the data as binary or ascii?  In binary a 0

You may be wrong, because in the GadTools chapter of RKM Libraries, where
it talks about Keyboard Equivalent behavior, it says to "use Intuition's
ActivateGadget() call" with Text and Number Entry gadgets.

Subject: Bugs in the Mod() function

After a lot of debugging of code that ought to have worked, I
discovered that the Mod function seems to be VERY broken.  As we
[ought to] all know, taking an integer mod N should *always* get you
an integer between 0 and n-1.  Well, it ain't so in E.  A simple
test reveals:

Modulo: Mod(11,8) = 3
Modulo: Mod(6,8) = 6
Modulo: Mod(1,8) = 1
Modulo: Mod(-4,8) = -4
Modulo: Mod(-9,8) = -1
Modulo: Mod(-14,8) = -6

Which is clearly broken.  In the course of pursuing this, I discovered
that simple division ain't a prize, either:

Dividing 11 / 8 = 1
Dividing 6 / 8 = 0
Dividing 1 / 8 = 0
Dividing -4 / 8 = 0
Dividing -9 / 8 = -1
Dividing -14 / 8 = -1

It is astounding to me to try to understand arithmetic in an environment
where:

    (A - B) / B  does *NOT* equal (A / B) - 1

Subject: Some stuff..

	Well, some announcements, etc..
	I have just uploaded  Eformat 1.4  to aminet after having
ferretted  out the machine guruing bug. It  was Eformat. (I wasn't
initializing  the stack pointer.. duh.) So, to fix it, I switched to the
stack code in the E source archive. Now works like a charm, again. The
reason I even saw the bug is because the nested case stuff  wasn't working
on some WouterCode, when fixing that, I noticed the stack problem. My 
apologies to the person who reported the bug. My fault!

	Also, H2e is almost complete and should be up within the week. It
works fine so far, but does not do the following:
- any code!
- global/extern variables
- string constants
- Other goodies

AHUM!!! Hier spreekt de Eiffel kenner: Eiffel heeft excact dezelfde ref/value
semantics als Pascal. Het is alleen zo dat de meeste types standaard
referenced values hebben, maar je kunt ze net zo makkelijk 'expanded'
maken.
Een belangrijk verschil met C is dat in het gebruik je niet hoeft te weten
of een type expanded of referenced is. Dit is dus een schijnbare overeenkomst
met E, maar dat ligt dus NIET aan de reference semantics.

Tsja, je zegt het zelf al, E heeft toch nog value semantics voor scalaire
types, zoals de meeste talen.

I would quite like this and any other BOOPSI support you happen to have since
I would like to experiment with BOOPSI programming but have been held back by
the lack of these functions/macros.

Note that I can't compile this programme, cause I'm under 1.3....

Well, I have a questoin :
in the definition of the object l :

PROC initList(l:PTR TO mlh)
/*-- Initialize an exec list. --*/
  l.head:=l+4
  l.tail:=NIL
  l.tailpred:=l
ENDPROC

Why is l.head:=l+4, for what is this 4 ?
What is the meaning of .tailpred. I know the others items, but this not one.

/*-- This is where the string gadget buffer is hidden. --*/
  stringInfo:=stringGadget.specialinfo
  stringGadgetValue:=stringInfo.buffer
/*-------------------------------------------------------*/

What do you measn with 'hidden' ?


Must we always detach the list from the listview gadget before modifying it ?

Thanx for the answers !

No, not really.

Here's a snippet of code from my icon editor:

(Sorry for lack of comments.  Hopefully this example is straight forward 
enough to understand.)

PROC doloadpalette() HANDLE
  DEF iff=NIL:PTR TO iffhandle
  DEF ierror
  DEF sp=NIL:PTR storedproperty
  DEF body,size

  iff:=AllocIFF()
  iff.stream:=Open(palettename,MODE_OLDFILE)
  IF (iff.stream)
    InitIFFasDOS(iff)
  ELSE
    Raise(E_FILE)
  ENDIF

  ierror:=OpenIFF(iff,IFFF_READ)       /* Better error handling */
  ierror:=PropChunk(iff,"ILBM","CMAP") /* could be done here!   */
  ierror:=StopOnExit(iff,"ILBM","FORM")/* Actually, it could be */
  ierror:=ParseIFF(iff,IFFPARSE_SCAN)  /* improved throughout!  */

  IF(sp:=FindProp(iff,"ILBM","CMAP"))
    body:=sp.data
    size:=sp.size

    /*   This is where you'd handle the chunk.  It starts at
        "body", and has "size" number of bytes.

  ELSE
    Raise(E_IFF)  /* This just means no "CMAP" chunk was found. */
  ENDIF

  Raise(E_NONE)

EXCEPT

  IF (iff)
    CloseIFF(iff)
    IF (iff.stream) THEN Close(iff.stream)
    FreeIFF(iff)
  ENDIF

  IF exception<>E_NONE THEN errormessage(exception)
  
ENDPROC


The troubles you are running into might be due to not using the 
"StopOnExit" function.  I could not get this to work without it.  The 
example used here tells ParseIFF to stop when it is leaving the FORM 
chunk, which normally is the end of the file.

Hope this helps,

Subject: Re: FANTASY ADVENTURE ENGINE

Recently, thorntonj@beast.cs.hh.ab.com (Jessie) wrote in with his program
which seemed to not be working. Well, everything looks fine except a few
major string mistakes (E is more like C than BASIC or PASCAL).  All lines
like:

  vwalls := '65534000000001457854000000012600000004485069400000'+
            '9600000000179200000000006553400000'

should be StrCopy()'s (String Copy) like this:

  StrCopy(vwalls, '65534000000001457854000000012600000004485069400000'+
                  '9600000000179200000000006553400000', ALL)

And in docommand() the assignment in the IF will always be TRUE:

  IF command := '8'

What you really wanted to do is StrCmp() (String Compare):

  IF StrCmp(command, '8', ALL)

If you want to check just the first letter of the command string you
could write this instead:

  IF StrCmp(command, '8', 1)

With these changes things should work.

I know, I'm trying to make an animation player (just for the hell of
it), and like would be much nicer if I could get IFFParse to work.

I'm currently tinkering with an ILBM viewer that I made, and the amount
of code that I originally wrote to read and store the chunks of just one
picture was twice the amout needed to have IFFParse do it for me. Could
you imagine what I'd have to write to do a simple anim player?

Subject: Types!

You should create a list of C to E Typeing equivelents. (As some kind of
Glossary?) That would be a real bonus.
I'm not really strong on C programming, so when I look at C code to
figure out what is going on, Types can really be pretty convusing when
trying to make E equivelents.

BTW I'm trying to convert the AmigaDos 3.1 .i includes into .m files
with IConvert.

Needless to say, there are some .i files that don't want to work. (eg.
exec/ables.i or exec/exec.i or exec/initializers.i)

Any Suggestions? (I really want to have these includes!)

Why don't you make yourself famous and make a complete example and post it
to Aminet in /dev/e???  Personally I collect all the examples I can get so
when I have a problem I can see how someone else has done it.

Not quite sure what you are asking for, but I'll give it a shot.

If you are looking for an example of how to interpret and act upon gadget
selections, ftp the file "Spotlite.lha".  It's in the dev/e directory on
the Aminet sites (ftp.wustl.edu is the main site).

If you're trying to change the gadget text, I'm not sure if you can do 
that under gadtools (there are several dissappointing limitations on 
gagtools gadgets as I've found out over the last few days).  You may have 
to use a regular Intuition gadget.  (I could be wrong here.  I've been 
messing with BOOPSI gadgets too and I might have mixed them up.  Yet 
another sign of old age. B-)

Later,

     Jim

[various stuff]
 
-> Will E 3.0 have proper float support?
 
depends on what you call 'proper', but yes, it will have operators
that work on floats etc. in the language.

-> and I can't make heads or tails of its use in that program...
 
"|" was the float convertion operator in <2.1a, and shortly before
release I decided I didn't like floats like this in E, so I removed
the documentation about floats. Not many people know this, but
v2.1 actually has floats implemented, but a bit silly if you ask me.

well, yes [] lists and typed list should be able to get longer in the
future. If you trouble with the current limits just because you want to
have a large amount of data in your program, I might advice to use INT
(as statement) or INCBIN or something similar.

This is a false assumption many people have made. Those contrains

(off the top of my head)
PROC exponent(num,pow)

Unless I've totally gone bonkers that should return num^pow. (this really

	Hmm.. well, this information does not help when dealing with a

I'll take a look at it. Most people's E programming bugs are usually just
misconceptions about how E works, or how some function works. It's

	You're probably trying to use pragma2module. It only does the
pragma files (which tell a compiler what library has what functions I
believe.) P2M will not do any other .h file. However, take heart, as H2E
is nearly complete and I will release it within a few days. It will do the
normal .h files pretty much perfectly.

	Looks good, but something nags me about illegalities there. Can't

My programs live longer that way.

Hmm, Bernie, I'm not sure what the last equation (or non-equation) has to
to do your assertion that the Mod function is broken. As I recall (it's been
a long time since I got my degree in Math) the Mod function involves the
sign of the division operation being applied to the absolute value of the
result. In any event, I've always used a a working definition of Mod to
be the remainder after integral division. It seems correct to me as does
the example "integer" division examples.

4 is the size of a pointer. So l+4 is actually a pointer to the Tail 
field of the List.

Memory     List         Head Node      Tail Node
-----------------------------------------
 l         Head         Head.Succ          -
 l+4       Tail         Head.Pred      Tail.Succ   <- always NIL
 l+8       TailPred         -          Tail.Pred

This is how you should think of a list. Even though there are only 3 
pointers, there are actually 4, but because 2 of them are always NIL 
(Head.Pred and Tail.Succ), you can put them in the same memory to save 
space. So l is a pointer to the Head Node and l+4 is a pointer to the 
tail node. The Head node's successor is the tail node when the list is 
empty, hence List.Head:=l+4

It's not really hidden, just that C= buried it rather deep in the gadget 
structure :-)

Yes. Otherwise Intuition might try to refresh the gadget using the list 
while you were messing about with its pointers. That's the disadvantage 
of a pre-emptive multitasking system :-)

Hope this helps,

Dave

P.S. If you have the RKM Libraries there is a whole chapter on Lists 
which probably explains them better than I can.

In fact the Mod function is not broken at all. Virtually all mod 
functions in computer languages work in the fashion you have described. 
You'll just have to find a workaround if you want a strictly positive 
answer, I'm afraid. You could try Mod(Mod(a,n)+n,n). Or, if your n is a 
power of 2, use (a and (n-1)).

Ermm ... actually I think it does. Can you give an example where E does 
not exhibit this behaviour?

Thanks for the warning!  I wasn't using IsFileSystem() anyway  :)

No bug in E. A project Im working on here works fine. It can  recognize
the pathname/filename of any drawer/file icon dropped on it and can tell
when it has been double-clicked.


> the RKM, the .name part is there, and according to E, it is not.  Ok I can

Of course it is. Check if the .lock is there first.
I don't think you can drop appicons onto appicons.

> handle that.  I look up the appmessage structure in 'workbench/workbench'

arglist is a LONG which points to a list of arguments.
Step through the list.
The C examples show exactly how to do it.
use the appmessage.numargs to find how long the list is and use a counter
to step trough the list.

What the????  appmsg.arglist points to a list of arguments, not a list of
names.  Add this variable somewhere:    argptr:PTR TO wbarg

then before this loop you have:

argptr:=appmsg.arglist

then inside the loop refer to argptr.lock and argptr.name for the lock and
name of the icon dropped on your appicon
It's in that RKM example I believe.

All that looks correct to me.. are you expecting maybe floating point
numbers from integers?

Since you aren't using floating point math, what else can you expect?

First convert the .h files into .i files using the C preprocessor.  This
will strip out crap that may confuse iconvert.  Then iconvert your new
files to .m files.  Note that I haven't actually done this myself, but I
have heard it works.  It's worth looking into at any rate.

Subject: FALSE?

I know this is the E list, but since False and E were written
be the same author, I was wondering if anyone has managed to get
FALSE to work on an IBM?  I couldn't get it to compile with
Turbo C++, and Power C compiled, it, but it wouldn't work right.

If anyone managed to get it to work, please send me mail.

Subject: More questons about Gadtools.

Thanx Berry for the info.  I now able to use the sliders and buttons andd
check boxs and cycle gadgets.
Now...  I need to figure out the getfile gadget.  In the gadtoolsbox
the Icon for the file button is there.  When I convert it to E with
srcgen.  I seem to loose the file button?  Any help on this?
Also I have been looking in the RKRM book for how to put strings into
text box's.  I am lost on that one.
Eric  <NES@DELPHI.COM>
BTW I am leaving for Itay on the 19th of Feb.  Any amiga E people near
Florence... Also will have a layover in Munich and Gatwick(England)...
Chow...

If you are really interested, look for quip7e.lha (or somesuch) in the aminet
directories.  It's written in E, includes the source code, and has implemented
the reading of tooltypes (although in a semi-nonstandard way... it reads the
tooltypes of tool as well as project icons, so you can create various project
icons to govern how Quip works).  The tooltypes code were a minor modification
of Term's code, converted from C to E.

Perhaps I should simply upload the code itself to dev/e, so people won't have
to bother searching for it... it addresses a number of programming issues that
might be of interest (tooltypes, ReadArgs, error-handling, etc).  For those who
haven't heard me babble about it before, Quip is a fortune cookie program, but
it's an extremely ADVANCED fortune cookie program, with some scripting
comands and stuff (I intended for it to be useful for BBS sysops).

I can't remember exactly which directory Quip wound up in.. but I'll see if I
can't find it, and put the source code in the /dev/e directory.

	I really would convert the .h files myself. I got the last bit of
information on C stuff I needed today, so as soon as I implement the last
bit of code, H2E will be done. (Yeah, I know, I've said that already.) Of
course, for a copy of those includes I could send you a copy damn quick. heh.

>Any Suggestions? (I really want to have these includes!)

	Be patient. H2E will solve your troubles. I myself am really
amazed at how easy it was and how well it works.

	Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA() sounds like what you're looking for. I take
it you are operating without rkms/autodocs?

	Actually, with some effort, you can contort gadtools into all
sorts of neat things. Resizable gadgets are possible. (I've done it.),
changing button/gadget text is trivial. To the original asker of the
question: Post exactly what you want  to do, and any  relevant  source.
It'll aid in getting a useable reply. Anything I could give you right now
would be way too vague to be of use.

	Well, the problem is not in my code, it's in converted C code. C
programmers  really  seem to love massive constant structures. E, however,
does not.

	Enforce? What is this, basic? Really, this is another thing that
is causing my problems with C2e. Not important from a strictly E
programming point of view, but hard to deal with for C conversion. I
actually kind of like that it's for the sake of readability, but it
really is getting in my way.

Subject: float support

Hi

Could someone who has been able to use floats easily under the current 2.1b
float system provide some examples for use.

If possible Wouter could please send me the original float documented info that
was in the reference manual.

I would like use of floats and the knowledge to use them.
I understand that the floating point representation will change with 3.0
but I will change my code if I ever need to recompile.

	First be sure that you have correctly installed it, especially the E
generation code module that must be in the modules/ directory.
	If MUIBuilder is properly installed, design your application, go to
the code window, choose the kind of generation you want (the whole apllication
code or simply a lonely object code), and finally choose the filename you
want for the generated source file in the filerequester. Then, the generated
file should be created. If you have more problems, check with SnoopDos and
e-mail me the results.
	One more thing : you must of course choose to generate E code instead
of C code in the config window.

Subject: List View and Intuisup.library

Hi all,

I try with success to code a list View gadget wit the IntuiSup.library
The following code shows how to do. It is not very usefull, but works.
There are one button and a list view. Each time you press on the button or
an item of the list view, an another item (counter) is added..
Aaaaaaaargggghh, the file is corrupted... WEll, I rewrite some lines..
This code should be ok...

I only have problem with AddHead() which cause a GURU :(
If some one could explain me why !

Thanx,

Hi all,

Is there anywere a file of all known bug of the Amiga E 2.1b. My club will
spread the french archive I translated in to french. So I'm sure I will be 
asked for bugs..
If there is no file, could all of you send me the bugs YOU know, and Through
the ML. So that sound-likes-bugs could be removed.
Thanx for help

*B) Hi, !

Hi, Olivier!

*B) Well I must thanx Barry and Kenny : I recieve 5 mails with the gtlv.e ! 3 from
*B) Kenny, 2 from Barry.

Heh.  Sorry, that was during one of the troublesome times
of the mailing list.  I sent it once and it hung.  When I
sent it again, 'cause I didn't think it made it...that's
how you got two from me. :-)  Next time you should mail 
someone privately because list members have no way of 
knowing who's going to respond to your request.

*B) Note that I can't compile this programme, cause I'm under 1.3....

Isn't Gadtools 1.4 on Aminet a KS1.3-specific library?

*B) Well, I have a questoin :
*B) in the definition of the object l :
*B) 
*B) PROC initList(l:PTR TO mlh)
*B) /*-- Initialize an exec list. --*/
*B)   l.head:=l+4
*B)   l.tail:=NIL
*B)   l.tailpred:=l
*B) ENDPROC
*B) 
*B) Why is l.head:=l+4, for what is this 4 ?
*B) What is the meaning of .tailpred. I know the others items, but this not one.

Dave Higginson answered this question sufficiently.  l.head
will hold the *address* of l.tail, so if/when we can do
multiple dereferencing, we can say:

  IF l.head.succ<>NIL THEN ... /*list not empty*/

For now, I just use:

  IF l.tailpred<>l THEN ...

*B) /*-- This is where the string gadget buffer is hidden. --*/
*B)   stringInfo:=stringGadget.specialinfo
*B)   stringGadgetValue:=stringInfo.buffer
*B) /*-------------------------------------------------------*/
*B) 
*B) What do you measn with 'hidden' ?

I meant what I said.  Really, it's a joke.  I had to dig and
dig to find out how to get that info out of the gadget, and
I was a little miffed.

*B) Must we always detach the list from the listview gadget before modifying it ?

Any time. :-)

 From the fingers of Bernie:

*B) Modulo: Mod(11,8) = 3

11/8=1, remainder=3

*B) Modulo: Mod(6,8) = 6

6/8=0, remainder=6

*B) Modulo: Mod(-9,8) = -1

-9/8=-1, remainder=-1

*B) Dividing 11 / 8 = 1
*B) Dividing 6 / 8 = 0
*B) Dividing 1 / 8 = 0
*B) Dividing -4 / 8 = 0
*B) Dividing -9 / 8 = -1
*B) Dividing -14 / 8 = -1

This is integer division.

*B)     (A - B) / B  does *NOT* equal (A / B) - 1

This is rarely true in the world of integer division. :-)
Trying using the mathfpp.library functions.

I forgot to mention, Bernie, that the reference says:

[QUOTE]

  a:=Mod(b,c)

Divides 32bit b by 16bit c and returns 16bit modulo a

[ENDQUOTE]

This will give weird results if c exceeds max-int.
Wouter likes it this way, so I made a function that
does 32bit modulo:

  PROC mod(this, bythat) RETURN this-Mul(bythat, Div(this, bythat))

Enjoy.

Subject: FAE update

Hi All,

  Just a few lines to let you know where I am with FAE and what's
planned for the near future.

  Well I've solved most of my problems. I got my screen working,
map is drawn, and most movement routines done.

  When I get the following items done I will release a copy to
the list so you can see what I've done so far.

    1) finish diag movement checks.
    2) check for open or closed doors, only allow movement
       thru an open door and show door opened or closed

  That's about it. What I've got planned for the near future is to
take the data out of the program and create an external file, this
will be the start of being able to create maps larger than 16x16.

  Now a question, not concerning FAE, what editor do those of you
who write large programs use? 

  Here are some of the little problems that I have had while trying
to write FAE.

  First, I started out with EGUI. This was nice, pick your program,
hit the edit button, make your changes or whateverand when youwere
through hit a button and compile it, press another button to run
your program. This was all good. Then I got jed and started using
it with EGUI. Then I started getting DOS errors Object In Use and 
it wouldn't save the changes I had made. I thought maybe it was jed
because I hadn't had those problems using ED. Then I started getting
the errors with ED. I also got them if using jed by itself.

  I had EDS so I thought I would try it. I couldn't even get it to run
Then I remebered that I had an update. With the update I got it running.
EDS looks nice but I couldn't tell you how it is to use. Every file I
have tried to open gives me a status of File Being Watched (or something
like that).

  I had ESEE and thought I would give it a try but I don't have GoldED
so I can't even tell you what this program looks like to run.

  What I've ended up using is MEMACS. I can edit my source, then
open a cli screen, compile my code, and run my program. Then end
the cli session and I'm right where I was in my editing. This is
ok but not exactly what I'd like to use.

  I guess I'll keep looking till I find something I like and that works.

Later

> Now...  I need to figure out the getfile gadget .....

Well there may be a problem there as the getfile gadget is actually a boopsi
image incorporated into gadtoolsbox.

I dont know much about srcgen but maybe its due to the fact that normally you#
have to link your code with the file boopsi.o that comes with gadtoolsbox.

So maybe this hasnt been implimented yet into srcgen.
The best thing to do is come up with an intuiimage for some getfile gadget and
then just create it as a rendered gadget - not using gadtools.library cos that
dont support image gadgets.

I know this probably isnt the right place - but Im after a program that converts
a dpaint brush to an intuiimage.

I could write something that decrunched it and did it but i dont really want to
waste the time if someone else has written something already.

I need the program to load the brush in , and then save it out as a binary file
telling me the dimensions of the intuiimage it has saved - so that I can
incorporate it into my code buy using a standard image object and copying the
binary to chip mem after loading it with INCBIN.

I want it to strip all the CMAP and BMHD stuff - I just want pure data.

Subject: List View and IntuiSuip.library

Hi all

Yesterday I post a source using the IntuiSup.library and a List View gadget.
My source was coorupt. Well not exactly : The PC disk drive of this $#%^ HP-
UNIX add a sector which doesn't belong to the file, and scratch the end ofd the code. However, reading the file on my Amiga, all is fine. Sooo ?
Here it is again ! and its working...

I code this source in my GUI for LHA, and it doesn't work. Well not the list
but when I re-attch the list to the Gadget. The program stop. Ther is not
GURU or alert, other application continues to run... I don't understand.
The problem comes from the IsetGadgetAttributes(). I check the gadgetlist, the
gadget offset, all of these are correct. I don't know where the non-error comes
from !

Is there really nobody who codes with the IntuiSup.library v4.7 ?

It looks to me - although I dont use intuition support library like you might
not be detahcing the list from the listview before you alter it.

Like?  :-)  Just requesters... The only requester likely to pop
up during acess to the device list is one asking to insert a disk
(as far as I can see) Other stuff can damned well leave my window
alone!   :)

the getfile gadget isn't strictly a gadtools gadget.
With SRCGEN, you do get the gadget. It is actually there but it
has no imagery, and doesn't give an IDCMP_GADGETUp/DOWN message.
Look for a gadget in the gadget list (CreateGadgetA()) that is
a GENERIC_KIND gadget. That'll be it. You need to supply and image
for it as wellas telling the gadget what sort of activation it
should be (IMMEDIATE and/or RELVERIFY)
See the RKMs how.

> Also I have been looking in the RKRM book for how to put strings into

If you mean TEXT_KIND gadtools gadget then nothing could be easier.
Just supply in the gadget's taglist something like this
[GTTX_TEXT,'my text',...,...,TAG_DONE]

You could also just draw a bevel box and print the text there yourself
using Amiga-E's TextF()  or intuitions PrintIText()

Subject: ASlL


Hi

Last night I had a problem with the Asl library.
The RKM suggests you use AllocAslRequest(ASL_FILEREQUEST,[taglist,NIL])

Now I placed a few WriteF's in convenient places only to find that the program
was failing with the call below - it was popping up the requester 

Wait for disk activity to finish
Program failed #800000b Reboot or Suspend

Ive come across this before and never properly understood what was going off.

My call was exactly

IF fr:= AllocAslRequest(ASL_FILEREQUESTER,[ASL_HAIL,'Choose an icon',
					   ASL_PATTERN,'#?.info',
					   ASL_FUNCFLAGS,FILF_PATGAD,
					   TAG_DONE])

Where fr was just declared locally as

DEF fr:PTR to filerequestr

/* nb filrequestr NOT filerequester */

It is here that the program fails.
Sorry that Im not able to give you the full code but the disk its on is
formatted under kick3.0 and the amigas im using are 1.3.

What am I doing wrong?
Possible thoughts are

1 .. Should I declare fr as so and give it some space.
     I though AllocAslRequest got the space for you as you never pass
     fr as an argument - only to AslRequest after AllocAslRequest returns
     and this just inst returning at all.

2 .. Do I need to specify the tags in a certain order or maybe specify more
     tags like ASL_HEIGHT for the height of the file requester window or
     ASL_WIDTH for the width reqpectively.
     I thought tags were invented cos they gave the programmer a set of
     defaults that he could choose to ignore.

Any answer would be appreciated.
Darren.

Well, I try it, but the name of the library is NOT the same as the 2.0 
version... and this library is bugged :( as well as the others ones (asl and
iffparse)

And I have problem to re attach it on my ListView gadget (no error, no alert,

Just remembered a little problem I had with E a good while back and never
really fixed, it was for some folks on the FidoNet E echo, involving AppIcon
usage.  I used the example from RKM libraries, with coomplete success, except
for a line that involved indexing the information for a selected gadget by a
number, something vaguely like:

appicon[].name
appicon[].<something else>

How could this king of code be implemented in E?

Subject: Bug in EC (?)


I've got something that I feel is a bug in the EC compilor, although it may
already have been addressed.

I do not know what the circumstances are that cause it, but I tried to do a
comparison against NIL (that is, my code says something like IF blah<>NIL,
which I know is redundant, but I'm weird) the compilor gives a Software Error
(the 8[0's]3 kind) and freezes up on me.

That was the only change I had made in my code, since the last time I had
sucessfully compiled it.

You can even see the compilor counting up the lines, getting to line 1000
before, bam, guru (and the IF statement is at line 1006).

Note, this isn't a matter of MY code bombing when I try to run it.. this is a
matter of the compilor itself bombing when I make it compile my source code.

If you'd like, Wouter, I can send an uuencoded archive of the source code (in
its entirety), as well as the text that appears prior to the bomb, with a recap
of what I had done just prior to the fatal compile.

Try TDS, It's OK.
Quality-wise, TDS is very very high quality.
But from ease of use, it has no feedback whatsoever, there's no
visual indication of whether or not you really have a project open
or what project the current source belongs to.
But try it you might like it.

Have fun

	Cygnus ED 3.5 PRO of course. Thanks to Wouter and the wonder of
Arexx, I have a nice little programming environ happenning. F1 to compile,
F2 to compile and run. Works great.

	Well, it certainly is a time honroed source code editor. Sure
isn't fun to use though. Better than Ed I guess. (Ed blows dog.)

Subject: Keyboard Intercept

I was wondering...is it possible to write a program in E that will 
intercept key presses?  Let me explain, that's kind of vague.  What I'd 
like to do is write a program that runs concurrently with my terminal 
program and that "intercepts" any keys pressed on the keypad and send 
whatever I want in its place.  Example: The rest of the keyboard works 
normally. But say I press '0' on the keypad - the program would then 
intercept the '0' and replace it with the word 'directory' which would 
then be picked up by the terminal program.  

It sounds like it should be doable, but I'd like to make sure before I 
invest the time in it.  Thanks.

It uses dictionaries like GoldEd does and does everything I ever wanted an

I just want to one of hundreds of E users who are going to answer the
part of your question about "number -> ascii string". Since the first
public release of E, there has been the StringF function. It is related
to the WriteF thusly: instead of a filehandle, the first parameter of
a StringF function is an E string. What it does is that using the second
parameter as a formatting string it then converts the remaining parameters
as specified by the formatting string but instead of then writing the
result to the filehandle parameter as in a WriteF, it just puts the
output string into the E-string parameter that is the first parameter of
the StringF command. Thus to convert a number to a string one could do:

StringF(str,'\d',num)

As I said before, E has the function, but Wouter has not documented it so
that's why you probably don't know about it. I'm not sure if the semantics
of the function have changed since 2.0 but as of that version, StringF was
an arithmetic valued function. The result of the function was the
difference between the maximum length of the string variable and the number
of characters that were output by the function to the E-string parameter OR
to look at it another way, the result is the number of characters that
remain avaiable to be used. Please note that there is no restriction to
the format string and thus the StringF function, in addition to being
used to output a number as an ascii string (I assume you meant as a decimal
number), it could also be used to convert a number to an ascii string that
is the hexidecimal representation [ StringF(str,'\h',num) ] or it could be
used to do other strange things such as concatconate two (or more) strings:

StringF(str_out,'\s\s',str1,str2)

It could also be used as a substitute to the StrCopy function:

StringF(str_out,'string literal')

Maybe the reason Wouter didn't document the StringF function is that it
would take to much space to document all the ways it could be used. (:-D)
Also, with a StringF function, at least two other E functions would not be
needed, i.e. StrAdd and StrCopy.

Right, and in EVERY example you cited in your previous message you
carefully [and correctly] used the term "remainder".  The fact is
that this statement [QUOTE or not] is incorrect... 'modulo' is a
perfectly well-defined term [go check a textbook on abstract algebra
or group theory or galois fields or the like[*]] and what E implements
*ain't* modulo.  I wish it _were_, since modulo is a useful arithmetic
function to have.
  [*] For example, the ARexx reference I have here gives the usual
  simple explanation: "what is called 'modulo arithmetic', or,
  from its most familiar illustration in everyday life, 'clock arithmetic'.
  What is the sum of ten and seven?  Seventeen?  Not on a twelve-hour
  clock: the answer is five.  You could say that adding twelve on a clock
  is equivalent to adding zero, since it leaves the hands in the same
  position.  ..."

} This will give weird results if c exceeds max-int.
} Wouter likes it this way, so I made a function that
} does 32bit modulo:
} 
}   PROC mod(this, bythat) RETURN this-Mul(bythat, Div(this, bythat))

Unfortunately it doesn't.  It returns the *remainder*.  Not the same
as modulo.  [actually it would be if EEs, the guys that designed
the ALUs on the CPU chips, had even the merest beginning of a clue
about how arithmetic works.  For a VERY long time I've argued about
this with hardware designers... they take the attitude that since
*THEY* don't know enough math to be able to tell the difference
they figure it doesn't matter, and so CPUs implement all sorts of
truly *dumb* conventions when it comes to whats-the-quotient and
whats-the-remainder.  I've learned to live with that [gritting my
teeth, of course].  I'm not as complacent about doing so with
"modulo", since there is *no*reason* to make that confusing
[and/or pretend that because _you_ don't know what the precise
definition of modulo arithmetic is, that there isn't one and so
it doesn't matter what you do].  As I suggested, if Wouter just
changes the docs to call it "Rem" or some such, my program wouldn't
have been any closer-to-working but at least it'd have been clear
what is going on.

Not a big deal in any scheme of things, but one of my hot-buttons since
I've been trying to argue some _basic_ math into hardheaded hardware
designers for almost 30 years now....

Yep, there is one, I learn from Barry, or Trey,....
It is the StringF() function :

DEF l,
    str[10] : STRING

l:=10

StringF(str,'\d',l)

WriteF('The string is \s\n',str)

For years now, I've been using MEmacs for my Amiga development, from 
the OS 1.2 version on my A1000 back in '86 to the version that came
with OS 2.1 that I run on my A3000. It doesn't do everything I'd like 
it to, although I hear that the one that comes with OS 3.X is pretty 
nice, but it works and works reliably. I try other editors, but I
keep coming back to MEmacs.

I've also tried all the other editors you mentioned, but I've always
found that my idea of a developer's editor and most Amiga author's
ideas about them are quite different. I'm probably biased somewhat
by my use of Brief as my editor for MS-DOS work, a program I've used
for this since it was a beta release from Underware in the early 80's. 

I wasn't impressed with CygnusEd in the least, though I know that
many, many people are.

GoldEd is a nice editor, but it has a few oddities that I just can't
live with. Most of the keys are redefinable, which is nice, but some 
of the movement functions don't work in the way that I am used to. I 
don't know about the current version, but what finally drove me away 
from GoldEd was its assumption that "end-of-line" meant the last 
character on the line, not the last character + 1, as most editors do. 
It drove me nuts. That and GoldEd's general instability.

GnuEmacs is a nice system, but I refuse to devote that much disk space
to an *editor*. You'd think we were talking about Windows applications,
with all this nonsense about needing multiple megabytes just to edit
text.

Lately I've been toying around with the Twilight Editor, which is part
of the Twilight Development System (TDS???.lha on AmiNet). I like it 
quite a bit, and it seems very configurable. I have, for the most part,
been able to get it to act in the way that I want it to, and it comes
with AmigaE support built in. It has a project manager that is very 
nice, and supports E. It looks like this may be the editor that I'll 
move to. It seems to be well worth its $15 (US) shareware fee.

One warning: The demo version of TED available on AmiNet has a 200 
line limit on the files it will edit, and this is worth knowing ahead 
of time (the exact limit isn't stated in the docs, as far as I saw). 
TED will let you load a file of any size and make changes without any 
warnings until you try to save it. Of course, since I feel that good 
programming style precludes more than the occasional file with more 
than 200 lines, this really isn't a problem. :) I'll register anyway, 
though, just to support the author. I know what a disappointment this
shareware game can be.

Yeah it would: from laughing.  DirOpus is such a pig!!!  I can handle a
few inconveniences when it comes to the difference between DirWork and
DirOpus.  I must admit, DirOpus is nice.  However it's such a speed and
memory pig that it's not even worth my time.

Instead of using a getfile gadget (generic gadget) I just use a button
just big enough to hold a character.  In PPI I used a button with '*'
inside of it.

GoldED is on Aminet, most probably in the util/edit dir. Look for ged096.lha
or something similar. Then use it with ESEE and smile.

Well, I'm coding a GUI. My code has more than 1500 lines.. I never had a GURU

Subject: Dev Tools and E (was "Re: FAE update")

Alan says:

*B) Try TDS, It's OK.
*B) Quality-wise, TDS is very very high quality.
*B) But from ease of use, it has no feedback whatsoever, there's no
*B) visual indication of whether or not you really have a project open
*B) or what project the current source belongs to.
*B) But try it you might like it.

No, thanks.  I use EE exclusively now.  If I were using another
language at all, I might try another dev tool, but I'm not.  EE 
is designed expressly for E.  I'm using EE to develop EE in E,
so it's getting a lot of testing as well.  My advice to you is
don't waste yer money in a hurry on some generic development
tool.  If you're serious about E, wait for the Freeware release
of EE.  Then you have my blessing to squander your cash, since
it will be an informed decision. :-) :-)

EE will have some overlapping of functionality with EDS, but
they should be compatible once EE incorporates ARexx, so you
EDS-lovers out there can still enjoy EDS's comfy environment.

As Mark Langston might say:

"Other development tools soon get soggy in milk..."

Sorry about the lengthy plug for EE.  I figgered it's E news
that most will be thankful for later on.  If not, then I'm a
lot more out of touch with reality than I suspected. :-) :-)

Later.

Subject: The Magic 8 Ball, or how to use AreaEllipse...

Here's my wonderful (yeah right :^) )  Magic 8 Ball.
It's really simple.  Ask a question, click on the ball. :^)
And it shows the right (I hope) way to draw circles in a
window on the workbench screen.  If there's any glaring
logical errors in the program flow please tell me, I mean it
runs and all, but I haven't torture tested it :^)
Oh, you need times 18 in fonts:

Sounds from your example like:

  WriteF('time=12: 15 hours later it's \d\n', Mod(15, 12))

I still don't see it.  Mod(12,12) = 0, just like the example.

	Not only doable, it's quite easy. Are you sure you want to invest
the time writing it? There are many PD commodities out there that do that
sort of thing. Almost every mouse accesory commodity does. Yak, Mach,
ClockDJ, etc..
	If you really really want to write your own however, here's a
start: Grab E_Commodity.lha off of aminet. It's an example commodity that
monitors the keyboard and redirects the output to stdio. This commodity
can be modified with some work to produce that effect.

The orginal sender's address is in the header in the at least one of the
fields, so you do have access to their email address. What happens with
the server software is that the Reply-To header is set to the list so
that pressing 'R' (or whatever you press to reply to mail) will 
automatically set up amigae@bkhouse.cts.com as the default To address.
Depending on your mail software, there are many ways around that, 
unless your site is banging up the headers and losing the original 
address.

Folks,

Do you think we can stay on the subject of E for the list, please?
This discussion could easily be carried on via private email or on the 
USENET newsgroup comp.sys.amiga.applications. Not that it isn't 
interesting, but it's not what the list is about.

Thanks!

Norm.

OK, I'll try this slowly.  "modulo arithmetic" refers to a
particular sort of arithmetic over a finite field.  In every
mathematical context using the term, the concept of "modulo n"
refers to operations over a field best modelled as the integers
from (0, ..., n-1), where each 'integer' is actually an equivalence
class: the member 'k' of the field is actually the equiv class of
all integers of the form (k + x*n), for all integral x.  form a
field with the arithmetic operations defined over the integers in
the usual way. There are subtleties if you want to talk about 'n'
being negative or fractional, but those aren't relevant for the
current discussion.

At the least, I _might_ be able to get Wouter to change it from Mod()
to Rem() or _at_least_ get the docs to say explictly that it implements
nothing more than 'remainder' [regardless of what it is called]....
not likely but it's a shot...

[I've given up hope of anyone actually *implementing* a real mod
function, and so if I need to do modular arithmetic [as in the
clock example] the only alternative is to do it brute-force [and
the little expression you wrote above *doesn't* do it,
unfortunately [yes, i did try that! it just gets you the remainder
back again on most [but not all!] architectures]].

Real modular arithmetic is useful and it is really a shame that
because of a bunch of EEs a long time ago not caring [or not knowing
any better], computers now don't support it, when they trivially could.
such is life..

	I converted asm includes v40.13 into Amiga E modules this week-end
using IConvert. But I had a lot of problems with A68K/asm include format.
I think I fixed them in 95% of the cases, but for the remaining 5%, I can't
assure you that the conversion is perfect. Anyway, those problems are local
to rarely used modules (like card.m).
	I can e-mail them for each of you who want them (I prefer personal
e-mail than a global e-mail to the list because the archive is quite big :-)).
Simply e-mail me. If there are really too much demands for them, I'll e-mail
them directly to the list.

	I have the v39 autodocs (so they exists :-)) but not the v40 :-(...

Subject: aslbase

Hi

I was recently told that declaring aslbase locally before you set it equal
to the opened library base address is DISASTROUS!

Are there any more things in modules, apart from constants that are declared
globally - also except for library base pointers.

I wouldnt want to use em in my code and make the same mistake twice.

Subject: Re: Keyboard Intercept

Sounds like a good job for a commodity here! They get the input events
before intuition, so it`s just a matter of remapping the keyboard
events to a whole bunch of input events corresponding to the keypresses
you want instead... assuming you are running os2+

Otherwise, you`ll jut have to rite an interrupt timed to the keyboard
and go patch that... not entirely sure how to do this not, but I did
it once in assembler...

Come to think of it, the easiest way would just create a new keymap
(there are some pd editors) that bound the new keys to the presses,
if you can do this in your term software.
