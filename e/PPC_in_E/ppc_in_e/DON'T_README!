EXPLANATION
-----------

I started translating almost all Phase5 ppc.library includes in order to help someone in creating
a new E compiler which supports 603 & 604 processors.
I don't know if they are really useful at the moment, but you don't never know :-))
So here yo can find all the includes contained in the very latest version of Phase5 Developer Kit.
Just one include is not translated and it's contained into the "ToDo" directory: I don't know what 
those cryptical C syntax means on the first lines.
If someone wants to translate it, it's welcomed but I don't think that header will be really useful,
as it's stated in the header itself.

I kept the majority of the remarks and comments in order to have a better idea of what the functions
means.

There are also two 680x0 exes in the relative drawer, take a look at it !
