Long: 

Reference.guide documentation adapted from Reference.doc for Wooter van
Oortmerssen's 'E' compilor for the Amiga.  This .guide has appropriate
cross-referencing, indexes, and whatnot.  When printed out, it even looks
nice when carefully stapled to your very best suit.

Mr. van Oortmerssen has examined this .guide himself, and approved its
uploading.
