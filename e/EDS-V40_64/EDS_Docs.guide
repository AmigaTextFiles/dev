  Program: EDS - The E Development System
  Version: V40.64
  Programmer: Jeffrey J Peden ][ - AKA WiZkID
  Company: GammaSoft
  Using: Amiga E Version 2.1B
  When: July 1993 -> February 1994
  
  Requirements: Any Amiga, with enough memory to suit your needs,
                a Hard Drive (I suppose you COULD program in E 
                w/ a floppy...), Workbench 2.x/3.x

                @{" ReqTools.library " link ReqTools} V38+
                @{" Amiga E " link AmigaE} Version 2.1+ (Hey, Wouter where's 3.0???)
                @{" EPP " link EPP} Version 1.1+ (Also included -- Thanx to B. Wills!)
                @{" ARexx " link ARexx}

  Source:   Registered users MAY obtain the source by contacting me directly
            (this means CALLING me, or mailing me...but its better to call)
            It provides MANY useful things that beginners can learn from...
            IT MUST NOT BE BE RELEASED OR CHANGED IN ANY WAY...AND IS NOT 
            TO BE USED IN ANOTHER E INTERFACE

                @{" Registered " link Share} users must pay $5 extra to get the source.

	When I first started programming and learning the E language, I was 
somewhat disappointed with just a compiler and the modules and exapmles... 
I wanted something where I could point and click and do anything I wanted. 
I would often get confused, losing my shell, having to quit out of my editor 
to compile, having to click hundreds of windows to front and back... then 
I found Ez_E - which was something like what I wanted.  It let me run my 
editor, and compile the sources, and do most things from a small window 
that hung above my editor.  This worked for a while.  But when I decided 
to give up on my first E project (GammaTag 3.0 - a conversion from my 
ARexx tagliner), I had grand ideas of a whole system for programming in E.
Something to take care of EC, EPP, an editor (at first JED was the only
choice), and launching external programs.
	  
	In July of 1993, I loaded up GadToolsBox 2.0, and began tinkering with 
a potential GUI.  At first, I was just going to design the GUI, and let a 
friend of mine do all the dirty work, with me Beta testing and adding 
smaller, easier features when I could, but as he was already working on a 
project, I decided to go ahead and work on it on my own. 
	
	By the end of August of 93, I had something I could actually call a 
program. I released EDS V39.10 (and about a week later V39.12 - a couple of bug fixes) 

	Unfortunately, although people I talked to seemed to like what I had 
done, they either did not like my choice of editor (JED was still hard coded 
in), or the font I had chosen, or screenmodes, or something... so NOT ONE 
SINGLE PERSON registered.  I seriously though about quitting the project, 
but as I began to actually use the program myself (while writing it, it was 
nearly impossible to use and write and test at once) I began to really like 
what I had done, and began to think about what else I could put in that 
might make it work a little better.  

	First on my list of things to do was user definable preferences.  I 
already had somewhat of a preferences file for the external program 
launch buttons, and just built on top of that. Font and screenmode were 
the first to be implemented.  Then I created a GUI for it (this was at the 
end of September 93) - and when I at last got SrcGen (thank god for the 
aminet dev/e directory!) I built it into the program.  Later I added 
palette, a GUI for editing the buttons (and menus), Overscan, editor 
commands (I finally got to making it editor independant), and a lot of 
other stuff.

	Other little features I added were an APPIcon, commodities support (you 
can use Exchange to hide/show/quit EDS), a sleep system (you can either use 
the AppMenu or Exchange to unsleep EDS), the ability to open EDS on the 
Workbench, and even a system of managing Projects (which let you define a 
NAME, SOURCEFILE, and a PREFSFILE to use for a certain project)... 

	I truly think I have gone as far as possible in putting usable features 
into EDS.  I hope that everyone else thinks it is worth what I am asking for 
it.  I have spent much more time on EDS in the last year than I should 
have... considering I have been in school for more than half of the time 
I have been working on it, and often more time would go into the program 
than homework! 

@endnode

@node Share "Shareware and ©opyright info"

	EDS is a shareware program, if you use it, you must register it. If you 
want to see future versions, then you should register it. I am putting a 
requester on the save function, to further remind you.  If you are a ßeta 
tester, you do not have this requester, but if  you continue to use EDS after 
the trial is over, you should register it too (Of course, I'll give ya a 
discount...) If you decide not to register it, you must delete it after 7 
(seven) days.  And furthermore, if you don't intend to use it, but you 
think it's a nice piece of work, I _WILL_ take donations :-) 
	EDS is not to be included in any commercial product, in any form. If you 
want to include EDS in a commercial product, the author MUST be payed a 
set loyalty charge (no more than the  registration fee, but depending on 
the quantity, it could be lower).  EDS is not to be redistributed in it's 
registered form, but the  unregistered version may be put on BBSs only. The 
only exception to that rule is Fred Fish (CD or Disk), Aminet, and to 
Wouter, if he feels like doing something with the unregistered form.  Any 
other collection that charges for the disk containing EDS must recieve 
permission from the author. You can of course give the NON REGISTERED 
VERSION TO YOUR FRIENDS.
	I am making the product shareware to pay for my phone bill which kept 
me in touch with the Amiga E mailing list. But, since I don't like to pay 
lots of money for any shareware program (Rush, Terminus, etc) I didn't want 
to make it cost too much.  I figure $15 is reasonable enough for anyone to 
pay (thats usually low enough for me to break down and give the author some 
credit), so that is what I am making registration. That $15 goes towards 
the $100+ of dollars I spent this summer getting the E Mailing List alone, 
a disk with your own, personalized copy of EDS (and anything else I can throw 
on), mailing of the disk, and of course the usual blood, sweat, and 
electricity that went into the making of EDS. (please kids, don't try 
combining the last two ingredients at home... :-)  
	If you want the source code, it is an extra $5.  I don't want the 
source being modified and redistributed, so I figure I'll charge extra 
for it.  BUT, it is a great example for those just learning E. It uses ALOT 
of the system (ASL, ReqTools, ToolTypes, Reading/Writing files, Strings 
(cause of 99.9% of my early crashes), GadTools, and much much more) to do 
certain things.      

So, here is the breakdown:
          EDS Registration............$15.00
          EDS Source...................$5.00
          ----------------------------------
          Both........................$20.00

    BTW: You have to register to get the source :-)

    You can send CASH (US $$) or a Money Order (Postal is OK) with the
correct amount to:

        GammaSoft - EDS Registration
        Attn: WiZkId
        8 Jared Ln

    If you need to contact me, for any reason (such as asking if I 
will take a check) I can be reached, for now, on the internet at

@node Install "Installing EDS -- Early ßeta Release"

	Hopefully, this will be an extinct section in the very near future (and may be by the time you read this).  Hopefully, I will be able to write an Installer Script for EDS very soon, and take a load off of your shoulders, but for now, here are a few steps on how to install EDS manually...

	Manual Installation
@{b}(1)@{ub} Unarchive the LHA file (well, if you're reading this, one down... so many more to go) 
@{b}(2)@{ub} Make the directory: ENVARC:EDS/ (ENVARC should already be set up as part of the WB 2.x/3.x installation)
@{b}(3)@{ub} Copy the files from this distribution in "envarc/eds/" (the only one NEEDED is EDS.Prefs) to "envarc:eds/"
@{b}(3)@{ub} Copy EDS, EDS.info, and the documentation to wherever you want it.
@{b}(4)@{ub} Create the Environmental Variables AUTHOR and COMPANY.  These will are small text files (one line) that are stored in ENV: (I just used "SetEnv AUTHOR WiZkId" and "SetEnv COMPANY GammaSoft"; and copied "ENV:AUTHOR" and "ENV:COMPANY" to ENVARC:)
@{b}(5)@{ub} Edit the @{" ToolTypes " link ttypes} to whatever you need.
@{b}(6)@{ub} Double Click Away!
@endnode

@node ttypes

Here is a list of all the tooltypes recognized by EDS and what they mean.  Some are self explanatory.

	@{b}ED_PORT=JED.1 @{ub}
		This Tooltype lets you select an AREXX port for whatever editor you are using
	@{b}EC_PATH=C:@{ub}
		Gee... I wonder... could it be where EDS is supposed to look for EC?
	@{b}EPP_PATH=C:@{ub}
		Hmmm... another tough one... golly, maybe it's where EPP is supposed to be...
	@{b}EDITOR=Workbench:c/jed PUBSCREEN=EDS
		This is the line used to invoke whatever editor you want to use.  
	@{b}PROJECT_PATH=EDS:@{ub}
		This is where EDS: is supposed to default to as a directory.
	@{b}PMODULE_PATH=PMODULES:@{ub}
		This is the path to PMODULES for EPP.  
	@{b}PROJECT=EDS.e@{ub}
		This is the name of the default file to load.  Used in conjunction with AUTOLOAD
	@{b}AUTOLOAD=ON@{ub}
		This will load the name of the file given in PROJECT
	@{b}DEF_PREFS=ENV:EDS/EDS.Prefs@{ub}
		This is the name of the default preferences file to load.
	@{b}ICONX=285@{ub}
		This is the X position of the AppIcon
	@{b}ICONY=355@{ub}
		This is the Y position of the AppIcon
	@{b}APPICON=ON@{ub}
		This is whether the AppIcon is on or off
	@{b}USEBENCH=OFF@{ub}
		This is whether EDS opens on the Workbench or it's own screen.
	@{b}MAINWIN_X=0@{ub}
		This is the X position of the main (button) window when opened on WorkBench
	@{b}MAINWIN_Y=360@{ub}
		This is the Y position of the main (button) window when opened on WorkBench
	@{b}SECONDWIN_X=0@{ub}
		This is the X position of the second (RCS) window when opened on WorkBench
	@{b}SECONDWIN_Y=0@{ub}
		This is the Y position of the second (RCS) window when opened on WorkBench

	Only some are NEEDED to start EDS... some are not needed at all depending on how you want EDS set up.

@endnode

@node Setup "Customizing EDS -- Your way right away?"

	Almost all of this is self explanatory, but I'll go over it anyway.
	
	From the EDS main screen, you can access the preferences interface of 
EDS.  From there you can customize many different aspects of how EDS 
operates, and how you want things to look.
	
	@{b}Screenmode@{ub} - This is where you can select the screenmode for 
EDS to use.  This uses a standard ASL Screenmode requester (thanks to Colin 
Bell's Datatype viewer for how to do this).  If running under OS 2.04 (and 
not 2.1/3.x) this should open up a ReqTools requester instead.
	@{b}Font@{ub} - This lets you select the font you want to use.  This is 
a standard ASL font requester.  (I keep forgetting to add to the prefs file 
how to specify font size... dammit!)
	@(b}Overscan Type@{ub} - Lets you select the type of Overscan you 
want - you can play around with this one... Intuition sometimes gives me 
strange results with some screenmodes...
	@{b}Text Width@{ub} - This one lets you tell EDS whether you are using 
a half width font (such as Xen.font) or a full width one (topaz.font)
	@{b}Palette@{ub} - You may edit the first 8 colors of the palette for 
the screen, and save them in the prefs file, through this config panel.
	@{b}Configure Editor Commands@{ub} - Here you can edit the AREXX commands 
sent to the editor. All are self-explanatory, except for "Insert {39}" - 
this is to insert an ascii character 39; an apostrophe (')
	@{b}Set Console Output Window@{ub} - This lets you select the type of 
console window you want output (such as that from EC or EPP) to come from.
	@{b}User_1 -> User_15@{ub} - Here you can edit the buttons and menu itmes 
that are user definable. See @{"User Definable Buttons" link buttons}
	@{b}Projects@{ub} - (This is the listview below the buttons) Here you can 
define the projects which are accessable through the "Projects" button on the 
main screen.  (Currently "MISC" is not used)
	
@endnode

@node buttons "Your wish is my command!"

	EDS allows you to have 15 buttons and menus which you can define to do certain actions.  You can have EDS send an AREXX command, asynchronously launch you're favorite program (A shell is a nice thing to have here), or even load a file at the click of a button (quicker than projects, but not as definable)
	
	In the preferences interface, there are 15 buttons which, when clicked on, bring up a window which allows you to edit the values of them.
	
	@{b}Gad Text@{ub} is what shows up on the gadget and in the menu
	@{b}Command@{ub} is what is executed for a DOS type command, what is sent 
for an AREXX command, and what is loaded for a LOAD command
	@{b}Type@{ub} is the type of command.  You can select a DOS 
(asynchronously run), REXX (sent to an AREXX port), or LOAD (loaded into EDS) 
type  of command
	@{b}Misc@{ub} is only used for a REXX type command, and is the port which 
the command is sent to.

@endnode

@node Using "Using EDS -- So how do I use this damn thing?"

    Oh God, I've already told you how to set it up, and now I suppose you 
want me to tell you how to use it :-(

    Alright, I give! Everything is pretty self explanatory. When you LOAD a 
source file in, it will try and read the revision header from it, and will 
load it into memory. It also starts notification on the file when you load it in, so that the latest version of it is always in memory. (NOTE: This means that you cannot use EDS when working with an XFH handler...there is a bug in XFH) When the file is loaded in, if EDS finds a revision header, it will bump up the revision by .1 or .01 (depends on what the previous revision number was). LOAD brings up an ASL requester, RELOAD loads the file set in the name string gadget. 

    When loaded in, EDS will display the Filename, Author, Company, Todays 
Date, the TIME when EDS was started, and the revision string.  These are all 
in string gadgets. You can edit them by hand (TAB CYCLING is enabled) if you 
wish, and the info will be updated in memory.  

    When you SAVE, the information from the above string gadgets will be 
inserted into a (new) header in your source file (appended to the source). 
You can also use SAVE-AS to save the source with the header to a new file. 
This will bring up an ASL req for you to choose a filename (you can also 
write over another file this way, be careful!). BE WARNED, these functions 
of EDS DIRECTLY MODIFY THE SOURCE FILE, I WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR LOST OR TRASHED SOURCE. NOTE: If you use SaveAs, you should call a 
RELOAD afterwards to start a notify on the new file.

    Also saved, but not replaced, are comments for the current revision. 
With each revision, the prior comments are added to. I would only save the 
file when you have done something that represents a markable change in the 
source, as these comments can add up.  If they get to be too long, just start 
deleteing them from the end. 

	Something new to the V40 series of EDS is Projects.  These are sets of 
source files, prefs files, and a name given to them.  When you select 
PROJECTS from the main screen, it brings up a window with a list of 15 
projects which you may or may not have already defined.  If you click on 
a defined project, it will load that file, and the preferences file 
associated with it.  If you click on an undefined item, it will close the 
window and nothing will happen.  You can also click on the close gadget 
to get out of it.

    From EDS, you can call many different things. The first of these built 
in things is the text editor. I chose JED for my editor, as nobody was 
willing to write an editor in E with the same functions for me.  Hitting 
EDIT will open up JED with the current file loaded in (or none at all, as 
the case may be).  When you save a change in JED, it is automatically 
reloaded into EDS. Also, I have provided you with a number of different 
functions (jump, find, etc) of JED from EDS.  These give EDS a direct 
interface to JED through ARexx. You can define more of these, if you want, 
using your custom config file. 

    Also, EDS lets you call EPP, the famous pre-compiler. EDS will creat a 
backup copy, in case the pre-compile fails. This is deleted, if I my memory 
serves, after the pre-compile is done. You may want to do a SAVE-AS to RAM: 
before pre-compiling.  If you have a better way, you can make a script, 
calling EPP on your own. Output is sent to a CON: opened on the EDS Screen. 

    And, finally, EDS calls EC, the heart and soul of E. No options are passed, 
so you must set them manually in your code.  If enough people complain, I will 
probably change this, but for now thats the way it stands. Output is sent to a 
CON: opened on the EDS Screen. 

    The last EDS function is SendRXMsg. This will put up a reqtools requester 
asking you for the port first (defaults to AREXX) and then the command (will 
default to last command or none). Does not return any arguments

    There are also 15 commands that are basically just ARexx interfaces to 
JED.  Some are more involved, such as INSERT PMODULE or FIND STRING, but all 
are self explanatory. None will work if JED isn't running, but some will put 
up an EasyRequester and others won't do any action. The simple ones have the 
least amount of checking involved. 

@endnode

@node Bugs "EDS Bugs!? -- Where's that damn can of RAID?!"

	Well, I know there are some, but none that I can readily fix, or even 
know of.  One problem that has been noticed by my beta testers is in 
intuition message handling.  What happens is sometimes EDS will not recognize 
messages from intuiton.  I am not sure if this is a problem with intuition 
or with EDS, but it comes from the way that EDS handles multiple windows.  
In order to use multiple windows asynchronously, and also watch the AppIcon, 
and file notification, I decided to use a system of waiting on a combined 
signal mask from multiple message ports.  This does happen from time to 
time, and the best way to avoid it is to not click too many times on buttons, 
and wait until one task has finished before clicking again.  If you can't 
get it to recognize anything, try just click on the close gadget.  Also, 
some times if you cause intuition events which have no action (i.e. going 
to the menu, but not selecting anything; clicking in and out of a window).  
I see no way to really fix this.

	There are some other bugs, I know... just not know of.  If you find one,
send me some email, and if you have an idea on how to fix it, or if it means 
so much to you as to register and buy the source and fix it yourself, let 
me know.  Until this summer, I probably won't have loads of time to do much 
bug stomping.
