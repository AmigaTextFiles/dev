This directory contains two scripts for use with Csh (tested with version
5.48):

    GetADoc
	Extract autodocs from all E sources in the current directory to a
	destiation directory. Works recursively.

	Modify this script to your needs, you have to provide a path where
	C='s autodoc program (or similar) resides.

	A recommended place to put the	docs you get would be oodoc/autodocs.
	The docs of the original distribution have been removed for they were
	turned into amigaguide databases and can be found in oodoc/guides/.

    ADoc2AG
	Converts autodoc files source directory to amigaguide databases and
	puts them into a destination directory.

	Modify this script to your needs, you have to provide a path where
	C='s ad2ag program (or similar) resides.
