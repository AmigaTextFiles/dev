@node oo_and_me "OO and me"

OO came to me via E. I started with E in late 1993 when I found Ev2.1b on a
Fish disk (I think it was 848). E was - and still is - easy to learn, easy to
use and EC compiles fast. And there are a lot of exotic features. Still I
avoided to use unification successfully :)

When Ev3 was released I tried to use objects and methods rather than
structures and procs. Unluckily I failed for back then I was coding on my
old A500. After the code generation bug was fixed I tried to figure out what
OO was. I don't think I know it by now but I use some features in my sources.

Encapsulation and polymorphism are just to good to miss...

@node ooep "The ooep"

About one and a half years ago Trey mentioned the ooep. Almost instantly I
wanted to contribute to it. Well, I did contribute a lot. Right now (June
1996) I am the only one who works on it. Trey is busy with his job and the
people I mailed about the ooep are quiet.

If you read this in June '96 you're probably linked either to Aminet/dev/e
or the E mailing list. I'm launching the project to the public for the above
reasons. I've put too much work in it to let it go down.

The whole archive is provided as found on my hard disk. That leads to these
consequences:

  - Some objects may not work correctly. The reason for this is very simple:
    I'm all alone. I coded the objects and tested them. That's not how it
    should be. The programmer is not a good tester for his own program.

  - The documentation may be somewhat weird. I don't know if the docs are any
    good or just crap. Also they differ in style since my doc-writing style
    evolved over the months.

  - Test programs are missing. Often I designed an object to be able to design
    another. The test program of the first object mutated to an inheriting
    object.

I hope the whole archive is still useable. In fact I use these objects very
often:

  - elist
  - execlist
  - associative array
  - string list
  - GUI/requester/standard
  - file/textfile/programsource/*

The last things I worked on were exec/port/* and commodity before I returned
to my database objects.
