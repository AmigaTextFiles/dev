@{b}   PURPOSE@{ub}
       Basic implementation of the Library object.

@{b}   CREATION@{ub}
       back in Februaray of 1995 by Gregor Goldbach

@{b}   HISTORY@{ub}
       Joseph E. van Riper III overworked everything a bit.

@{b}   SEE ALSO@{ub}
       library/device

@EndNode

@Node "--library--()" "library/--library--"

@{b}   NAME@{ub}
        library

@{b}   ATTRIBUTES@{ub}
        libName -- the name of the library

        version -- version of the library. 33 is v1.2 of the AmigaOS,
        37 is OS2.04, 39 is OS3.0, 40 is OS3.1

@{b}   CREATION@{ub}
        back in February of 1995 by Gregor Goldbach

@{b}   HISTORY@{ub}
        JEVR3 changes; removed 'base', included 'name' and 'version',
        now included in the 'oomodules' hierarchy.
@EndNode

@Node "close()" "library/close"

@{b}   NAME@{ub}
       close() -- Close the library

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       library.close()

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
       Close the library. Not functional in this basic object, the
       derived objects have to take care of that.

@EndNode

@Node "end()" "library/end"

@{b}   NAME@{ub}
       end() -- Free resources.

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       library.end()

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
       Frees all resources used by this object. Automatically called
       when ENDing the object.

@{b}   NOTES@{ub}
       JEVR3 addition; seemed logical to make 'end()' @{"close()" Link "close()"} the library.

@EndNode

@Node "open()" "library/open"

@{b}   NAME@{ub}
       open() -- Open the library

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       library.open()

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
       
       Open the library. Not functional in this basic object, the
       derived objects have to take care of that.

@EndNode

@Node "select()" "library/select"

@{b}   NAME@{ub}
       select -- selection of actions via taglist

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       library.select()

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
       Select an action for this object upon initialization. See
       documentation of Object's @{"new()" Link "resource/new()"} and select.

       These items are recognized:
         "name" -- next item is library name

         "ver" -- next item is library version

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
       opts -- Optionslist

       i -- @{"index" Link "definitions/index()"} of optionlist
