       addToSystem() of @{"commodity" Link "commodity/commodity()"} -- Adds @{"commodity" Link "commodity/commodity()"} to the system.

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       commodity.addToSystem()

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
       The @{"commodity" Link "commodity/commodity()"} is installed by the commodities library, arguments set
       in @{"select()" Link "select()"} will be used. Check self.broker to know if the creation
       was successful or not. There may be an exception for this in the
       future.

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
       Opens commodities library if needed and creates @{"message" Link "standard/message()"} @{"port" Link "port/port()"}. Some
       flags are set. The @{"commodity" Link "commodity/commodity()"} is set to be unique.

       select() of @{"commodity" Link "commodity/commodity()"} -- Selection of action.

@{b}   SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       commodity.select(LONG, LONG)

       commodity.select(opts, i)

@{b}   FUNCTION@{ub}
       The following tags are recognized:
           "name" -- Name of cx.

           "title" -- Title of cx. Some simple line that says who did it.

           "desc" -- Short description line ('OS3 version', 'Testversion')

           "vers" -- Version byte

           "hotk" -- Hotkey @{"string" Link "reqtools/string()"}, e.g. 'control alt d'

           "open" -- Pointer to proc that will be called if the cx is told
               to open the gui. No arguments are passed.

           "clos" -- Pointer to proc that will be called if the cx is told
               to close the gui. No arguments are passed.

           "kill" -- Pointer to proc that will be called if the cx is told
               to kill the gui. No arguments are passed. If you use this tag
               be sure to call @{"removeFromSystem()" Link "removeFromSystem()"}.

           "now" -- If this tag is found in the list the cx is added to the
               system at once. Do *NOT* provide any more tags, this one has
               to be the last one in the list. If you do, behaviour is
               undefined.

       The tags "name", "titl", "desc" and "hotkey" have to be provided.
       However, this is not checked. If you forget one, behaviour is
       undefined.

@{b}   INPUTS@{ub}
       opts:LONG -- Option list.

       i:LONG -- Index of optionlist.

@{b}   RESULT@{ub}
       LONG -- Current @{"index" Link "definitions/index()"} we are at.

@{b}   EXAMPLE@{ub}
        NEW cx.new(["name", 'DevEnv',
                    "titl", 'DevEnv 0.5ß © 1995,6 Gregor Goldbach',

@Node "commodity()" "object/commodity"

@{b}   NAME@{ub}
       commodity of object -- Commodity object. Installs a commodity in the
           system.

@{b}   PURPOSE@{ub}
       Add commodity facilities to your application.

@{b}   ATTRIBUTES@{ub}
       broker:LONG -- Pointer to broker structure as returned and used
           by the commodities.library

       messagePort:PTR TO mp -- Message @{"port" Link "port/port()"} of the commodity. Messages
           arrive here when we press the hotkey, enable the commodity and
           so on.

       openGUIProc:LONG -- Address of the proc to call when the commodity is
           told to open the gui (via hotkey or exchange program). No
           arguments.

       closeGUIProc:LONG -- The opposite of the open gui proc.

       killProc:LONG -- Address of proc to call when the commodity is told
           to quit. If left NIL a standard proc is called that removes the
           commodity from the system, frees the @{"message" Link "standard/message()"} @{"port" Link "port/port()"} and other
           allocated resources. That standard proc is @{"removeFromSystem()" Link "removeFromSystem()"}.
           You may put your own proc here and call @{"removeFromSystem()" Link "removeFromSystem()"} when
           you're finished. See autodoc of that proc.

@{b}   NOTES@{ub}
       A quick & dirty implementation from one of my old sources. I'm sure it
       isn't finished.
