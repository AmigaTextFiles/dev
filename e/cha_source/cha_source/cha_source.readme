Author: cheilandallen@yahoo.co.uk (Claude Heiland-Allen)
Version: 2.2
Requires: nsm patched OctaMED SoundStudio

Introduction:
    I am writing quite a few plugins for OctaMED SoundStudio
at the moment, and these plugins share quite a large amount
of source code.  It is therefore awkward to separate out the
needed files for each package.
    As a result I have decided to release binary versions of
each package separately, but keep the sources together.
This is more convenient for me, and for you because you get
more examples for using parts of the code.


Note:
    This archive contains no compiled code.  To compile the
code a working E environment is needed, together with the
modules from the E nsm development package.
