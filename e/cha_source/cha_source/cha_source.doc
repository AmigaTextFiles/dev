My E coding style is highly modular object oriented, with one
class per source code file.  Here is a brief list of the files
present in this archive.

args.e              make reading args less painful
calcs.e             various audio related calculations
cbuffer.e           circular buffer, stores past data
cha_autotempo.e     autotempo plugin main program

cha_autotempo.script    | these scripts generate the archives
cha_bassdrum.script     | for distribution

If you have any questions then just ask - I haven't really
documented the code much.

If you want to write your own sample processing plugins then
study fxecho.e and cha_echo.e; these are the only files that
are specific to the echo plugin.


cha_filter

The program is based on mkfilter/mkshape/genplot by A. J. Fisher
<fisher@minster.york.ac.uk> originally in C-style C++ but adapted
by me to OO-style E.

filter_average.e    - experimental moving-average filter
filter_cbuffer.e    - modified cbuffer, to simplify code
filter_design.e     - abstract filter type, to get coefficients
filter_plot.e       - experimental graphical output
filter_specification.e  - command line interface, stores all args

filter_splane.e     - s-plane filter design
                    - prewarping: to enable correct conversion to a
                      z-plane filter the frequencies must be adjusted
                      to compensate for the conversion method; use
                      prebilinear() if s->z via bilinear transform,
                      prematchedz() for the matched z transform
                    - constructors:
                        - bessel:       Bessel filter, designed for a
                                        linear phase response but the
                                        phase response of the z-plane
                                        conversion may not be very
                                        linear
                        - butterworth:  Butterworth filter, designed
                                        for a flat pass band; the most
                                        commonly used type of filter
                        - chebyshev:    Chebyshev filter, designed for
                                        a steep cut-off slope at the
                                        expense of ripples in the pass
                                        band
                    - modifiers (must be called on constructed
                      object to get a meaningful filter)
                        - lowpass
                        - highpass
                        - bandpass
                        - bandstop
filter_zplane.e     - z-plane filter design
                    - constructors
                        - bilinear, matchedz convert from s-plane
                        - bandpass, allpass, notch resonators created
                          directly in the z-plane, from modifying a
                          bandpass resonator
