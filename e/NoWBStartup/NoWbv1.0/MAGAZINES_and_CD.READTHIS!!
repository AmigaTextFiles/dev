     NoWB is freely distributable, but here's a 
        NOTE TO MAGAZINES and CD PUBLISHERS:
       ************************************

      If you decided to include my program on a Coverdisk you'll you have 
to send me your magazine completely free, *with no* extra costs for me.


    Its the same way, as the other CD publishers (the only exception goes
                             -------------------   for the Aminet CD's.)
