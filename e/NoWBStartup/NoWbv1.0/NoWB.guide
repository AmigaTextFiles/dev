@Node What " Introduction"


      NoWB allows you to boot your system without the loading of any programs in the 'WBStartup' drawer.  It's useful when you want to save memory and also load the WBench. See @{" this " link UFO}.

      I decided to do this, since every time I selected 'Boot With No Startup-Sequence' on the Early Amiga Startup screen and typed 'LoadWB' on the CLI, the OS load every program I had on the 'WBStartup' drawer as usual, which some of them asked for some stuff on the ENV: and T: devices (which are not mounted at this moment, of course 8) )

@Node install " I said it would be simple ... "


    Err, put it where you want ...
@EndNode

@Node req " Requirements "


    This program requires at least OS2.xx. Anyway, it would not be of any use to users of OS1.3, since this OS don't have the WBStartup thing.

Also the DOS comms:

    - Setpatch
    - Rename
    - Wait
    - LoadWB

      Is there any ? Wow, then contact me ! @{" <*> " link Adress}

But before that take a look at the PROBLEMS section on @{" this " link Usage}. Thanks.

@EndNode

@Node Usage " How do I "


OK, let's go straigth to the point:

    Running NoWB with no options causes it to run 'Setpatch' from c: and also execute the s:user-startup by default.

So, if you don't want the execution of it, just give an 'n' as an argument.


    Type ? as usual if you forgot this *huge* amount of options 8)


PROBLEMS:
--------

  · On slow HD's, my program may not work right ... If that's the case, then type 'd number' as an argument were number is the number (WOW) of seconds it takes to finish. -> If you want to know why this happens, read @{" How it works " link how}

  · NoWB writes on you HD, so it is wise to *always* wait for it to finish disk access before rebooting your computer. Anyway, if you forget this and your programs on the WBStartup drawer are not executed anymore after that, then run the supplied 'NoWBdoctor' program ...

@EndNode

@Node bonus " Extra bytes "


      As a feature, each time NoWB is invoked, it executes a s:WB-startup file (if it exists) -> It was just a nice thing I decide to implement; Use it as you wish.

@Node UFO " Games Stuff ... "


      Whis this wondelful program, I've got enough memory in order to run the game UFO AGA from Workbench on a 2Mb A1200, without having to create a boot disk as said in the manual 8)

@Endnode

@Node fut " On the next century ... "


      Future version of this program will feature automatic disable of the WBstartup drawer on booting without having to run it on a CLI window, simply by having the user to turn Caps Lock ON before booting (@{"help me !" link caps}).

In the meanwhile will provide a right mouse button alternative for this, soon.

@Node caps " Can you do it ? "

@Endnode

@Node how " The riddle is solved ... "


      OK, first of all, I would like to say that 'NoWB' is not a hack or patch ... It's just human intelligence versus CPU 'power' 8))

      When the AmigaDOS command 'LoadWb' is executed, the OS starts the GUI mode and runs whatever is on the 'WBstartup' drawer. What my program does when it is used instead of 'LoadWb' is to rename this directory to something else (WBST), and then execute 'LoadWb' -> now the DOS didn't find any program on the 'WBStartup' dir simply because this dir doesn't exists ;)

      Then we wait some seconds and undo the rename thing ... See the supplied source if your interested.
