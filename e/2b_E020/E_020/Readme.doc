    Installation:

    Copy  '020.m' and '020_Procedures' to your 'EModules:Tools' directory.
At the begenning of your program add:

MODULE 'tools/020'

    Description:

    E_020  is a very simple module, which gives you some speed increase on
MC68020+  processors.  It  is only experimental version which has just two
instructions: mul() and div().

c:=mul(a,b)

Same as 32 bit Mul() in E.

c:=div(a,b)

Same as 32 bit Div() in E.

    Please  note,  that 32 bit instructions are much slower then normal 16
bit  operators (* and /). If you operate on 16 bit values, please use this
operators.

    How   fast   are   this  instructions  in  comparison  with  normal  E
instructions? This is some test's results:

Mul() -> 49 seconds
mul() -> 38 seconds
Div() -> 59 seconds
div() -> 47 seconds

    As  you  can  see, speed increase is about 20%. Note that this results
may  be  other for other numbers etc. Test was made on A1200 with Blizzard
III  turbo  card (50Mhz) with ICACHE, DCACHE ON and IBURST and DBURST OFF.
You must check the speed increasment on your machine by yourself.

    Notes:

    Please  use  OPT  020  keyword at the start of your program. Note that
it's  a silly version of 020 and is not really useful yet. Please be ready
for new versions with many faster routines for 020+.

    Contact:

    If  you  made  some  optimised  procedures  in assembler, which can be
useful  with  AmiE  please  send me  it  now!  Since  E  has  no  built-in
optimisation it can be really useful. E-mail:
