What the heck is an "associative array" object?  Basically, it manages a
one-dimensional sparse array of "whatevers", and you can use -anything-
for the index:  signed integers (floats might even work), 8- to 32-bit
characters, strings, objects.  It automatically sorts when you insert
an element, and lookup is FAST, because it uses a binary search on the
array.

So you're no longer constrained to using integer-indexed arrays, and
"whatever"-to-integer mapping functions to compute your indexes, nor are
you limited to using arrays of 100,000 elements just because your first
index is 0 and your highest possible index is 99,999, you only use as
many elements as you need, and ya don't need to quess ahead of time how
many elements you will need since the array is expanded on the fly.
