  Description of Available Methods
  --
  progressbar(text=NIL, units=100, diff=0, txtpen=2, fillpen=3, emptypen=0)

    Initialises the plugin. Parameters are :

    text     - A text displayed inside the bar. You can insert a
               formatstring like '\d percent' here.
    units    - The maximal number of units. For example if you want
               to display percents this could be 100.
    diff     - In order to make display faster you can tell the object
               only to draw certain elements. For example if you count
               very fast from 1 to 100 in the bar and it takes to
               long a diff of 2 will make it faster (and only draw every
               second number).

    emptypen
    fillpen
    textpen  - The pens (colors) used by the bar.

  set(newstate)

    Sets the bar to a new number (the one being given with newstate)
