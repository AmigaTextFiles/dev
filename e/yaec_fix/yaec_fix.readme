short: Fixes stupid archive error in yaec.lha (1.1.1 BETA)
uploader : amigae@swipnet.se
author : amigae@swipnet.se
type : dev/e

   The archive is missing a t-directory.
   To fix this, get into the E: directory
   and type "makedir t" and ENTER. Thats it. Hopefully :)

   Note: The yaec_fix.lha archive contains nothing more
         then this text, so you probably dont need to download it :)
