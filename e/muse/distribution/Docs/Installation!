I assume that you have set up your E compiler environment as per the E docs.

INSTALLATION
   EASY! No program supplied cos it's SOO EASSY!
   short: copy the contents of libs and emodules to their logical counterparts.
   quickest via: workbench

   "Silly" _long_ instructions
   1. Load Workbench!
   2. Find your LIBS: directory and open it so that you can see its window open
      on screen.
   3. Copy the contents of the Libs directory in the distribution to your LIBS:
      directory by selecting the contents and dragging it into the directory.
   4. Find your EMODULES: directory and open it so that you can see its window
      open on screen.
   5. Copy the contents of the emodules directory in the distribution to your
      EMODULES: directory by selecting the contents and dragging it into the
      directory.

Clear??!?!??!?!?!!!!!

That's it!
