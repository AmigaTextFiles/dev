                               ====================

The documents supplied in here are accurate.
FOR THIS VERSION AND THIS VERSION _ONLY_!!!!!!

The functions, options, procedures, constants, facilities etc are liable to
change either minor or major in later revisions!
Be warned!

They _are_ USEFUL however, so it would be wrong for me not to include any docs
on them. Esp since I've used one in one of the example programs!
In short however, YOU USE THEM IN THE CONTEXT YOUR PROGRAM MIGHT NOT COMPILE CORRECTLY
WITH FUTURE VERSIONS OF MUSE!!!!! (but _will_ work - obviously - with this version!)

Share and Enjoy!
