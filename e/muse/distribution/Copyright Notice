This is Muse Release Version 1. All files in this directory and its
subdirectories accompanying this document are copyright 1996 Michael Sparks.

    Although these files are copyright I hereby give anyone who reads this
the right to copy and freely redistibute this files as long as full credit is
given. The only restriction I place is if ANY of the MODULES are redistributed,
then the entire archive must also be redistibuted.

    In the specific case of the address book or the paint programs, if they
are sufficiently modified by any person or persons, then they may be redist-
-ributed in a compiled form only mentioning the fact that they were written
using Muse if and only if the modifier contacts myself (Michael Sparks) and
confirms that this is OK to do. Which is likely if sufficient modifications
have been made.

    You may freely distribute for profit or otherwise any program that you
create using Muse providing I (M.Sparks) have been told and that the docs
supporting the program explicitly mention Muse somewhere.

    Finally, if you use Muse for the creation of any application, you are
required to contact the author (preferably by e-mail or snail-mail) and and
let ME know what you think of it.

    All other copyright rights are totally reserved. I even reserve the right
to rescind any person or person's right to store a copy of Muse on magnetic
media of any kind. Although that right would only be exercised under very
unlikey conditions.


SHORT SHORT VERSION:
   Don't rip me off. Credit me instead.
   USE IT!
   Let me know what you think
   Enjoy!
