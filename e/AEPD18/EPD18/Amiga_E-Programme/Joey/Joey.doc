Welcome to my first E program.
It's a little program I always wanted writing.
No one else wrote one.
Although I'm sure something like NewList could do it.
What it does is to delete .info files.
I want to do this to save disk space.
Maybe you do too.
It s only really useful if you use the CLI.
I only use it on those parts of disks I exclusively use with the CLI.
It is used like this.
Joey <path>.
You must specify a path.
Joey will start looking in that path.
Joey will delete all .info files in that path.
Joey will delete all .info files in sub-dirs of that path.
ad infinitum.
Once they've gone they won't come back.
You'ld have to undelete them.
So be careful.
Disclaimer: It s not my fault.
It's eware.
E-mail me if yer like it.
