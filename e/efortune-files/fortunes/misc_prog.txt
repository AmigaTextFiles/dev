BASIC 
BASIC programmers are paranoid because any 16 year old could do their job, if asked. To try to secure their positions, they deliberately write code using the double-spaghetti method; never using a FOR...NEXT loop where four or five IF...THEN...ELSE constructs might do. Since they taught themselves programming on a ZX81 rigged up to the family telly, they have huge gaps in their computing knowledge. BASIC programmers ring up technical support centres to ask questions like 'What are those funny numbers with letters in them?'

Pascal 
Despite an early reputation for gambling (as in Pascal's bet), these days Pascal programmers are all deadly enthusiastic. They are proud of the ability of their language to define a type representing, for example, different flavours of crisp. This enables them to write useful code where tomato=succ(salt_n_vinegar), and ord(roast_beef)/2>ord(prawn_cocktail). Pascal people all know exactly how programming should be done and enjoy casting their pearls of wisdom among the swine who write in lesser dialects.

FORTRAN 
FORTRAN programmers learned their craft at college in 1935. They are convinced that theirs is the language of the future, pointing out that in 1966 it was selected as the ANSI standard for writing Snoopy calendar programs. FORTRAN programmers are not altogether at ease with modern peripherals such as VDUs (which they refer to as 'glass teletypes'). They are the only people in the programming community to use flowcharts, which they draw with loving care using their special WH Smith stencils. These diagrams are then filed away with the source code, ignored for the life of the program and then finally thrown away unread because even FORTRAN is easier to read than a flowchart.

Assembly Language 
Assembly language programmers are closer to the machine than anybody else, emotionally as well as in programming terms. This symbiosis can be taken too far; programmers who faint when the reset button is pressed should perhaps consider switching to C, or even chartered accountancy. Assembly programmers often pretend to be able to patch their code in hex as they go ('I think you'll find that C4 F2 D1 at offset 24A2 will fix the problem, Nigel'). They manage this by introducing deliberate errors into their programs, pre-assembling the 'patched' result secretly and concealing the results in tiny writing on their shirt cuffs.

C 
Traditionally the C programmer was a bearded bore who would corner you at parties and breathe garlic and Unix all over you. All this has now changed. These days C programmers are clean shaven bores who corner you at parties and breathe lager and OS/2 all over you. They can still be trusted to have a witty quote or two from the Good Book to liven up a dull conversation, such as 'a primary expression follwed by an expression in square brackets is a primary expression'.

Xbase 
Xbase people go red when lesser mortals refer to their language as a 'database' language. They strongly believe that Xbase can do anything a specialist language can do, it might produce a program three times as large and twenty times slower but it can do it. When confronted with a non-believer who has unwittingly entered the world of Xbase they mercililessly perform a frightening ritual known as 'The Boyce Codd Relation Rules'. This has the effect of making the new user re-write his code to conform to these rules and thereby make a perfectly good program constantly crash with 'Target already engaged in relation'. Notwithstanding these faults, it should be noted that some Xbase programmers are incredibly together people, who turn over an honest penny working for Microsoft.

The Pizza Metric
How: Count the number of pizza boxes in the lab.
What: Measures the amount of schedule under-estimation. If people are spending enough after-hours time working on the project that they need to have meals delivered to the office, then there has obviously been a mis-estimation somewhere.
%
The Aspirin Metric
How: Maintain a centrally-located aspirin bottle for use by the team. At the beginning and end of each month, count the number of aspirin remaining aspirin in the bottle.
What: Measures stress suffered by the team during the project. This most likely indicates poor project design in the early phases, which causes over-expenditure of effort later on. In the early phases, high aspirin-usage probably indicates that the product's goals or other parameters were poorly defined.

The Beer Metric
How: Invite the team to a beer bash each Friday. Record the total bar bill.
What: Closely related to the Aspirin Metric, the Beer Metric measures the frustration level of the team. Among other things, this may indicate that the technical challenge is more difficult than anticipated.
%
The Creeping Feature Metric
How: Count the number of features added to the project after the design has been signed off, but that were not requested by any requirements definition.
What: This measures schedule slack. If the team has time to add features that are not necessary, then there was too much time allocated to a schedule task.
%
The "Duck!" Metric
How: This one is tricky, but a likely metric would be to count the number of engineers that leave the room when a marketing person enters. This is only valid after a requirements document has been finalized.
What: Measures the completeness of the initial requirements. If too many requirements changes are made after the product has been designed, then the engineering team will be wary of marketing, for fear of receiving yet another change to a design which met all initial specifications.
%
The Status Report Metric
How: Count the total number of words dedicated to the project in each engineer's status report.
What: This is a simple way to estimate the smoothness with which the project is running. If things are going well, an item will likely read, "I talked to Fred; the widgets are on schedule." If things are not going as well, it will say, "I finally got in touch with Fred after talking to his phone mail for nine days straight. It appears that the widgets will be delayed due to snow in the Ozarks, which will cause the whoozits schedule to be put on hold until widgets arrive. If the whoozits schedule slips by three weeks, then the entire project is in danger of missing the July deadline."
