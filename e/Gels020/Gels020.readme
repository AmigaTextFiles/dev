68020 slows down when Longwords are not 32-bit aligned.  This archive provides an alternative version of the AnimComp structure (abbreviated ac in the graphics/gels.m file) that adds a pad word to the beginning.

Also included is an alternative version of Jason Hulance's RKRM examples with the alignment fix.  Testing has been minimal at this point and the examples assume that you use the E allocation system.
