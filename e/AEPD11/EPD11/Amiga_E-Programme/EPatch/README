Short: First update patch to Amiga E v3.0a
Type: dev/e
Author: Wouter van Oortmerssen (wouter@gene.fwi.uva.nl)

This archive contains the EC v3.0b compilers (demo and registered,
as patches). This is a quick fix of the various bugs that popped up
in v3.0a (bugs were to be expected, as this was such a HUGE update)

Bugs fixed in v3.0b (nearly all were tiny problems, with great consequences!)
- internal errors on 68000 systems
- problems with inherited methods
- modules could have 4 superfluous bytes of code in them
- default arguments in modules could get lost
- method redefinition could cause double declaration errors
- ptr's to <object> in objects in modules would get lost [now ec will
  try to find the correct object, else type = LONG]

Other bugs are being taken care of, but are mostly not that urgent.

The programs 'ecpatch' and 'ecdemopatch' will read 'ec' or 'ecdemo'
in the current dir and output the new v30b.
