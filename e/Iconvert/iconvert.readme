This is just a patched version of "Iconvert" developed with AmigaE3.2a.
The original version converts constants complete to uppercase, the patched
version only makes chars uppercase until the first "_".

This version converts "XPK_InName" (declared in "libraries/xpk.i") to
"XPK_InName" instead of "XPK_INNAME" (just an example! ;)).
