A few small, and almost identical in "layout", E sources for 
Wouter van Oortsmersens excellent AmigaE3.1a compiler.

Written to demonstrate simple use of the "iffparse.library".

These sources are e-mailware - if you find them of any use, send me a
short e-mail message at <vidarh@rforum.no> and tell me you use them
(suggestions for improvements, and questions, are also welcomed).

Please read the sources for additional copyright info.

Have fun,
Vidar Hokstad <vidarh@rforum.no>
