10mins 1.1 - © 14-Mar-1995 by Maik "Blizzer" Schreiber [FREEWARE]
=================================================================

Usage:
------
10mins [-t] <text file> [-v60] [-s <seconds>] [-o <output>] [-nb]


Parameters:
-----------
-t <text file>  specifies the text file to be displayed

-v60            selects a vertical blank frequency of 60 Hz
                (default: 50 Hz)

-s <seconds>    specifies the timeout after which the window should be
                closed
                (default: 600 seconds)

-o <output>     specifies the output
                (default: "RAW:0/203/640/53/Reminder/NOSIZE")

-nb             switches the DisplayBeep() off
                (default: on)


Purpose:
--------
This program opens a RAW: window, displays the desired text and waits until
a timeout or a <Ctrl c>. Then the RAW: window is closed and the program
exits.


Motivation:
-----------
Originally I wrote this program for my own purposes for use with CyberCron.
CyberCron is a very good program to do several things at specified times.
I use the program to do netcalls at several mailboxes automatically (eg. at
night). But when I'm currently online, netcalls won't work. So I wrote this
program. It opens its window 15 minutes before the netcall (to be specified
within CyberCron). When I'm on the computer I can close the window by
pressing <Ctrl c>. When not, the program exits itself after 10 minutes (to
be specified in the sourcecode).

My text files contain something like this:

--- >>> --------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTENTION: netcall at <mailbox> at <time> !! 15 minutes left !
Please shut down all modem activity down quickly !
--- <<< --------------------------------------------------------------------

The text I'm really using is in German, of course ;-).


Here's another example for the use of 10mins:

When a user wants to become a registered user of a mailbox, he often must
state his birthday. The sysop can now configure CyberCron which runs 10mins
which displays a text like: "Send a 'Happy birthday !' mail to <user> !!".
Or let it be even your own birthday !
