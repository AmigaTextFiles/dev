                                @{b}OVERVIEW@{ub}

  GTXConv is an utility to generate AmigaE source from GUI file created
  using GadToolsBox 2.0+. Is remotely (very remotley) based upon SrcGen.
  Some of GTXConv highlights:
  
  * has a user-friendly fully multitasking GUI
  * generate code compilable or only desired routines
  * generated code is compatible with AmigaE v2.1b and v3.x
  * is fully configurable
  * not much memory is needed
  * handles all tags, idcmps, flags, gadgets etc. etc.
  * handles custom, public or workbench screens
  * generate font-sensitive code
  * can read PowerPacked GUIs
  * can use system or text font when genrating font-sensitie source
  * checkbox may be made resizable under v39 as long as radio gadgets
  * the NewLook can be used for menus
  * fully keyboard support
  * write IDCMP and flags as hex numbers or as keyword


  This program was fully written using AmigaE v2.1b. Currently I'm
  planning to:

  * create full-multitasking generated code
  * localize GTXConv
  * indent generated code
  * add tags missed in this version...
  * more & more... 
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE FOR 1.3 USERS: since 1.1 version GTXConv is v37+ only compatible
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ because none of registered users was interested in
  1.3 code and some feature of GTXConv are v37+ only. If you want a 1.3
  compatible version of GTXConv ask me for the 1.0 version

@NODE "register" "How to become a GTXConv registered user"
@TOC "MAIN"

                            @{b}HOW TO REGISTER@{ub}

  As stated before this program is SHAREWARE. From version 1.3 GTXConv is
  released uncrippled. Only a boring requester is enabled in the demo
  version when you enter or exit from GTXConv. You can become a registered
  user in three way:

  - @{b}USER@{ub}
     registration fee in FREE; only send the regform completed in all its
     parts via e-mail. You will receive a @{"key" LINK "keyfile"} that will disable the boring
     requester. The USER key is only valid for the version of the program
     you registered. To obtain other version without noising requesters
     you'll have to register each version. The registered version in fully
     functional. If you don't own an e-mail address you can't register
     as USER (because of high snail mail expenses).

  - @{b}SUPPORTER@{ub}
     as before but you must pay a regfee (see table). You will assure all
     future versions at your home via snail-mail or via e-mail. Please
     complete the regform, put it into a envelope with the sum of money
     required and send it to my address.

  - @{b}DEVELOPER@{ub}
     as SUPPORTER but the regfee is higher (see table) and you will assure
     the GTXConv code too. The GTXConv code is not freely distributable but
     provided only for developing purposes. However the DEVELOPER
     registered user can use some of GTXConv routines in its own program.

     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
     |  Type          E-Mail    Snail-Mail    Registering you'll get...  |

     |  DEVELOPER      50DM        55DM       All future versions & code |
     +-------------------------------------------------------------------+

  To register please send @{"the regform" LINK "regform"} compiled in all its parts with cash
  (if required; no coins, please) in a close envelope to the address below
  (please control that is the same reported in the main program, clicking
  Info). You are encouraged to send Deutsch Marks, but you can also send an
  equivalent sum in your currency. Obviously if you want to register as
  USER money is not required. This is my address:

                            @{b}THE KEYFILE@{ub}

  If you register you will receive a keyfile that will disable the boring
  requester when entering/exiting form GTXConv. This keyfile contains your
  personal data (like name, surname, address, regcode, type of registration,
  etc.) encrypted. The USER keyfile is valid only for the current version.
  This keyfile must be placed in the L: directory.

  NOTE: don't modify the keyfile, since this may cause system instability
        and/or system/hardware damages. The same thing could happen if you
        substitute ths keyfile with another file.

  You can obtain a FREE SUPPORTER REGISTRATION if you contribute to the
  development of GTXConv. For instance if you:

  - translate in your own language this document
  - send to me examples of E code to add to GTXConv
  - provide three (3) new DEVELOPER registered users along with your
    registration request.

  Please contact me before starting in a work: maybe somebody else has
  already done it before you. In any case you must always send via snail-mail
  the regform completed in all its parts (without money, of course). When I
  receive the regform I will send you the GTXConv SUPPORTER keyfile.
  But, hey, don't miss to send me your work... ;)

@NODE "required" "Hardware and software requirements"
@TOC "MAIN"

                     @{b}SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS@{ub}

  To run GTXConv, you need an Amiga v37+ (WB2.04+) and these libraries
  must be present in LIBS::
  
     diskfont.library v37+    (required, WB library)
     reqtools.library v37+    (required, supplied)
     gadtools.library v37+    (required, on most Amiga in ROM)
     powerpacker.library v35+ (optional, supplied)
     keymap.library v37+      (required, on most Amiga in ROM)
     utility.library v37+     (required, WB library)
      
  If also powerpacker.library is present, GTXConv is able to load GUIs
  packed with PowerPacker of Nico Francois. GTXConv uses for its own
  code about 50k of memory: generally when converting large GUIs, 100k
  are needed (not much, isn't it?:). The module 'boopsi.m' must be placed
  in your EMODULES: drawer if you want to manage @{"GETFILE gadgets" LINK "getfile"}.
  Since GTXConv saves its configuration in S: (or in SYS: if S: is not
  present) this device must be write enabled.
  
  GTXConv has been tested under:
  
  - A1200, OS39, WB3.0, 2MB CHIP, 540M HD Seagate 3,5", 3 buttons mouse :)
  - A500+, OS37, WB2.04, 1MB CHIP, NO HD,
  - A500,  OS40, WB3.1, 512K CHIP, 2Mb FAST, NO HD
  
  If you get into troubles please mail-me sending the detailed bug and your
  full configuration.

  NOTE FOR ENFORCER FANS: it seems to be two Enforcer hits while loading
    the GUI data. I think that they were caused by two AddTail() functions
    (removing they the hits disappear) but nothing is wrong... bah...
    If you can explain me the reason please do it!

@ENDNODE

@NODE "Tags" "Technical informations"

                             @{b}TECHINCAL INFOS@{ub}

  All tags, idcmps, flags, gadgets (yes, GETFILE type too!) are supported.
  Therefore not all v39+ tags are supported by GTXConv since they are not
  supported neither by GadToolsBox. If some tag is not present, they will
  be added in a future version.
  
  Please make attention to ListView gadgets: they are generated but labels
  and string gadget are not supported (GTLV_LABELS and GTLV_SHOWSELECTED are
  present on generated code but with NIL argument). This is not a my fault
  but of GadToolsBox: you can't select the string gadget for the listview
  and the autodoc is very bugged!! I will patch this work in a future 
  (very future) version. Therefore if you want assign a string gadget to
  a Listview, simply replace the NIL argument of GTLV_SHOWSELECTED
  with the label of the string gadget you wish to assign. Simple, isn't it?
  If you don't know how to handle a ListView gadget, please read the
  "gtlv.e" example in the AmigaE distribution: it's very intersting!

@TOC "MAIN"

                          @{b}THE GETFILE GADGET@{ub}

  Since 1.3 version, GTXConv is able to manage the GETFILE gadget! This
  gadget is not a normal one, but a boopsi gadget, a gadget not created
  automatically by GadTools. In order to create this gadget you must
  provide a dispatcher and the gadget image. All this things are performed
  by the 'boopsi.m' module included in the main GTXConv archive. This
  module can not be read by AmigaE v2.1b, so the GETFILE gadget is an
  Amiga V3 only feature. But not despair, I'm developing a code AmigaE v2
  compatible too. To use the GETFILE gadget you must copy the 'boopsi.m'
  in your EMODULES: dir. That's all! But remember that this gadget is
  not font-sensitive, so please don't use the @{"fontsensitive code" LINK "prefgad" 57}
  option if in your GUI there is a GETFILE. Finally the GETFILE code
  needs 'utility.library' v37+ to be present in your LIBS: drawer. Since
  this one is a system library, should not be a problem...
@ENDNODE

@NODE "IDCMP" "IDCMP handling"
@TOC "MAIN"

                        @{b}IDCMP HANDLINGs@{ub}

  When the "IDCMP procedures" flag is on, GTXConv generates some procedures
  in order to handle window events. When an event is detected a routine like
  this below search through the IDCMP allowed for that window, for the
  matching one and then start an appropriate routine. The general routine
  should be like this:

  SELECT class
    CASE IDCMP_GADGETUP
      id:=code.gadgetid
      handle_<windowname>_gadgets(id)
    CASE IDCMP_MENUPICK
      /* some code here.... */
      handle_<windowname>_menus(menu,item,subitem)
    CASE IDCMP_REFRESWINDOW
      refresh_<windowname>_window()
    CASE IDCMP_VANILLAKEY
      /* not supported yet */
    CASE ....
  ENDSELECT

  Not all the IDCMP are supported. The most important are IDCMP_GADGETUP,
  IDCMP_GADGETDOWN (like the previous one), IDCMP_MENUPICK. For those IDCMP
  GTXConv create respectively some routine for handle gadgets or menu.

  @{"handle_<windowname>_gadget()" link "handgad"}
  @{"handle_<windowname>_menu()" link "handmenu"}  

  IDCMPs actually not supported  are  marked with /* not supported yet */.
  A specific routine routine for these IDCMPs will be added in a future
  version (is a work very long and boring...).

  NOTE: if you don't know what IDCMPs are you should really read a specific
        Amiga book like The Guru Book, The Rom Kernel Manual or refere to
        the includes and autodocs released by Amiga Tech.

@NODE "handgad" "Function to handle gadget events"
@TOC "IDCMP"

  -------------------------------
  @{b}handle_<windowname>_gadgets(id)@{ub}
  -------------------------------
  This procedure is used for IDCMP_GADGETUP and IDCMP_GADGETDOWN. It receives
  as argument the id of the pressed gadget. Here an example of this routine:

   PROC  handle_<windowname>_gadgets(id)
      SELECT id
         CASE GA_GADGET1
         CASE GA_GADGET2
         CASE GA_GADGET3
         ....
      ENDSELECT
   ENDPROC

  Between a CASE and another you must place the code to handle the gadget.
  I suggest you to insert function call instead of code between previous
  CASE, this will make your life easier when modifing the GUI. Example:

   PROC  handle_<windowname>_gadgets(id)
      SELECT id
         CASE GA_GADGET1
            gadget1_<windowname>()
         CASE GA_GADGET2

  menu: indicates the menu selected, starting from 1 for the most left,
        2 for the right one, etc.
  item: indicates the item selected in menu, starting from 1 for the top,

  Since version 1.1, GTXConv generates the routine to open/close the screen
  in which your windows will be placed. All GadToolsBox screen types are
  supported (custom, public, wb). The generated screen has the selected
  dripens, palette etc.

                             @{b}FONT-SENSITIVE CODE@{ub}

  Since version 1.1, a function to make generated code font-sensitive has
  been introducted. The procedures have been converted from GadToolsBox
  ones (obviously those in C...) and the author doesn't assure a perfect
  functionality with all fonts, particulary with the bigger ones. I
  tested the routines with all my own fonts and, excluding some cases,
  all went right. Actually a computefont() procedure will be created along 
  as cx() and cy() that calculate the new x and y values. Please don't use
  yourself this routines: they are private to GTXConv! The gui will scan 
  the screen (or system) font and will resize itself in relation with 
  the x and y dimensions of the font. If the font is too large and the 
  resulting window does't fit the screen the old 'topaz 8' is used. 

  Please pay attention to those gadget non resizable, like getfile, mx,
  checkbox, if you are under Amiga pre-V39 or you haven't selected the
  flag to make them @{"scalable" LINK "prefgad" 80}. GTXConv itself has been made font-sensitive
  and uses the system default font instead of screen default font.
 
  The font-sensitive code may be of two types: selecting the @{"font-sensitive" LINK "prefgad" 57}
  function but not the @{"system font" LINK "prefgad" 63} one, created windows will use the
  screen default font. Instead, selecting the @{"system font" LINK "prefgad" 63} function too, 
  windows will use the default system font for grafical operation (but
  not for its own dragbar). The difference is not big, but remember that
  screen fonts can be proportional and system ones not, so these are
  safer. Obviously the @{"system font" LINK "prefgad" 63} function can be enabled only if
  the gui is @{"font sensitive" LINK "prefgad" 57}.

  First run GTXConv :) the main window will appear. Then you must have a
  GUI file created by GadToolsBox 2.0+ to convert. Click on "Load GUI"
  and with the filerequester select the desired GUI. Wait for loading and
  conversion: if all went right the "Save E Source" gadget will allow 
  you to save the converted source. Using the requester pick the name 
  for the converted E source. That's all folks!
  Naturally you can select some options for the conversion; you can find
  a description for every gadget functions in this two chapters:

  @{" Main window        " link "mainwnd"}
  @{" Preferences window " link "prefwnd"}

  All gadgets have key-shortcut (the character over the '_'). Shortcuts
  are accepted only if window is active (obviously...) and also with
  SHIFT key pressed. So pressing 'l' or SHIFT+'l' will open the load
  file-requester. The main and preferences GUIs of GTXConv are totally
  font-sensitive.

  @{" SAVE E SOURCE " link "maingad" 12} save generated code
  @{" INFO          " link "maingad" 26} infos about the program & the author
  @{" PREFERENCES   " link "maingad" 31} open the preferences window
  @{" QUIT          " link "maingad" 38} terminate GTXConv

  Below those gadgets you can see some infos on the registered user 
  (or UNREGISTERED if you are not registered: do it, it may be free!!) and
  the status line, in two text gadgets. From version 1.2 preferences may be
  setted on a different @{"window" LINK prefwnd}.

  @{b}- LOAD GUI@{ub}
     opens a filerequester to choose the GUI file to be converted. If in 
     your LIBS: drawer powerpacker.library is present, you can load also
     GUIs packed with PowerPacker. Encrypted GUIs are not supported: 
     please, first decrypt them with PowerPacker. The default directory
     where GTXConv will search GUIs can be set in the @{"preference window" LINK "prefwnd"}.

     WARNING: when you load a GUIs, the previous in memory will be lost!
    

  @{b}- SAVE E SOURCE@{ub}
     when a GUI file is read, you can save it as E source clicking on
     this gadget. A file requester will appear. The suggested filename
     is the same of the loaded GUI but with a final ".e" istead of ".gui".
     Obviously you can change the name as you want! An overwriting check 
     is made. You can set the default directory for E source in the
     @{"preferences window" LINK "prefwnd"}.

     WARNING: when the source is saved, the GUI is removed from memory,
              excluding when you stop the operation clicking 'Cancel'
              in the requester o an error occurs.



  @{b}- INFO@{ub}
     some infos about the program, the author and about the user. 
     Very useful... :)

  
  @{b}- PREFERENCES@{ub}
     will open the @{"preferences window" LINK "prefwnd"}. The @{"main window" LINK "mainwnd"} will be fully 
     usable also when preferences window is open since GTXConv is fully 
     multitasking (I'm planning to add this feature to the generated 
     code too...).


  @{b}- QUIT@{ub}
     clicking on this gadget will end GTXConv. You must confirm this action
     when a requester appear. The same action can be made using the 
     closewindow gadget.

                         @{b}THE PREFERENCES WINDOW@{ub}

  In this window you can choose between some options for GTXConv and for
  the converted source. Here the full description of every gadgets:

  @{" GUI PATH            " link "prefgad" 2} sets the GUIs directory 
  @{" SRCPATH             " link "prefgad" 10} sets the Amiga E sources directory
  @{" SAVE PREFS          " link "prefgad" 16} saves prefernces
  @{" USE                 " link "prefgad" 23} uses preferences
  @{" CANCEL              " link "prefgad" 29} discards modified preferences
  @{" MAIN PROCEDURE      " link "prefgad" 34} writes main() procedures
  @{" IDCMP PROCEDURES    " link "prefgad" 41} writes IDCMPs procedures
  @{" LIBRARY PROCEDURES  " link "prefgad" 46} writes open/close libraries procedures
  @{" MESSAGE PROCEDURES  " link "prefgad" 51} writes message procedures
  @{" CODE FONT-SENSITIVE " link "prefgad" 57} make the source font-sensitive
  @{" USE SYSTEM FONT     " link "prefgad" 63} uses the system font instead of screen font
  @{" SHOW IDCMP & FLAGS  " link "prefgad" 71} shows IDCMP & flags using keywords
  @{" SCALED CHECKBOX     " link "prefgad" 80} makes checkbox resizable
  @{" SCALED RADIO        " link "prefgad" 89} makes radio gadgets resizable
  @{" NEWLOOK MENUS       " link "prefgad" 94} uses newlook for menus
@ENDNODE

@NODE "prefgad" "Preferences window gadgets description"
@TOC "prefwnd"

  @{b}- GUI PATH@{ub}
     this gadget will open a file requester to choose the default dir where
     GTXConv will search for the GadToolsBox GUIs whenever you select the
     @{"load function" LINK "maingad" 2}. The path selected will be displayed on the string 
     gadget on the left; you can also use this string gadget in order to 
     modify path without using file requesters.


  @{b}- SRC PATH@{ub}
     same as above but this gadget will set the path for E sources instead
     of GUIs. This path will be used when saving generated code. As above
     you can use string gadget to modify the path without filerequesters.


  @{b}- SAVE PREFS@{ub}
     if you are satisfied with your choices, and want to save them
     permanently then click on this gadget. A file in S: will be created
     with all prefs setted and this will be read whenever you enter in
     GTXConv: in this way you don't have to set everytime the preferences.


  @{b}- USE@{ub}
     this gadget will set your preferences changes but these will not be
     saved into the preferences file. So if you quit the program, the 
     changes will be lost.


  @{b}- CANCEL@{ub}
     if you don't want to use changes made to preferences simply click this
     gadget, prevoius preferences will be restored and changes discarded.


  @{b}- MAIN PROCEDURE@{ub}
     if selected will cause writing of an example main() procedure in the
     E source. This proc will open the first converted window. When the
     user presses the closegadget of this window the second window will 
     be open and so on. When the last is reached all windows will be closed.


  @{b}- IDCMP PROCEDURES@{ub}
     if selected every windows will be checked for their idcmps and a 
     procedure will manage these idcmps. See @{"IDCMP chapter" LINK "IDCMP"} for more infos.


  @{b}- LIBRARY PROCEDURES@{ub}
     if selected will add to E source openlibs() and closelibs() procs
     in order to open all required libraries and then close them.


  @{b}- MESSAGE PROCEDURES@{ub}
     if selected will write on E source a procedure called wait4message()
     that will manage events and messages for windows. Also a message
     handler for every window is created.


  @{b}- CODE FONTSENSITIVE@{ub}
     the resulting code will be @{"font-sensitive" LINK "fontsens"} if this gadget is selected.
     Then you may select the standard gadget to be used for GUI 
     selecting or not the @{"Use system font" LINK "prefgad" 63} function.


  @{b}- USE SYSTEM FONT@{ub}
     if your code is @{"font-sensitive" LINK "fontsens"} you can select to use for your GUI
     the screen font or system font setted by Workbench preferences.
     System fonts are safer because they are no proportional, therefore
     some programmers may like to use default screen font. If this flag
     is setted your resulting GUI will use default system font. In order
     to use this option @{"Code fontsensitive" LINK "prefgad" 57}  must be selected!

  @{b}- SHOW IDCMP & FLAGS@{ub}
     some GTXConv users complained of the 'unreadable' hex numbers for
     the window IDCMP and flags. From this version you can select to
     make IDCMP and flags written clearly using keywords. For instance
     for idcmp will be used IDCMP_GADGETUP+IDCMP_RAWKEY+... instead
     of $E04 number. For the compiler the two resulting codes are
     identical!! Added only for programmers comfort... :)


  @{b}- SCALED CHECKBOX@{ub}
     since GadToolsBox doesn't handle all v39+ feature, GTXConv gives you
     the opportunity to make all your checkbox gadgets resizable: checkboxes
     will use the font height and width instead of fixed dimensions 14x20
     pixels. Remeber that this feature is only avalable from v39: under
     older Amigas this will be ignored and the resulting gadgets will be
     14x20 pixels.


  @{b}- SCALED RADIO@{ub}
     as @{"scaled checkbox" LINK "prefgad" 80}, but affects radio gadgets (mx, mutual exclude,
     name them as you want!).


  @{B}- USE NEWLOOK MENUS@{ub}
     you are bored by the poor look of your menus? Well, you can set this
     flag and menus will use the NewLook under v39+. Background will be
     white, text black and a better imagery for Amiga key will be used.
     Under pre-v39 Amigas this flag is ignored.

  GTXConv has been created using AmigaE v2.1b on an Amiga 1200 equipped with
  2Mb CHIP / 8Mb FAST RAM, a 540Mb 3,5" Seagate HardDisk, a TQM 68030/50
  accelerator board and with the help of the E Development Interface
  (© Bugada Andrea), the E Pre Processor (© Barry Wills). The author of
  GTXConv (ME :) is a poor student attending second year of Computer and
  Automation Engineering at Politecnico of Turin. Feel free to contact me
