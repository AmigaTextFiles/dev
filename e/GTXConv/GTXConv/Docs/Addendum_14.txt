                     ---------------------------
                     ADDENDUM TO THE MAIN MANUAL
                     ---------------------------

PLEASE NOTE WELL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The documentation referes to 1.3 version. Since I had no time to write
a complete documentation for v1.4 and since differences between 1.3 and
1.4 was not so important, I decided only to add this addendum to the
main manual.

GTXConv now is localized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GTXConv now reads standard catalogs, but only if you own an Amiga 2.1+
and the "locale.library" is properly installed. If you want you can copy
catalogs directory to LOCALE:, but this is not suggested, because GTXConv
tries to read the catalogs also in PROGDIR: (i.e. the directory where you
installed GTXConv).
If your language is not present please translate the GTXConv.ct file and
send me it. In this file you can find all the string used by GTXConv in
the English version (built-in language). Simply translate the sentences
in the space between each other, making attention to not modify other
parts of the GTXConv.ct. You can find this file in the catalogs dir.
Then use CatComp or FlexCat to compile it. Remeber to send me the
GTXConv.ct and/or the compiled catalog for inclusion in a future
version of GTXConv.
Please pay attention to shortcuts: in a window two gadget cannot have the
same shortcut. If your catalog is mistaken GTXConv will display an
error message, so you will be able to find easily the double shortcut.


Will never GTXConv localize the generated source?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Probably not! This because to localize a program they are needed the
catalog description and the catalog translation. Since GTXConv cannot
know the strings that you will add to your program, it probally will
never be able to make a localized source. But never despair: it's very
simple to localize your program if you use FlexCat instead of CatComp.
FlexCat not only create the compiled catalog, but also the module to
link to your program. Remember that in AmigaE the messages indentifiers
must be LOWERCASE!! Read the Flexcat documentation for further infos.
As soon as possible I will show the procedure step by step in the
GTXConv manual.
