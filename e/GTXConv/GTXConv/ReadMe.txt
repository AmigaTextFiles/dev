GTXConv 1.4 Installer Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install the program simply double click the 'Install' icon.

The installer script will copy needed libraries in LIBS: and the 'boopsi.m'
module into EMODULES:. Please make sure that either LIBS: that EMODULES:
assigns exist. After copying the script will remove the unnecessary data
from the GTXConv directory.
