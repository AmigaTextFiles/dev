Hello Folks :))

This is my (DMX) convertion of GTLayout for PowerD. If you wanna use it, just simply copy
the contents of the modules drawer to D:modules. There are also 2 small example programs included,
which I put in the examples drawer. Check it out :))

Thanks to Martin Kuchinka for making PowerD and for a lot of help, making GTLayout work with PowerD.
