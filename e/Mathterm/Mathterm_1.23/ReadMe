Mathterm is an E-OBJECT that allows computing terms as
'sin(x)+pi/2' at runtime, i. e. all you have to do, is to supply
the engine with a string as given above, declare some variables,
set them to appropriate values and then start computing the whole
thing. Some features are

- large set of built-in functions (sin, cos, tan, abs, exp...)
- any number of variables
- you may add new functions using the built-in ones at runtime
- elaborate OO-interface


Installation:

Simply doubleclick "Compile_Modules" to compile the modules and
place them into EModules:tools. Afterwards you should be able
to compile the demos. Be aware: you *need* EC registered in
order to compile anything, sources are included solely.

Have fun!
