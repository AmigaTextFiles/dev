This is the developer kit for CAMD v37.1, as found on the
Amiga Developer CD v1.1, converted for use with E.

The original examples and documentation are NOT included.

CAMD is a MIDI driver system, basically each application
has MIDI ports so they can be linked together like studio
boxes, and also hardware (like the serial port) can be
shared.  No more turning off MIDI in one program before
being able to turn it on in another.

Some new (simple) example programs are included:

cha_monitor <name>
    Dump MIDI data to the shell window, <name> is a MIDI
    node (for example, in.0 or out.0 to monitor either
    main input or output).  SysEx data up to 16 kB is
    recognised, the data itself is not displayed but the
    length of the data is.  All output is hexadecimal.
    Ctrl-C quits.

cha_keyboard <name>
    Send MIDI data to the node <name>, the main part of
    the keyboard plays notes, the function keys change
    octave, and the space bar stops all notes (because
    sometimes Intuition forgets key-up events).
