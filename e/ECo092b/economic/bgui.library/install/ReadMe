The installation  scripts  provided  here  all need C= it's Installer utility.
Installer  is   copyrighted   software  and  therefore  not  included  in this
package.

When you  are  running  Kickstart  2.1  or  higher you will find the Installer
utility on  the  Workbench  installation  disk. Copy the Installer anywhere in
your command path to use the installation scripts.

The installation script for Workbench 2.0 will simply install the bgui.library
to  the  directory  of  your choice. The Workbench 2.1+ scripts will also give
you the oppertunity to install the catalog files for your preferred languages.
Please note  that  the  2.1+  scripts are not all translated so it is possible
that the  texts  appear  in  english.  The  catalog  files however will always
contain the desired language.
