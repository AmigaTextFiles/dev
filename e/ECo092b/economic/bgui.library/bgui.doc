`BGUI' release 1.1b,  	(C) Copyright 1993-1994 Jaba Development. 
			All rights reserved.

Requirements
************

   `BGUI' requires at least version 2.04 of the operating system. 
   `BGUI' also requires the following disk-based libraries to operate:

   * gadtools.library          (V37)   (menus)
   * asl.library               (V37)   (filereq class)
   * commodities.library       (V37)   (commodities class)

   The following libraries are not required but they will impose on the
   functionality of the library when not available:

   * locale.library            (V38)   (localized library strings)
   * amigaguide.library        (V37)   (On-line help)
   * workbench.library         (V37)   (App-window support)

   It should not be a problem to use BGUI on a system with 512KByte but a
   minimum of 1 Megabyte is suggested as a minimum.


Keyboard & Mouse
****************

   Most of the BGUI gadget objects can be controlled by the keyboard. Usually
the key that is used to control an object is shown by an underlined character
in the object it's label. The objects can be controlled as follows:

   * `Button' - Pressing the key will make the object appear pressed. If you
     release the key the object appears normal again and the application is
     signalled that the object was selected. When you accidentally activated
     the button you can press SHIFT or ESC before releasing the key to cancel
     the selection.

   * `Toggle Button' - Pressing the key will toggle the selected state of the
     toggle button.

   * `CheckBox' - Pressing the key will toggle the selected state of the
     checkbox object.

   * `Prop (Scroller)' - Pressing the key will advance the knob position by
     one page. When you press the key together with SHIFT the knob will backup
     one page. You can reset the knob position when you are dragging the knob
     with the mouse by clicking on the right mouse button.

   * `Listview' - Pressing the key will select the next entry in the list
     scrolling the entries when necessary. Pressing the key together with
     SHIFT will select the previous entry. Read only listview objects will
     simply scroll the list forward and backward.

   * `Cycle' - Pressing the key will cycle one choise forward. Pressing the
     key together with SHIFT will cycle one choise backward. Selecting the
     gadget with the mouse while holding down the SHIFT key will also make the
     gadget cycle backward. When the cycle gadget was setup to be a popup
     gadget by the application programmer you can click inside the label area
     to pop-up a menu from which you can select the desired item. You can
     recognize a popup gadget by the imagery left of the label area. Normal
     cycle gadgets have a circular arrow here and popup gadgets have a small
     menu here.

   * `Slider' - Pressing the key will advance the knob position by one.
     Pressing the key together with shift will decrease the knob position by
     one. You can reset the knob position when you are dragging the knob with
     the mouse by clicking to on the right mouse button.

   * `String,Integer' - Pressing the key will simply activate the gadget.

   * `Mx' - Pressing the key will select the next button skipping any disabled
     buttons. Pressing the key together with shift will select the previous
     button skipping any disabled buttons. If the Mx object is in tabs mode
     the choises will not stop at the last or first selection but instead it
     will cycle back to the start or the end.
