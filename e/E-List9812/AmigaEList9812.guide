  @{fg shine} Introduction @{fg text}

  Here you'll find all the messages appeared on Amiga E Mailing list
  in December 1998.

  This is the first version of the message log done in Amiga Guide.

  I have just written a little program to do this, as soon as I can
  create some comments, I'll release it in the public domain.

  The best way of reading this guide is to choose an argument 
  (ie. a subject of a message) and then browse it using the "Previous" and "Next"
  gadget in the MultiView/AmigaGuide viewer.

Actually the compiler is so fast because E is a typeless language. The
compiler
doesn't have to check if arguments to functions or operators have the right
type, if an implicit conversion is necessary or not, etc.
A compiler written in C with FLEX and YACC and a good optimising compiler
will
not be that much slower. Of course you will have to optimise your C code
than.

Staf.

gcc is probably the best codegenerator as long as you dont go wild on
systemcalls,
since it will put all arguments on the stack, but the collective experience
of
680x0 that the gcc guys have is hard to beat. Really.

The reason for the size is that "printf" will support all funky modes like
printing formatted strings ("my name is: %s age: %d") and so on. That is why
it takes 2k for hello world. You probably get stack-extension in the binary
also.

If you link against libnix (small startup code) and use PutStr() (whatever
its
name is) from dos.library, you end up with lots smaller files.

On a fast computer, maybe. But on normal machines, E gives even the
assemblers
a good race for their money. C compilers aren't in with a chance.

A speed optimised FLEX/YACC parser won't differ much in speed. It is true
that
the E syntax allows for a speedy parser but that also counts for a parser in
C.

These features can also be included in a C program and yes leaving out the
intermediate step of assembly or other intermediate languages gives also a
big
improvement.

I think you missed the point here. What I wanted to say was that an E
compiler
written in C can be almost as fast as an E compiler written in asm on the
same
machine if it is written with speed in mind and compiled by a good
optimising
compiler.

I use a toolbar that sends Arexx commands to my text editor. I have
buttons to compile, compile with debug info, run EDBG on the current file
or use autobuild which is going to compile automatically all the project.

This is completely done for the tet editor screen, no need to swap to the
wb one, no need to edit any script for every source code. All result are
going to show on the text editor screen as well. I can also open/quit
Enforcer, shells or wahtever always from my toolbar just by pressing the
right button. Not a complete programming envinroment, but quite similar
and all done by me... (that's the most beautiful thing 8) ).

This is why I said:

I agree with you, but You can be the most Brilliant programmer Ever and JAVA
will
still NEVER be fast ;-)  (I'm not saying that because your HW screams that
JAVA will
be responsive... I mean that relatively speaking, Java and Asm are at
different
speeds levels)

It's always fun to be debating philosophy with fellow programmers... :)

Not neccesarily. As you can see with the PPC, processors are more and more
being tuned to give best performance to compiler output and not waste time
by allowing 'tricks' which humans use to get better performance than a
highly optimising compiler wants to give! If you were a programming the
Java chip, your code would probably run not much faster than the compiler's
output for the same thing.

Yeah but the JAVA CHIP would views byte code as if it was a machine
opcode... its
simply a high-level CISC CPU/Interpreter...

I agree with you though that ASM is not a cure for all booboos, since some
programming tricks actually slow down modern CPUs... Because they use branch
predictions and stuff like that.  The CPU will be ready when a dumb
operation
occurs but can be caught off-guard when a pretty smart code arrives. this
can slow
it down.  But I think these cpu optimisations will affect database
management and
heavy datastructure useage more than math-based ops...

Hmm... Yep. In my example above the gcc exec file is ~3 times larger. Isn't
so much. But what if *all* your exec files were, lets say "only" 20%, times
larger. Whoosh! Say goodbye to several megabytes...

Personally I'd prefer "Quake" to be smaller in size /and/ faster than the

Subject: StackSwap (fwd)

I'm trying to swap the stack of my program.
The problem is that I don't know what the 'pointer'-field is supposed to
keep. As I understand, the 'lower' and 'upper'-fields is the pointers to
the lower and upper addresses of my allocated memoryblock.

I've tried this:

PROC main()
 DEF x, stack:stackswapstruct
 IF x:=New(64000)
  stack.lower:=x
  stack.upper:=x+64000
  stack.pointer:=x+64000
  StackSwap(stack)
  -> code..
  -> ..
  StackSwap(stack)
 ENDIF
ENDPROC

This works sometimes, which means that somthing is wrong (I guess the
'pointer') but I'm not sure!

...Kind regards...

I never lost one second with thinking about the stack of my programs -> I
don't know much about stack. But E hasn't a "normal" stack (e.g. programs
which watch the stack usage fail on e-program because of the "strange"
stack). I suppose that because of that your prog sometimes works and
sometimes fails. Somewhere in the E distribution is a module with some
function in it, which fixes the E stack, (perhaps) then work program works.
If this module (sorry, I don't know the name in the moment) is not in the
e-archive, then it is available in Aminet !

You can't expect anything to work for the program with an empty stack! You
*must* copy the old one to the new one. And also the .pointer should point
to
where you want to be after StackSwap() return. That is to x+64000-usedstack.
Unfortunetely you can't find out how much of the stack is used in E, since
the
tc.spupper and tc.splower are not setup currectly.

But why do you need to swap the stack?
OPT STACK=64000
should work just fine. And if you spawn child-processes they are given their
own stack by CreateNewProc()..

Ok, that explains most of it!  Thanx!
I guess the only way of of this is CreateNewProc() then (as the purpose o=

Hmm.. OK.  I took a look at the .upper, lower. and .pointer fields with
WriteF() during the program and I thought it looked really strange..! The
.pointer didn't make any sense.
So why does E has such a strange stack then..?

I was hoping I wouldn't have to use CreateNewProc() (even though I know how
to..)!

AFAIK, it is used when you send commands and do no require any return
value (both result1 and result2).

In my Arexx Handler for BED I use both RXFF_RESULT e RXCOMM. The first is
used to get the port to send the command which is sent as RXCOMM.

Subject: Writing a new E compiler

Hey guys,

    I've followed the discussion about writing a newer compiler
    for E and I've wondered because somebody has said that it is
    neccessary to write the compiler in C++. I think that this
    is a very bad begin because E will be limited to the restrictions
    of C++ and it will contain the disadvantages coming with this
    boring language. The only thing we need to do is to write
    the compiler in E. While doing that we should take care of
    keeping the codegenerator aparted from the parser and
    symbolanalyser. After having a full working E compiler written
    in E we could change the codegenerator so it could generate
    code for PowerPC, Intel machines etc. This would be a way
    to make the compiler portabel and I think this way has a good
    chance to stay in concurrence to the GNU project.

This is wrong. Any language that can save binary files can output a compi=

I think the point is that it would be 'easy' to write a translator for E
into
another language, which already has a compiler (like Fortran and Pascal on
UNIX
machines do), and it would be 'very hard' to write a brand new compiler with
direct output just for E, especially if it was meant to be portable. Have
you
seen the _size_ of GCC? That's just to compile a simple language like C.

So, do you write a translator and try not to lose E language features, or do
you write a compiler from scratch?

You can say that C++ is boring (and you are right!) but you have to admit
that
there's nothing more powerful than C++: even E gets the most of its
characteristics from this language.
Think 'bout:

1) OBJECT ("class" in C++, not the easy "struct" of ANSI C)
2) exception handlers
3) StrCopy,StrAdd (equal to "strcpy()" and "strcat")

and many other things...

E wasn't created for multiple platforms, otherwise it won't had so little
proprietary functions like PutInt(),ReadInt().
ANSI C was created for this: as a matter of fact, there are several standard
includes which do the same thing on different machines (malloc works in the
same way on every computer!)

What? We are going to write an E compiler. E is not a typed language. If we
write it in E, nothing is typed. Where is this typed language you are

I think that a more typed language will help in preserving memory. I'd like
to
add just some other types such as

I can see that this new project FreE is generating alot of trafic on the

rather be reading mails which let me help others and be helped in my
actuall coding and Theory.

I have an E-IDE in the works (ROCK(c)) Directly related to E but Still I
keep my Discussions out of this list.  I have received and sent mails to
many who are on the list itself but I prefer not to broadcast them.

Is it possible for this thread to continue in the privacy of those

I think Ricardo Indirectly pointed into this idea by issuing an offical

the develpment of the project OR to be asked questions about where you
wish to go, but try to make them replies in private...

sorry IF I'm complaining about: "reading 8 mails per day not related to

I would have to disagree, I dont even code in E any more, but I still
like to track the list, and make the occasional post.  I find it
fascinating to see people really discuss where E is stron, and what
needs to be done to keep those features in a port.  I am sure that as
soon as it crystallises into an actual project they'll bugger off the
their own mailing list.

On the other hand, they could always do that now to make room on this
list, they can get a list for free at www.egroups.com.  Of course, I
woudlnt like that, but hey, if its bothering the other people on the
list, then by all means!

I can already see myself being bashed by all of you for going against the

Sorry, all of you, but don't be offended by my remark... I just find that
the list

What in particular are you interested in?  A lot of the stuff is private
to Wouter (e.g., the structure of the executable) for good reasons, so
you'll need to consult him if you want to do any "hacks".  The line debug
hunk (and the SYM hunk?) are pretty standard, though.

The linedebug hunk contains source code names and a table of which
hunk/offset

Execute() gives very little freedom. And SystemTagList() has SYS_INPUT and
SYS_OUPUT tags. Doesn't anyone read the includes anymore? (C ones,

Compile your prog with debug/linedebug and the sym option and have a
hex-typed look at it. Or even better, look at the executable using the
exe-datatype (util/dtype/exedt402.lha). It's somehow amazing what these
option write for information into your program.

I haven't read the DOS Manual but there is a AmigaGuide about the
hunk structure in dev/misc/HunkGuide.lha on AmiNet. If you write
something that read/write hunks (or maybe even a compiler :-)
could you please send me a copy of the source. I'm interested
in reading/writing executables, but I don't have enough time to
do somthing myself.

Hi All,

I'm not sure if a prior mail has found its way on the language E mailing

- ---ANOUNCING STEEL/ROCK Mailing list---
Yes, ROCK is getting its own mailing list.  The service is free, of
course, and any one can join.  it is unmoderated and can be viewed even
by Web interface :)

to subscribe, just send a blank mail to steel-subscribe@egroups.com

you will be asked to confirme and once this is done, your on the list!
I have noted that the eGroups system is VERY quick.

The list's intent is simple... exchange and dicuss the future and
potential of the ROCK and STEEL IDE.  You will be able to be heard by
the Development Team and help make this tool your own little gem.  Any
News will also be made public on the list first and in larger detail
than on the Web Site News.  All in All its a good place to be If your
interested in ROCK/STEEL  :)

Maybe I'm spoilt with MicroDot-II, but can't you sort the mail in your

That's why I say it should be configurable by the user (as it happens in
many mailing lists) and not imposed by the mailing list (as happens in
other cases). I don't mind having the option to receive mails with [E] on
subject as long as I can turn it off. You might need it to visually
separate messages from different MLs, but to those who use filters (like
me) it would be very annoying as we *already know* that every message in
this folder is from the E mailing list.

This may interest some of you, if they, as me, have abandoned the quite
ancient and buggy AMOS language to learn AmigaE.

If you go to http://members.xoom.com/AmosFactory/front.html you'll found
some news about the new development on AMOS and the fact that it can use
AmigaE modules (thanks to Wouter help). Moreover a new version of AMOS is
planned to be completely C++ written and portable, with PPC support and
optimization. This may be interesting to all those who are going to try to
create a new compiler for E and those who have still not deleted all their
Amos sources.

According to me the only things that made AMOS great were:

1) TOTALLY integrated environment. I'd like to code something like this...
2) Monitor on line

Well, it also has lots of custom functions that make handling graphics
quite easy and powerful. I know they are not OS friendly, are quite buggy
and slow. Nevertheles they are easy to use and to code in BASIC.

TCP programming in E is like in C, through bsdsocket.library (or
socket.library). I suggest you look for examples of this on AmiNet (dev/c/,

Yeah but Intuition's window functions aren't harder to use than E's  so
I never saw a point in using E's intuition routines...

But some of the gfx calls do save you a bit of data handling, but again,

Of course they are not hard to make. That is why they will not be any

I cannot 'subscribe', but I WILL support any new language features
directly within ROCK.  ROCK itself is passing beyond many of E's
Limitations by being a Code Generator and being able to parse stuff
independantly of the features of E.   Many constructs can be created
just by implementing low-level constructs (like multiple depth arrays
for example ;)

ROCK IDE is geting more 'mature' every week, so I guess they will be
able to grow together if we cooperate  :)

Date: Wed, 9 Dec 1998 13:51:43 +0100 (MET)
From: mfontana@komodo.ing.unico.it (mauro fontana)
Subject: Drag & Drop

I have what I belive is a small problem.

I need to do a drag&drop of a string which is taken from a custom made
listview. The listview is custom as I have not found a way to make a
standard one through the use of BOOPSI, but it is quite simple. It is a
read only listview where you can scroll trough a scroller placed in the
right border of the window.

Now I would like to have the chance to reorder the element displayed by
selecting them and then dragging them in a new position. I already have
created the routine that is able to take the right element selected (and
highlight it). However I don't really know how to attach the relative
displayed string to the cursor. Checking where the user has left the mouse
button to know where it want the element to be inserted should be quite
easy, similar to the select function.

Has anyone an idea on how to easily achieve the creation of a pointer with
a text string attached (which I presume should be converted in a graphic
element such as a sprite or a BOB).

I don't want to use any external libraries like MUI, tritor, BGUI or
wahtever. I was able to make my own auto adjusting windows depending on
user configuration files and now I just need a simple way to make visual
D&D.

Any ideas (or real solution)?

there is a drag&drop module at aminet, the example do exact the same, take
a string from a listview and put it to another listview.

Frankly, for such a small visual element, I'd just open a window and have it
follow in
real
time the cursor's position. make this a borderless string-sized window and
beleive me it
will drag in real time on ANY amiga in the world. To be sure the input
management remains
sane, only make a little condition where this temporary window ever looses
focus, it is
closed down... like if a user pops on another window, then the temporary
window simply
vanishes as if it has lost its use... you could even create a little hook
out of this
condition which deletes the previously 'dragged' node ;).  highly intuitive
and highly
simple to make.   PLUS
- -you need to learn NO new programming to achieve it.
- -its 100% intuition friendly  (you're simply using intuition calls)

Thanks for the advice. That is probably the easiest way to make the D&D
stuff. If is going to work smooth (as I suppose it will) then you'll be
credited in the program docs 8).

You have 3 possibilities:

- -Textfield.gadget.
Non-MUI, although MUI supports BOOPSI gadgets and you can actually
use it... Anyway, it sucks :P
I have some demo code and the module, since I used it till webPlug 1.25.

- -TextInput.mcc from Olliver Wagner
MUI class. Free, if this has not changed.
I have the modules and some demos in E, since I evaluated it to use
in webPlug 1.4... It didn't fit my needs, but it's a nice class.

- -Texteditor.mcc from Allan Oodgard
The coolest one of all. Fast, small, feature rich... But it's not free if
your
program isn't freeware.
I used it for webplug v1.4x

I have code for the 3... I'll send some sources to you if you want, but
you'll
have to wait till Monday...

BTW, I've coded my own textediting module for MUI for webPlug v2 :), but
for sure, one of the three I've mentioned will fit your needs...

Oh... The class is a shared library, but I cannot make a ".mcc" since MUI
opens
the library once per instance of the class. This results in random crashes
due
to EC's limitations in the library mode... A shame.

Anyone knows if this will change ?

I have an idea for a workaround:

Write a small library in something else (asm) that keeps a per process
opencount and opens the real, E coded, library only once for every process,
and then forwards calls (preferably directly through the jumptable).

This is systemfriendly (if you do it right) and only slows down open/close,
not usage.

<cough>  Well, I do :)

I'm very pleased to see that more than three people are
willing to produce a portable E compiler. I didn't work on
it for quite some time now, this is what it actually does
(,does' in this context means: it parses and produces code
for it.):

- - functions with local variables and parameters
- - stucture declarations and access
- - class declarations and attribute access
- - method definitions (like functions above) [*]
- - basic arithmetics (+-*/)
- - function calls

[*] I didn't pass the instance pointer to the methdo,
otherwise the generated code should be okay. :)

That's about it, with one or two additions. Compilation is
done in two steps:

1) scanning and parsing. The generated syntax tree will be
written to disk *as is*. No assumptions about the language
to be generated is made.

2) reading the syntax tree and generating the code. The code
generator will do any optimizations at this stage.

The compiler is written in E (there is an earlier version in
C). The scanner is based on Wouters scanner which he
published in some E version as example source. The parser is
implemented using EYacc which can be easily converted to
Yacc/Bison/JavaYacc (each item parsed will be passed as
parameter to a function).

The early C version of the compiler had a code generator
that produced code for a simple register machine. The current
code generator in the E version produces C code which
compiles fine with GCC 2.7.2.1.

The idea is to make the compiler compile itself, of course.

If somebody wants to see the source: just mail me. It's a
mess but it works. I started with it when I didn't know a
single thing about building compilers, maybe I'd code some
things different now. However, it sure would be as OO as it is
now.

To compile it one needs my oo hierarchy (parts of it). Maybe
I should just upload all the stuff to my university
account...

Is somebody reading this list who has actually built a compiler
already? Not for E, any language would do, somebody who
knows something about compilers should maybe take a look it
the sources :)

  grEgor

P.S. Somebody mumbled about too much compiler mails on this
list. I prefixed the subject with "[EC]" so anyone who
doesn't want to read these mails can skip, delete or forward
them to an extra folder. Maybe this helps :)

Date: Mon, 14 Dec 1998 13:04:27 +0100 (MET)
From: mfontana@komodo.ing.unico.it (mauro fontana)
Subject: SystemTagList and Execute

I am trying to execute a command line from inside another program. I have
had a look at the dos.library autodocs just to find that the functions to
use are Execute() or better SystemTagList(). However, I have not the DOS
RMKM, just the Exec and libraryies, but nothing is said about those
functions.

I have studied all interested part of the dos autodocs following almost
all the links, but I could get very few knowledge in it,

My problem is this. I have a program that can be run both from shell or
from WB and it behaves quite differently: it is just a normal cli command
with a normal template if run by CLI or it opens a window with gadgets and
all sorts of stuff if run from WB. The program just get some parameters,
from command line or string gadgets if the GUI is opened, and then it
saves a new file that can be executed with the execute command.

I have managed to make my program run the created script when run from
CLI, by using the quite simple Execute() function. As the script is saved
in a different directory and make access to relative paths, I just CD in
the right directory, then I call Execute() and in the end I restore the
current directory from where my program was called. Till here everything
is fine.

The problem is when I have to execute the script from the GUI. As there is
not a Input or Output devices associated with task launched in WB, I have
to create them. Moreover I have to cd to the right directory, and then
excecute the script. I thought the best way to do this was by using the
SystenTagList() functions and its tags. But I discovered I am not able to
do that, at least without the DOS RMK.
SystemTagList() requires a seglist that is returned by LoadSeg(). But
which is the command I have to LoadSeg()? I tried to LoadSeg() execute,
but a series of troubles appeared in Enforcer that reported an invalid
seglist was provided to SystemTagList(). I have to provide an output
device and an Input one. This one is also to give the parameters to the
executing command though the NP_PARAMETERS tag (if I can remember right),
but I am not able to open such devices. DO I have to use the InitClixxx()
functions? How? How I have to fill the DosPacket structure to pass to it?

Can anyone help me, please? I really would like to learn how to exploit
the dos.library a bit more.

RMKM?  Oh, "RKRM".  Yeah, documentation is a bit scarce.  You could try
looking at the E examples, though.  Try:

  Src/Rkrm/Workbench/appmenuitem.e - Even does Asynch

Or:

  Src/Utils/EDBG/edbg.e - Shows that you don't need an input or output

> SystemTagList() requires a seglist that is returned by LoadSeg().

I wouldn't have thought you'd need to go that far.  But, if you really do
want to do LoadSeg()ing stuff you'll want to use CreateNewProc() more
directly, probably.

I really DON'T know if I need that, but by calling SystemTagList() without
any NP_SEGLIST produces errors (as well as calling it with a SegList...).
I really cannot undestand how to use that function.

However, thanks a lot. I'l have a look at the example above to see if I
can get some more useful info.

SystemTagList() doesn't even support seglists.

SystemTagList( 'execute path:script' ,
              [
               SYS_INPUT  , script_stdin  ,
               SYS_OUTPUT , script_stdout ,

              ]
             )

Should work just fine.

Subject: Hello!!

Hello,

My name and nickname(handle) are on this letter.. :) and I and kinda new to
Amiga E and got on this list because I am going to need help, as a
beginner..
and I was hoping that I could find it here..

I've actually worked in old amiga e (V2.1) about 3 years ago or so.. and
made
a rather nice Cli based dice roller.. .. after that.. nothing much.. but
this
past year, I've been getting back into programming.. and I've been working
in
blitz Basic.. I like the tokenizing, and text highlighting and ease of use
of
blitz basic, since I tend to be a beginner.. it fit..

but due to the lack of support and updates in the package lately.. having to
deal with so many limitations in what comlimentary sofware packages there
are
for it.. I've been looking into Amiga E.. and found that it's come a REAL
long way since 2.1 .. debugger.. etc.. and I think I've learned enough in
blitzbasic to help me understand E better..

I've been working my ass off on an IRc client, that I may finish in
blitzbasic.. but my main problem is GUI.. Gadtools seems to be very limited
on what I can do in a listview, and I need to do colors.. so I need to do
MUI.. and MUIbuilder has a creator for E.. and none for Blitzbasic.. and I'm
lazy.. ;) ..

so, I'm looking into my options.. ..

comments?! help? suggestions??

Cheers!

Ok.
I have never used BlizBasic but as the same suggest it is a Basic 8). E is
a way lot more powerful than a Basic language. It can be described as a
cross between a (limited but simpler) C++ and Assembler implementation. It
has OOP, exception handling, very easy use of pointers, simple syntax,
support for inline Assembly, OS friendly interface (it uses all the
standard OS libraries with no problems).

However it cannot provide anything much that that OS cannot. Gadtools is
very limited (but surely it supports colors), maybe you should have a look
at BOOPSI. The ultra inflated use of MUI and such sort of bloated GUI just
for simple tools is not a good thing. Whatever MUI fans may say, MUI is
slow and uses tons of memeory even though more tasks share the same
libraries. Just have a look at web and Voyager to see which is faster and
"more" efficient when talking about resource handling. Using MUI just to
have 2 scaleable buttons in a window is not a very good thing, as people
tend too look at their resource when using a program, and if another
program can do the same things, but it smaller, faster and uses less
memory (evn though it can resize its window) I think they probably will go
and use this one.

Enough said about MUI.

However, E comes with a quite good "framework" for GUIs, by using a
relative small modoule (~40K) that is able to create scaleable GUIs with
many different gadgets (and new ones can be easily created if you need
them). It may be worth a look.

Have fun.

Yeah, EasyGui is really nice. The definition of a GUI in such a way, how=20
you have to do it with EasyGui is much more powerfull than the stupid
"paint your GUI" way (like in Delphi, if anybody know what I mean :-)

Don't blame MUI for the lame speed of Web-Browsers. Every text, link,
picture, table, tableentry, ... is an own MUI-object. This is an
very strict OO-sceme but slow like hell (as MUI was never designed to
do that, even if you *can* do it). Using the class-feature of MUI
in an normal way (making an own class for every window-type)
helps a lot to encapsulate the related actions. Otherwise you get
tons of (action-)functions floating around in your sources.
Using MUI is an *very clean* to program an GUI and it's
interactions.

The low startup of V is caused by it's (non-optimal IMO) way of handling the
cache. IBrowse starts as fast as AWeb in my system...
And V parses the HTML files faster than AWeb, too... Although AWeb
supports more tags and I suppose that this may cause a little
slowdown in the rendering of the page.

I don't blame MUI for how it works internally, but for what it takes
externally (time, space, memory). Your considerations are not much
different to saying that using Microsoft developer tools is a good thing
because they make programmer life easier and the compiled program result
in a neat code, even though it is big and run slow (when it works 8) ).
I would say that, if there were not other alternatives, only MUI could be
used to create Browser. But AWeb just demonstrates that a browser can be
done better and faster without the use of MUI.

A would dare that a small offline browser that supports HTML 3.2 and can
do table layout quite well, with PNG and JPG support, leaving all other
(unuseful) features off, would be the natural successor of AmigaGuide.
However having to use about 1.5MB of memory and waiting for 10 seconds for
loading a HTML viewer, as thy are now, it's a thing more Windowze prone
than an Amiga one.

Well, that's my thought, anyway. Anyone is free to waste his resources
(and money) as he wants.

Try disabling the progressive layout display in AWeb (V does not support
that). And however AWeb is much faster when reloading a page as it can
mantain picture in its cache and does not decompress them every time.
Moreover I see that AWeb layout is much better than V and IBrowse ones
(expecially for tables).

Hehe... Ok... Won't start a war of browsers combined with MUI/ClassAct
now :)

BTW, progressive display on AWeb is only for tables, something I
personally (***personally***) don't like since tables have to be rendered
once the browser knows all the details of the table.

Progressive display of tables :) All the browsers support progressive
display. Additionally, AWeb offers to display tables progressively too.
This is what (again, IMO) doesn't make sense... In most cases, the
browser will have to render the table twice or more because of colspans,
rowspans and so...

to accent your point.. I have the following to say..

My IRC client is about 20% to 50% faster on connect ALONE using GADTOOLS and
BLITZ...  and my input text routine is nothing short of wordy.. I tend to
make all my programs (or I at least TRY to) intelligent.. so in knows what's
coming in.. and the only way to make a program smart is to have a lot of
data
sorting code.. and a lot of exceptions..  although IRc text is generally
simple it still analyzes the data very closely.. makes it easier for future
implemenations..

I have generally done my best to avoid MUI.. I never really wanted to go to
it.. but if I want to do colors in IRC.. I have to.. Gadtools doesn't
support
colors in a listview, simple as that.. I view MUI as I do windows, to be
honest.. it may be the new stadard.. but is it HOMESTLY the best thing??
more
than once I have had my system crashed by MUI.. not the programs running
under it..

You can aways use BOOPSI and create easily a listview that supports
colors, different stylers and even different fonts by the use if
intuition text. I have done this myself with good results, so that should
not be a problem for more skilled programmers (that should be many). You
probably should be able to do the same things directly with gadtools
gadgets, even though this may be a bit more tricky.

This is due to poor web-page design, to stop this occuring define all
the image widths, and define table widths, the web-browser can then
progressively load the table as the table has strict size limits. As
long as the user is using a display =640 in width, this is not a
problem. (Although you may find that you`ll want to <CENTER> everything
for the benefit of >640 width.)

Even good page design can be "problemtic", for example, using "td width=x"
in a row which is not the first...

Anyway, since this (table progressive display) is configurable, everyone can
do whatever he/she prefers :)

Why not GetRGB32()?

Oh well, GetRGB4() works like this:

MODULE 'intuition/screens' ,
       'graphics/view'

PROC main()

 DEF screen : PTR TO screen

 IF ( screen := LockPubScreen( NIL ))

   WriteF( '$\h\n' , GetRGB4( screen.viewport.colormap , Val( arg )))
   UnlockPubScreen( NIL , screen )

 ENDIF

ENDPROC

Prints the hex-value of colour #<arg> on default pubscreen.

and RGB..

red   := Shr( rgb AND $F00 , 16 )
green := Shr( rgb AND $0F0 , 8 )
blue  := rgb AND $00F

(rgb is the return from GetRGB4())

Sure.
In my GetRGB4() example I made a mistake when dividing it in RGB components
(didn't actually test my code). The Shr() sized should be 8 and 4, not 16
and
8.

GetRGB32( colmap , first , of , table )

first is the first colour number you want, of is the number of colours you
want, and table is PTR TO LONG (at least of*3 LONGs) where it will store the
values. So to get just one:

DEF table[ 3 ] : ARRAY OF LONG

GetRGB32( screen.viewport.colmap , Val(arg) , 1 , table )

The rest of that code can be taken from my other example.. here of course
red   := table[ 0 ]
green := table[ 1 ]
blue  := table[ 2 ]
and not as in that one..

based on the info provided by Carl I have put this together to return the
RGB of a specific colour of workbench. However this still is not returning
correct values. Please can someone look at the attactment and work out
the problem 'cause I thought getting the RGB of a colour would be dead
simple. I am also experiencing similar problems with GetRGB4() only
returning a maximum value of 15 per R, G OR B instead of a full 255.
For example my WB colour 2 is white and should return 255, 255, 255
but instead GetRGB4 returns 15, 15, 15. For the same example the
attactprogram returns -1, -1, -1.

GetRGB4() is named as it iss because it is 4 bit. 4 bits = 0 - 15. It
returns
the numbers it is supposed to.

Your attached program also returns the correct values, at least for me. Try
printing them in hex instead and it will be much easier to see.

GetRGB32() ofcourse is 32 bit, and therefore returns 0 - 2^32-1, wich means
that \d, wich prints signed numbers, will print -1 for the largest,
something
very large negative for middle, and still zero for zero.
Shr( table[ x ] , 24 ) will give you the desired 0-255 number.

Hello

I am new to amiga programming and am trying some things with gadgets.  I
can get them to work fine except for two instances.

Two cases cause enforcer hits, but seem to work fine.  In these cases I
am using a slider and am trying to use a function to display snippets of
text from a string instead of just the numbers.

The hits occur when I am defining these gadgets, not when I use them.

If anyone can suggest what I meight be doing wrong here I would appreciate
it.

Here is the offending code...

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
DEF my_gads[46]:ARRAY OF LONG /*This is large enough*/

/*This declaration causes hits...*/

ng.topedge    := ng.topedge+15
ng.height     := 12
ng.width      := 100
ng.gadgettext := 'Sprite:'
ng.gadgetid   := SPR_SLIDER
my_gads[SPR_SLIDER]:=(gad:=CreateGadgetA(SLIDER_KIND, gad, ng,
                                 [GTSL_MIN,         0,
                                  GTSL_MAX,         8,
                                  GTSL_LEVEL,       mCur.sprt,
                                  GTSL_LEVELFORMAT, '\s',
                                  GTSL_LEVELPLACE, PLACETEXT_RIGHT,
                                  GTSL_MAXLEVELLEN, 11,
                                  GTSL_DISPFUNC,    {num2sprt},
                                  GT_UNDERSCORE,    "_",
                                  NIL]))
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

This slider declaration causes no hits... the only difference is that this
one doesn't use GTSL_DISPFUNC... so I must be doing something wrong when
I use it, but what???

ng.topedge    := 31
ng.leftedge   := 528
ng.height     := 12
ng.width      := 57
ng.gadgettext := 'Amount: '
ng.gadgetid   := FEAR_SLIDER
my_gads[FEAR_SLIDER]:=(gad:=CreateGadgetA(SLIDER_KIND, gad, ng,
                                 [GTSL_MIN,         0,
                                  GTSL_MAX,         5,
                                  GTSL_LEVEL,       mCur.fear,
                                  GTSL_LEVELFORMAT, '\d[2]/5',
                                  GTSL_LEVELPLACE, PLACETEXT_RIGHT,
                                  GTSL_MAXLEVELLEN, 3,
                                  GT_UNDERSCORE,    "_",
                                  NIL]))

- --------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the function called by the slider, just in case that might be the
problem. (although I don't think so because the enforcer hit is caused
during declaration of the slider, not use of it.)

PROC num2sprt(level,gad:PTR TO gadget) RETURN sprtArray+(level*7)

Thanks for the help!

I have not looked at your gadtools stuff cause I have not used in ages, but
I
can tell you that your function is not very 'elegent' IT may be the reason
since it is essentially an emtpy function...altough it is not neccesserily
bad, enforcer IS strict.

try this and tell me if it clears your problems:

PROC num2sprt(level,gad:PTR TO gadget) IS sprtArray+(level*7)

theroetically this is the proper way of creating a one-line function. :)

Hi.

We need to know how ng has been defined, have you defined it as a PTR
TO newgadget? If you have, there is your problem. Need to know all of
your defines for this code, you may be using a ptr as if it were a
variable, (common enforcer problem) Otherwise the code looks fine.

Also are you using mungwall? you may find munging your memory will
cause this program to crash spectacularly, also, use EDBG to trace down
the exact location of the enforcer hit by mannually stepping through
the code.

Thanks.

*Shudder* =)
People now a days =) don't seem to understand pointers.
Pointers are just that. The pointer to data. They do *not* contain or have
any
space for the data. That space must be separatly and explicitly allocated.
Either NEW or New*() or Alloc*() or allocating it directly on the stack by
defining it just as :newgdget, not PTR TO.

  Try '%s' instead of '\s'.  You need to use C-style formatting cmds instead
of E's with this tag.

EC converts '\s' to '%s'. For example, VfPrintf(out,'text: \s\n',[str])
works.

Well, if we are to keep it simple this is how the simplest executable file
looks: (Must be position independant)
All numbers are LONGs:
$3f3 $0 $1 $0 $0
LONGs of code. That's codesize/4, rounded up.
$3e9
LONGs of code, again.
Now you write the actual code, pad so it really is dividable by 4.
$3f2
EOF

That's about as much as you need to know if you just want to write a
*really*
simple exefile.

LONG temp = $12080000

You should also know that a LONG is 4 bytes, not 8.

FWrite() takes pointers, you give it a value. {variable} gives the pointer.

foo := $12080000
Fwrite( outfile , {foo} , 4 , 1 )
should work. Note 4 and not 8, LONGs are only 4 bytes.
You could write "SIZEOF LONG" and you wouldn't have to know that. =)

I'm in a big trouble because I cannot understand a thing on how to code
floats
in E. I've checked both the "Beginner's Guide" and the "Reference Guide" but
I'm not able to enter in the logic !

Here's attached a little example: the aim is to create a synthetizing
program.
I've deleted every *!* from the source in order not to make mess, hoping
that
you'll help me ! What have I to do ?

Kind regards

E.guide describes where you have to put exclamation marks, with examples.

Subject: Deleting layers on a screen - Content cleared :/

   Hello all,

Whenever I delete a layer I have created and have drawn in, from,
say, the Workbench screen, the piece of bitmap the layer was
covering is cleared. Does anyone know the proper way of
making sure the bitmap under the deleted layer recieves it's
original contents again?

This is how I am creating the layer. Is the bitmap I am using
the correct bitmap to use to create a layer on a screen?

mylayer := CreateUpfrontLayer(li, myscr.bitmap, layx, layy, layx1, layy1,
LAYERSIMPLE, NIL)

Also, would it be more efficient to create a layer for something
like my progress window module rather than creating a borderless
window?

Thanks in advance. :)
Bye.

This is not a bug, it is a feature. If you delete the layer then all
things drawn on this layer will be removed.

You can leave the layer on the screeen or draw to a shadow bitmap with
layer and than copy the contents of the layer-bitmap to the screen.

To create on the screen IMHO correct, but I am not sure if it allowed to
use directly myscr.bitmap, better myscr.rport.bitmap for compatibility?

I thought of doing this, but thought maybe there was a nicer way of
doing it than having to store a copy of a piece of bitmap.
Is this how Intuition restores the bitmap after a window has
been closed?

>To create on the screen IMHO correct, but I am not sure if it allowed to

The autodocs say screen.bitmap is just an extra copy of
screen.rastport.bitmap, so there should be no problems?

For one of my modules, I have a borderless window that opens. A progress
bar is drawn in the window, and a program can then set the percentage
of the bar that is filled for whatever task it is doing.
I thought maybe it would take up less memory, etc, if I used a layer to
draw the progress bar on, rather than a borderless window?

Thanks. Bye :)

Just wanted to but in and say that in the RKRMs 'libraries' book they talk
about using layers.library under intuition and it is expressly stated that
one
should NOT assume any window or Screen structure to be safe with
layers.library functions...  the system is using them and dangerous race
conditions and other nasties can occur if you are not carefull...

generally, if you are going to intuition, do not go beyond graphics.library
and rastports.  you CAN use bitmaps directly though.  I would recommend you
use a non-smart-refresj window if you do not want to use too much memory, as
it does not allocate any bitmap memory when opening... it only stores the
window struct data itself (But you must refresh everytime a window is
moved/sized layer over-off of your window!).

I think, only the various layer to front and similar functions are
considered
safe.

I have implemented many pop-up gadgets for easygui and I find the fastest
and
easiest solution is always to open such a borderless window (or even a
requester if you are familiar with them...) and draw using any
graphics.library routines directly on that.  its the only system-legal way
of
doing it.  (plus, using windows (under Amiga) is not memory intensive).
anyways...)

A layer is just like a template or foil laying over your bitmap. If you
remove this template or foil the contents will be removed to.

Yes, but IMHO there is something written on the Developer CD to use the
rastport and not the screen infonrmation. But I am not sure.

I think there is no real advantage to use a layer rather than a window. A
borderless window is a layer and not so much more. You can use
SIMPLEREFRESH and IDCMP_Flags=3D0L to save memory etc.

I would use the window because the window is a higher intuition function
then a layer and if something will be changed (sometimes) in the OS than
the lower functions.=20

So I need help with:

1. Maybe someone has some AT/XT keyboard driver already written?

2. How to lock printer port in easest way? (I want to be system friendly :)

3. How to disable interupts in Amiga for a while? I wrote some test driver
and
I receive random errors. I debugged all the asembler source- no errors!
Maybe
some interupts steals my CPU time? Or maybe some cache problems? Help.

If you are using the parralel port, just learn the protocol of the keyboard
you
are using and that should suffice to make it talk to you computer via
parallel.device...

don't PC keyboards use serial ports... even the oldies

why don't you just use parralel.device... much easier & system friendly...
plus
it will work on any amiga model even if it has non-amiga parallel ports!

It is not real serial, it is keyboard... :) two lines: KBD data and KBD

BTW all old Amiga uses same hardware configurations. If you use some special
Printer add-on (like special LPT card), I am not sure, you can program every
pin separatelly.

   The actuall problem is in synchronization... I have programmed robotics
on my
Amiga in the past (by using PowerTransistors and Stepper motors) and the
real pain
(in serial comms) is to get the external electronics to receive/send the
signals
in the right time...

   BUT this does not exist with normal parallel operation, there is a pin
which is
used to send a little signal to/From the computer that your device is now
READING
or WRITING to the computer... when the state CHANGES, both systems can
react...
the way I see the signal being sent (by your analysis at the top) I'd say
you
should plug the CLK pin to this R/W selector and you should ask the system
to read
the value at the port.  Then zero-in on the byte you want to read and glue
the
consecutive bytes up to the binary word lenght of the serial signal you are
transmitting...

Like a transcoder in fact...

If you are electronicly aware, you can EASILY build such a transcoder using
VERY
basic Flip-Flops... then every 7-8 bits (which I guess is your word length)
activate the R/W pin on the computer  :)

You can use parallel.device to work with above algorythm...  I'm not saying
I've
tried it... just that it is one potential solution...  ;)

When I say R/W I also mean that you must use the pulse, which tells system
that
there is 'new' data at the port (or more precisely within the BUS)... look
into
any digital Electronic book under RS-232 parallel port and it will describe
it in
detail... its quite easy , really.

I am just playing with this barcode reader :) I don't know what I could do

I managed to write some software to read all data from this device, but this

Well, I'm not very sure if this will help, but if you want TOTAL or almost
total processoryou can use this:

Forbid() -> Stop all processor activity except your program
... your code here...
Permit() Let the system use the processor again

Disable()
=2E..
Enable()

Disable() disables task switching and interrupts; Forbid() only disables
task switching.

Be careful that Wait() enables everything until the signal is received and
that there is absolutely no way out if you get an infinite loop inside.

Subject: OT: Multiview

Hello world,

I'm getting in trouble when reading the "Beginner's Guide" with Multiview.
As
you know the document is composed by a central guide (let's call it INDEX)
which calls some other *.guide* files externally.
When I start the central doc, everything is good, but when I try to access
the
others ,Multiview tells me
it's loading but nothing appears .
What have I done wrong ?

Kind regards

the index and external guides MUST be in the same directory...

Did you specify a full path (this is a Multiview bug!)?

Actually, all files must be in currentdir.
mv som_dir/some.guide
never worked for me. (except on the "first page").

@node ID35_0 "MUI listviews (ID35_0)"
From: torchia@windsor.igs.net (Ralph Torchia)
Date: Mon, 28 Dec 1998 22:40:21 -0500
Subject: MUI listviews

Hello Everyone,

I've just recently joined the list (just found out about it), so I
appologize if the following problem I've had has already been discussed,
but I've beeen going crazy for 2 days trying to figure it out. (also excuse
me if I do not use the proper vocabulary for certain programming items; I
have been teaching myself how to program my Amiga with some books and
texts -- I am somewhat of a beginner at this, esp. with AmigaE)

Here is the situation.  I'm working on a MUI program with contains 2
listviews.  These listviews are to have items added, changed and deleted to
their lists.  I'm also using NodeMaster to keep a copy of the list.

I've created some procedures:  addToList(), removeFromList() and
changeItem().  Example of one:

   PROC changeItem(gadget, nodelist:PTR TO nodemaster, text, pos)
      nodelist.item(pos)
      nodelist.change(text)
      doMethodA(gadget,[MUIM_List_Remove,pos])
      doMethodA(gadget,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,text,pos])
   ENDPROC

where:
  gadget - mui gadget
  text - text to add to list
  pos - position in list to add new text

This procedure is being called from another procedure that does something
like this:

   DEF command[256]:STRING

   StringF(command,'Install Files = \d',maxfiles)
   changeItem(gadget_synclist,synclist,command)

This code works fine for nodemaster, but the item that is inserted into the
MUI list is seen as random/garbage letters (as if accessing an area of
random memory?)

I tried using hooks for the lists in MUI, but this made no difference.
I also tried to replace the text with {text}, and also attempted to use
the newly changed node in nodemaster (with obj() ).

So what am I doing wrong?

Sincerely,

Hello Ralph

I think I found out what's wrong....

It seems like MUI-listviews does not like E-strings.
Every time I try to use an E-string in a
listview, I get strange results. Initialy everything looks fine,
but when you resize the window or use the scroller on the side,
strange things start happening.

Like this...

DEF mystr[10]:STRING
StrCopy(mystr,'Hello')
doMethodA(mygad,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,mystr,MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom])

...but...

DEF x
X:='Hello'
doMethodA(mygad,[MUIM_List_InsertSingle,x,MUIV_List_Insert_Bottom])

...works fine.

Does anybody know more about this...?

If I'm not mistaken, 'text' points to an E-string and _not_ 'PTR TO CHAR'

There shouldn't be any difference..

An E-string *is* a PTR TO CHAR. It has some addisional info at negative
offsets, but it can allways be used where a simple array of CHARs is
required.

Hi there,

             if you want to program in E i suggest you get the amigee
archive from aminet (dev/e/amigae33.lha) which contains everything
you need to get started including a beginners guide and a more general
guide on how to program in e.
