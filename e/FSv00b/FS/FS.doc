                            MAILWARE

                  Sorry for my poor english...

    Introduction:
    =============
  You can use this program just on your own!!!
  I wrote first Not Public version(0.0a) when my Amiga had broke keyboard.
  So I wrote it in GoldEd with "Inserd ASCII..." by Mouse. When I got
  another CIA8520 (with broken Parallel port), I rewrote it and I use it
  very often...
  If you will find a bug?!? so send me a Mail or a Letter...

  Source code included.

  If you want to use it for comercial use, so send me a mail or a letter...

    Usage:
    ======
  FS (That`s all)


    Requirements:
    =============
  FS has been written in AmigaE3.2e !!!...
  Because there is macro so it requeres AmigaE3.1a, I think.
  I think, It can run on all Amigas with OS1.2 and higher?!?

  FS requires in your "S:" file "FS.data", this file has 20 lines:
    First 10 lines are button names(which you will see on the screen)
    Secont 10 lines are names of files to be executed:

  e.g.:
>   SuperDuper
>   DCopy
>   ReOrg
>   Nexus7
>   DirWork1.62
>
>
>   Imagine v2.0
>
>   Reset
>   HD0:Programs/Disk/SD
>   C:DCopy
>   HD0:Programs/Disk/ReOrg
>   HD1:Games/Demos/Nexus7
>   HD0:Programs/File/DW
>
>
>   HD1:Ray/Imagine/Imagine
>
>   C:ReBoot

        OK, So do you understand it?, Yes?, Very Well...


    Installing:
    ===========
  For install use the Installation Icon -> You will have to confirm all
  operations, so why are you afraid.


    Executing:
    ==========
  Add in to your "S:StartUp-Sequence" after SetPatch-line folowing lines:

>   GetLMB          ; This command is included
>   If WARN
>     C:FS
>     Quit 5
>   ENDIF

  Now You can ReBoot your GreatSuperMegaUltraPerfectComputer Amiga and
  for few seconds press Left Mouse Button. If it is installed correctly
  so you will see very nice screen(320x256x4colours) with ten buttons.
  When screen is opened so you can stop your pressing the mouse and try
  to select a button. If you will press Right Mouse Button, so you will
  leave FS.


    MAILWARE:
    =========
  If you like this soft, so it`s decent to send me a Mail...
