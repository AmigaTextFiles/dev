   NAME
       pl61_Inquire -- get a pointer to the replayer's status block.

   SYNOPSIS
       statusblock = pl61_Inquire( )
       D0

       struct p61status * pl61_Inquire( void );

   FUNCTION
       Get a pointer to the replayer's status block. This block is mostly
       read-only; you CAN write to the volume, tempo and play fields, and
       the replayer will react to your changes. The other fields should
       generally only be read from.

   RESULT
       statusblock - pointer to the replayer's internal status block.

   NAME
       pl61_Play -- Play a p61 module.

   SYNOPSIS
       error = pl61_Play( module,sampledata,samplebuffer )
       D0                A0     D1         D0

       LONG pl61_Play( APTR,APTR,APTR );

   FUNCTION
       Initialize the replayer and start playing the given module.
       Unpack samples into the given samplebuffer if necessary.

   INPUTS
       module       - pointer to a P61 module.
       sampledata   - pointer to the module's samples, or NULL if the
                      samples follow the module.
       samplebuffer - pointer to a buffer into which the sample data should
                      be unpacked into, or NULL if the samples are not
                      packed. Make sure the buffer is large enough to hold
                      the unpacked data!

   RESULT
       error - if the replayer started successfully, this will be NULL.
               If for whatever reason the replayer failed to start, this
               will be non-NULL.

   NOTES
       Make sure the final sample buffer is in CHIP RAM! If the samples
       follow the module, the module buffer should be in CHIP RAM; if the
       samples come in their own buffer, that buffer should be in CHIP RAM;
       if they are packed, the buffer to unpack into should be in CHIP RAM.

player61.library/pl61_SetPos                        player61.library/pl61_SetPos

   NAME
       pl61_SetPos -- jump to the given module position.

   SYNOPSIS
       pl61_SetPos( position )
                   D0

       void pl61_SetPos( WORD );

   FUNCTION
       Jumps to the specified position in the module, if the replayer is
       running.

   NOTES
       Don't call this if pl61_Play() didn't succeed, or if you never called
       pl61_Play()!

   SEE ALSO
       pl61_Play()

player61.library/pl61_SetVol                        player61.library/pl61_SetVol

   NAME
       pl61_SetVol -- set the master volume.

   SYNOPSIS
       pl61_SetVol( volume )
                   D0

       void pl61_SetVol( WORD );

   FUNCTION
       Set the master volume (the volume field in the p61status structure)
       to the given value. This is safe to call whether or not the replayer
       is actually running.

       pl61_Inquire()

player61.library/pl61_Stop                            player61.library/pl61_Stop

   NAME
       pl61_Stop -- stop the replayer.

   SYNOPSIS
       pl61_Stop( )

       void pl61_Stop( void );

   FUNCTION
       If the replayer was started successfully with pl61_Play(), this
       function turns the replayer off and deallocates all resources.

   NOTES
       Don't call this if pl61_Play() didn't succeed, or if you never called
       pl61_Play()!
