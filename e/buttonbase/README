Short:    EasyGUI PLUGINs: New BOOPSI buttons
Type:     dev/e
Author:   Victor Ducedre (victord@netrover.com)
Date:     5-Jun-98
Requires: OS v37+

    This plugin creates a GadTools Listview gadget, almost identical to the
standard EasyGUI one, with an extra flag that's set when a list item is
double-clicked.  

    This is the first release.  Of course, there may be bugs, (for example,
this code hasn't been tested under 2.x) and feedback is appreciated.
