        This is a button gadget similar to, and somewhat compatible with,
    that used in 'button.gadget' from the EasyGUI distribution, only enhanced
    in a few ways that I felt were necessary:

        - Gadtools-style underlining for keyboard shortcuts;
        - alternate frame types;
        - alternate image for selected gadgets (no more needing to change it
          yourself:^);
        - not apt to get mixed up with ClassAct's identically-named
          'button.gadget';

        This is a work in progress (hence the omission of the source code from
    this archive; this will change once I'm happy with the workings of the
    gadget), but I feel it is far enough along that I can release it, along
    with suitable EasyGUI plugins to drive it.

        There is as yet no included documentation for the gadget to allow its
    use outside of EasyGUI;  studying the Plugin sources should glean enough
    info about how to use the gadget.  But be forewarned:  the specifications
    for this gadget are subject to change, and very likely will.

        Also be forewarned:  This gadget works just fine for me, and the
    limited testing I've done on it, but I make no guarantees, yada yada yada,
    don't blame me.
