<li><big>Description:</big><br>
  WITH keyword introduces the namespaces support. If You have a part of code, where
  You use very often some deep variable pointers (eg.: a.b.c.d), You would probably
  like to be able to leave it. You can make it simply by preprocessor, but it's not
  very clear solution. Better, and for this purpose made solution is the namespaces
  support, where You define a variable, which You don't wish to enter in the source
  and then use only items, that are contained in the variable's object.<br><br>

  But to use it correctly, be sure, that item/variable names won't collide! Else if
  there is a variable and an item with same names, the variable is taken! If You
  define one WITH inside another WITH, the inside one has higher priority and will
  be taken before the 'parent' one. If You define multiple variables (WITH a,b,c)
  the first one is taken first.<br><br>

  You can use simple (a) and complex (a.b[x].c) variables.<br><br>

<li><big>Syntax:</big>

<font color=#ff0000><pre>
  WITH &lt;variable1,variable2,...&gt;
    code, where the variable should be automaticaly inserted.
  ENDWITH
</pre></font><br><br>

<li><big>Example:</big>
  
<font color=#ff0000><pre>
  OBJECT obj
    name,age,sex

  PROC main()
    DEF person:PTR TO obj

    WITH person
      name:='MarK'
      age:=24
      sex:="M"
    ENDWITH

  ENDPROC
</pre></font><br>
  this does exactly the same as:
<font color=#ff0000><pre>
  OBJECT obj
    name,age,sex

  PROC main()
    DEF person:PTR TO obj

    person.name:='MarK'
    person.age:=24
    person.sex:="M"

  ENDPROC
</pre></font>
