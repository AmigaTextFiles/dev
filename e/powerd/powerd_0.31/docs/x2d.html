<br><big><center>x2d v1.0<br>by Martin Kuchinka</center></big><br>
<ul type=square>
<li><big>What it is:</big><br>
  It's an ultimate conversion utility, that should convert all the known file
  formats like the c-headers, e-modules, fd-files and much more, but currently
  it can convert only the fd files. You can see, that it's not very ultimate
  yet ;), but the FD conversion is very important, it's not just another
  <a href="fd2m.html">fd2m</a> utility, this also generates the ppc link-lib
  files to be able to use 68k libraries within ppc code, it's currently
  required to generate these files.
<br><br>

<li><big>Limitations:</big><br>
  It's limited more then You can even imagine ;)
<br><br>

<li><big>How to use it:</big><br>
  It has just one argument, the source file, what can currently be only some
  FD file. Nevertheless if You don't define this argument, a requester will
  open.
