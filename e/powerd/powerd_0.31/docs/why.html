<p>It is simple, I wanted to use fpu, but AmigaE didn't work with it directly, so I used
  bettermath modules (by Michal Bartczak) and later I did my own fpu modules, but it was
  quite frustrating when I wanted add a to b to use a function. All that time I got an
  idea to create my owm programming language, because I was sure that AmigaE will never
  use fpu and newer processors.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the 1998 I started to play with equation reading, simple compilers,
  etc. In the middle of 1998 I started working on PowerD.<br><br>

  In march 99 Wouter van Oortmerssen (author of AmigaE) stopped developing of AmigaE. At
  this time I was sure to continue my developing. (Many times I wanted to stop it because
  of unsolvable problems, but at last I solved them all :^))</p>

<p>When I got Amiga (1993), I got some 3d raytracing programs and I was lost...  I
  wanted to create my own 3d raytracing program that will be better then all other, but in
  which programming language should I do it? I could work only with AMOS basic, and it is
  not good to do 3d raytracing program in basic. I started to learn assembler (1994), it
  is also not good programming language to create so big project (it could have many MB
  of assembler source). Then I tried Pascal and C. One is worse then the second. Later (in
  1995) I tried AmigaE. Wow, really fast and short programs! I started to work on my own
  3d raytracing program. I registered it in 1996. Everything looked good, but I bought
  Blizzard 1230/50 with 16MB of RAM and FPU. AmigaE wasn't enough at this time. I tried C,
  but returning max one value per function is incredibly few (AmigaE can return 3 values).
  So I did something in AmigaE and something in C.</p>

  This was the time to create a language what will be good for everything!
