  Some parts of this document are currently not done, just wait. Something
  written in this document does not work, please email me about it, PowerD
  is quite large (25000 lines=800 kb of source code written in AmigaE)
  and I'm only man, I can't know everything, if You will tell me about that
  error, I will eliminate it as soon as possible.<br><br>

  As I said, this is quite large project, it takes very much time
  (especially finding errors). So, if You want to help me by writing
  support programs, please email me. In near future I want to add gui
  something like StormC has. Maybe VisualD. Everyone who can/want/will
  help me is welcome.<br><br>

  If you have some ideas/bug-reports/suggestions/etc. please <a href="author.html">email</a> me.
