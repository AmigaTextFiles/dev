  NOFPU OPTion allows You to compile code that will use floats/doubles also
  on machine which has not any FPU. This is currently very limited and buggy.
  Output code is very bad, because PowerD still generates FPU code, but it
  is internaly converted to non FPU code. Each instruction is converted to
  set of non fpu instructions with some math library calls when needed.
<br><br>

  Currently works with this option only following functions and operators:
<br><br>

  Sin(), Cos(), Tan(), ASin(), ACos(), ATan(), Sinh(), Cosh(), Tanh(),
  Sqrt(), Pow(), FAbs(), Ln(), Log()
<br>
  other functions are fpu only!!!
<br><br>
  +,-,*,/  (no \ (modulo))
