  Blizzard...<br><br>

    memory and about 24000 allocations, now about 350 kB and 14000 allocations, compiling
    time was about 90 seconds on unexpanded A1200, now takes about 35 seconds)
  <li>added <a href="cli.html">INFO/S</a> switch in cli.
  </ul><br><br>

    Development is currently quite slow because my blizzard ppc is broken down, and I have
  to develop powerd on unexpanded A1200 with hd :(<br><br>

  <li>added some functions (Val(), RealVal(), RealStr(), etc.) to PowerD.lib
  <li>removed many more or less important bugs
  </ul><br><br>

  Following versions I uploaded to aminet, but there were problems with main german site,
  and I'm not sure if someone got it. I think, it's no so important, because in this time
  I eliminated (very) many bugs.<br><br>

  <ul type=disc>
  <li>now works with linked functions what has not arguments
  <li>improved returning values

    procedures named like: &Ouml;&Uuml;&Auml;, testov&aacute;n&iacute;, etc. See <a href="ascii.html">0-255</a>, this is good
    for non-english programmers.

  <li>removed some enforcer hits and small bugs
  </ul><br><br>
