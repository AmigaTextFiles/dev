<li><big>Description:</big><br>

    Linked libraries are on amiga used in many programming languages
  except AmigaE, so I added linked library support into PowerD. Linked
  libraries can contain many more or less useful functions. The defference
  between linked libraries and normal libraries is that linked library
  will add its functions into the your code, so the executables will be
  quite longer instead of normal libraries's (usually in libs:) functions
  will be only called, those functions needs only to open the library. On
  other platforms than Amiga are linked libraries more often (somewhere only
  possible :^().<br><br>

<li><big>Calling functions from linked libraries:</big><br>

  Calling is absolutely the same as calling procedures, only the definition
  is slightly defferent.<br><br>
