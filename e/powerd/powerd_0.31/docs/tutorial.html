<li><big>Description:</big><br>
  PowerD is a procedural programming language like C, Pascal or AmigaE are.
<br><br>

<li><big>Format:</big><br>
  This doesn't have any effect for the compiler, but it is very important
  all beginners, because it highly enhances source code reading and
  orientation in it. You need only one thing to choose for Your sources
  to be most readable for You. It's size of the tabulator. Watch these
  two sources, the first doesn't have any formatting, but the second does:
<font colour=#ff0000><pre>
  PROC main()
  DEF i
  FOR i:=0 TO 10
  SELECT i
  CASE 0 TO 2
  PrintF('Beginning\n')
  CASE 3 TO 8
  PrintF('Working\n')
  CASE 9 TO 10
  PrintF('Finishing\n')
  ENDSELECT
  ENDFOR
  PrintF('made loops: \d\n',i)
  ENDPROC
</pre></font><br>
  and
<font colour=#ff0000><pre>
  PROC main()
     DEF i
     FOR i:=0 TO 10
        SELECT i
        CASE 0 TO 2
           PrintF('Beginning\n')
        CASE 3 TO 8
           PrintF('Working\n')
        CASE 9 TO 10
           PrintF('Finishing\n')
        ENDSELECT
     ENDFOR
     PrintF('made loops: \d\n',i)
  ENDPROC
</pre></font><br>
  I suppose You will agree with me, that the second is much more readable.
  I preffer to use as tabulators normal tabulators (ascii 9) of size three
  like above, but select what You like, You can use spaces instead of
  tabulators, but then the source code grows without any effect. It is also
  better for error making, it will be for You much more difficult to forget
  eg. the ENDFOR keyword if You will use any formatting, right? :)
<br><br>

<li><big>Variables:</big><br>
  Variables must be defined, like in other non-basic like languages. It is
  very simple, if You want a variable that should contain a number, use
  DEFL to define it, if You want a floating point number variable, use
  DEFF or DEFD.
