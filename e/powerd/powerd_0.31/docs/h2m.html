<ul type=square>
<li><big>What it is:</big><br>
  H2M is an utility that can convert c-header (#?.h) files to d-modules
  (#?.m).
  Source code is included in PowerD archive ('d:source/h2m.d'). You can
  do with it everything you like except of selling it :)
<br><br>

<li><big>Limitations:</big><br>
  It is very difficult to make such converter, because of macros, which
  can use also c-code. And this can't be converter to d-code in a simple
  way. When You convert a module which has such macros, You have to
  correct them to usable code handy. Sorry.<br><br>
  Macros are slightly changed to be more d-comparible:
<font color=#ff0000><pre>
  "  (doublequote)     will be converted to ' (apostrophe)
  '  (apostrophe)      will be converted to ' (doublequote)
  -> (c-object member) will be converted to . (d-object member)
  0x (c-hexdec header) will be converted to $ (d-hexdec header)
  #L (constant long)   will be converted to # where # is a hex/dec number
</pre></font>
<br><br>

<li><big>Features:</big><br>
  It saves (some) comments.<br>
  If aligns OBJECT definition comments.
<br><br>

<li><big>How to use it:</big><br>
  It has only one argument:
<font color=#0000ff><pre>
  h2m SOURCE/A
</pre></font><br>
  Where SOURCE should be a c-header file without '.h' extension.
  It will write file with same name, but with extension '.m'.<br><br>

<li><big>Example:</big>
<font color=#0000ff><pre>
  1.> h2m include:intuition/screens
</pre></font><br>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
