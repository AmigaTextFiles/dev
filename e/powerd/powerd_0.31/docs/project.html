<li><big>Description</big><br>
  If You have ever written some longer program, You discovered that it
  will be much better to separate it to more that just one source. PowerD
  Project Compiler will do this stuff for You. It contains a little
  intelligence and it will compile only files that were changed.
  powerd_fpu.lib will be linked automaticaly.
<br><br>

<li><big>Usage</big><br>
  PowerD project compiler (pc) has several arguments:
<font color=#0000ff><pre>
  pc FROM/A,A=ALL/S,DS=DEBUGSYM/S,MS=MONAMSYM/S,AI=ASMINFO/S,R=RUN/S,NW=NOWARN/S
</pre></font><br>
  <font color=#0000ff>FROM</font> is the project name with or without '.dpr' extension.<br>
  <font color=#0000ff>ALL</font> will compile all files from the project, also files which weren't changed.<br>
  <font color=#0000ff>DEBUGSYM</font> will compile files with debugging symbols.<br>
  <font color=#0000ff>ASMINFO</font> will compile files with 'dc ASMINFO' to make assembler sources better readable.<br>
  <font color=#0000ff>RUN</font> will execute compiled executable file.<br>
  <font color=#0000ff>NOWARN</font> will not show warnings.<br>
<br>

<li><big>Features</big><br>
  If no <font color=#0000ff>ALL</font> switch enabled, pc will compare
  each object file and source file dates and if source file is younger,
  it will be compiled, if the source file is older than the object file
  it will be skipped and only linked.
<br><br>

<li><big>History</big><br>
  <ul type=disc>
  <li>0.1 to 0.3 - I can't remember :P
  <li>0.4 - rewritten from E to D, changed project file format, removed
    some bugs. Added error output. Added NOWARN switch. Removed MONAMSYM
    switch (now it is handled automaticaly)
  </ul>
<br><br>

<li><big>Future</big><br>
  <ul type=disc>
  <li>different names for source and object files
  <li>more options
  <li>gui
  <li>your ideas?
  </ul>
<br><br>

<li><big>Project file</big><br>
  Each project file MUST start with string 'PowerD Project v1' on the
  first line (this is case dependent).
  PC recognizes also comments leading with // or bounded with /* and */.
  All object files should be introduced with OBJ or OBJECT keywords
  (case independent). Object files must be defined with .o extension
  and it's sources must have the same name with extension .d. Path can
  be entered both relative (//obj/obj.o) and absolute (src:obj/obj.o).
  All library files should be introduced with LIB keyword.
  Then You can define also startup (header) file with HEAD or HEADER or
  STARTUP keyword. If none of these keywords found, default startup file
  (d:lib/startup.o) will be used instead. And finally You MUST define
  output executable file name via one of EXE, OUT and OUTPUT keywords.
<br><br>

<li><big>Example</big>
<font color=#0000ff><pre>
  PowerD Project v1

  // main source file:
  obj='src:draw.o'

  // rest objects:
  obj='src:gfx/drawmesh.o'
  obj='src:io/loadmesh.o'

  // executeble file:
  exe='src:draw'
</pre></font><br>
  Let's call this file 'project.dpr' then You can enter:
<font color=#0000ff><pre>
  pc project run
</pre></font><br>
  then files 'src:draw.d', 'src:gfx/drawmesh.d', 'src:io/loadmesh.d' will
  be compiled if needed. These files will be linked together with
  'd:lib/startup.o' header and 'd:lib/powerd_fpu.lib' library into the
  'src:draw' executable. This file will be launched.
</ul>
