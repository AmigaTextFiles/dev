@NODE Introduction "Introduction"
    Let's have a little trip in the past. Some times ago, I found on a fish
disk an excellent little program named Deft (© 1992, Gary Smith). Its goal
was vey simple : change the icon default tools. Let's take a using example.
Suppose that you get used to reading your documentations with More program.
In this case, all your documentation icons have as default tool something
like "SYS:Utilities/more". And then, a nice day, you discover the fabulous
Most. And of course, starting this moment, you don't want to hear about
More ever (and I agree ! :)). But change all your default tool fields of
your documentation icons may be a HUDGE task if your hard drive is a big
one. It's at his point that Deft comes up. You give it a path, an old
default tool, a new default tool, and goooo, it makes all the replacements
on your hard drive. Briefly, Deft is (for my point of view) a typical PD
program : too small to be commercial, but genius for the idea, and
dramatically useful (we don't need it often, but when we need it, we are
REALLY happy to have it !!!).


	You probably guess it, Deft II is a new version (starting from nothing
as I hadn't Deft sources) of Deft. This program seemed to be undevelopped
for a long a time, so I allow myself to rewrite it, adding -I hope- a lot
of enhancements, namely :
        - a MUI GUI with all the consequent convenience for the user
(keyboard shortcuts, appwindows, etc)
        - multi-paths handling for scanning
        - multi-default tools for replacing
        - wildcard using for the default tools to replace
        - preferences saving
        - ARexx support
        - online help

    About this documentation reading, read completely the chapter @{" using " Link Utilisation}.
All that you need to know is there. The chapter about @{" the GUI " Link Interface} is in
fact used for the online help, and thus, may be used as a reference
document. Finally, if you are an ARexx wizard, have a look on the chapter
@{" ARexx " Link ARexx}.

WARNIGN : Deft II needs 2.0 Workbench or newer to run, and MUI v2.1
properly installed.
@ENDNODE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Installation "Installation"
    If you have the Installer program, just let you guide !

    If it isn't the case, don't panic ! Deft II is a very simple program
which can be installed easily and without pain manually :

1) Copy all the files "Deft II", "Deft II.info", "Deft II.prefs",
"Deft II.guide" (the one which corresponds to your language), and
"Deft II.guide.info" inside a SAME directory of your choice.

2) Copy "DeftII_Test.rexx" inside REXX:.

3) Copy the "DeftII.catalog" file which corresponds to your language if
it is available and if your Workbench supports localization (normally only
Workbench versions newer or equal to 2.1 support it) inside the system
directory "LOCALE:Catalogs/votre_langue/".

4) (optional) Copy the "Sources/" directory where you want.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Utilisation "Using"
    Let's see first a little @{" tutorial "	Link Didacticiel} about Deft II using.
Then let's follow with this fondamental and serious question : 
@{" But how does the author himself use his program ? "	Link Mon_Utilisation} :)
@ENDNODE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Didacticiel "Tutorial"
    Open the unique window of Deft II. This one can be split into three
parts :
        - on the left the 'Default tools' group
        - on the right the 'Paths' group
        - on the bottom the text gadget 'File' and the 'Deft II controls'
group

    The 'Default tools' group is used to define which default tools Deft II
will have to replace, and by which new default tools it will have to
replace them.
    Each old/new default tool pair is displayed in this order inside the
list. To enter such a pair, use the two string gadgets 'Old' and 'New'.
Note that the pair is enregistered when (and only when) you strike the
enter key inside the text gadget 'New'. Note also that Deft II doesn't
accept a pair if the old default tool is empty or if it already exists a
pair with the same old default tool. But it's possible to enter a pair with
the new default tool empty. This pair will be then displayed in italic
inside the list to signal you that the definition of this pair is
incomplete.
    The old default tool may have wildcars (not the new one of course !).
For instance, "#?more#?" is a possible old default tool. During the
replacement stage, Deft II will search among all the project icons located
inside the paths to scan if one has a default tool which matches this
pattern, and will perform, in case of matching, the replacement. You can
thus replace very easily the "c/more", "c:more" and other ":c/MuchMore" by
"c:Most" ! Better, you can without any trouble ask Deft II to replace all
the "#?guide#?" by "c:AmigaGuide" because Deft II check before a
replacement that it isn't going to replace a string by itself. So, a
default tool like "C:amigaguide" (note that Deft II is case insensitive),
won't be replaced whereas ":c/AmigaGuide" will.
    The popup gadget on the right of the string gadget 'New' opens a little
list where all the new default tools already entered in Deft II are : you
can thus select one without needing to type it again. But the first time,
you can use the popfile gadget on the right of the popup gadget. This opens
a file requester where you can choose a new default tool.
    Double-clicking on a pair in the list enables you to edit it.
    You can drop on the list and on the 'Old' string of the 'Default tools'
group some project icons. If you do, the default tools of these icons will
be immediately added (if they weren't already there of course) in the list.
In these case, they will appear in italic because they haven't yet a
corresponding default tool.
    Finally, you can drop on the 'New' string of the 'Default tools' group
a tool icon. If you do, this one will appear in this string. This does the
same as the "popfile" gadget on the right of this string.

    The 'Paths' group is used to define the paths to recursively scan
during the replacement stage, paths which are displayed in a list. If you
drop an icon to this group, the path of the file or of the drawer is added
to the paths list. Double-clicking on a path in the list enables you to
edit it.

    Finally, you can use the 'Deft II controls' group to run the default
tools replacement stage (button 'GO !!!'), to stop the replacement stage at
any moment (button 'Stop') or to save the preferences (button 'Save
prefs'), preferences which hold the two list contents. During the
replacement stage, Deft II displays inside the text gadget 'File' all the
files whose icon is modified by Deft II.
@ENDNODE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Mon_Utilisation "How I use myself Deft II..."
    I personally configured Deft II to use it in the case of a replacement
on my hard drive. In other words, the preferences I saved hold all my hard
drive partitions inside the paths list.

    However a frequent case when the default tool replacement is needed
appears during a new program test (thing I usually do in RAM: or SD0:).
Indeed, it's often the case that, when I click on the installation icon or
on the documentation icon, the Workbench doesn't find the right default
tool. To solve this problem, I run before starting my tests Deft II by a
hotkey from ToolManager. Deft II starts then iconified (thing to configure
with MUI-Prefs if you are a register user). Then for each new test in RAM:
or in SD0: (i.e. for each new archive unarchived), I run, always with an
hotkey from ToolManager (I love this program :)), a little ARexx script,
"DeftII_test.rexx". This one clears the path list of Deft II replacing them
by "RAM: and "SD0:", and just after runs the replacement stage (so located
in RAM: and SD0:). Once this one finished, it re-builds the path list as it
found it at starting. In other words, thanks to this little ARexx script
and to ToolManager, I can perform a very fast replacement (RAM operation
and Deft II is always iconified) of the default tools for each new archive
during its test stage, and all this without loosing my configuration of
Deft II, this last one sticked to my hard drive partitions.

    So I advise you to try this ARexx script, even if you aren't a wizard
of this language (I put all the required comments in order you can adapt it
to your needs). For my point of view, it completely automates Deft II
using.

    To help you, I provided in this archive my own Deft II preferences
file.

    If you drop a project icon on the list or on the 'Old' string of this
group, its default tool will be automagically added to this list (if it
isn't already there of course) as "old default tool". It hasn't yet a
corresponding "new default tool".
    If you drop a tool icon on the 'New' string of this group, this one

@NODE lv_default_tools "The list"
    Displays all the old/new default tool pairs known by Deft II. If a
pair hasn't a new default tool, it is displayed in italic.
    Double-click on a pair in this list to edit it.
@ENDNODE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE stR_old_def_tool "The string 'Old'"
    Enter in this string an old default tool to replace.
@ENDNODE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE po_new_def_tool "The popobject gadget 'New'"
    Enter in this string by which new default tool Deft II must replace the
associated old default tool. Strike the ENTER key inside this string to
validate the current edited pair.
    If you click on the popup image on the right of the string, it opens a
list of the new default tools already entered in Deft II. Double-click on
one entry of this list to select it.
    If you click on the popfile image on the right of the popup image, this
opens a file requester to choose a new default tool to put in the string.

@NODE bt_go "The 'GO !!!' button"
    Starts the replacement stage : Deft II recursively scan all the given
paths, and change the "default tool" field of each icon where this field
mathes an "old default tool" to the "new default tool" associated.

    The old default tool may be an AmigaDos pattern and Deft II checks
before the replacement that the current "default tool" field isn't the same
than the "new default tool" associated.
@ENDNODE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE bt_stop "The 'Stop' button"
    Enables you to stop a any moment the replacement stage.
    Without effect in the other cases.
@ENDNODE

the user before its normal end. Finally, 100 is added to this return code
if a serious error has prevented Deft II from the access of a file or a
directory. In this case, Deft II immediately stops its activities while
freeing all the ressources it owns.
    To sum up, the possible return codes are 5, 10, 15, 100 and 110.
@ENDNODE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE ARexx_loose_modifications "ARexx command 'loose_modifications'"

the user being annoyed by a confirmation requester when he will want to
quit Deft II.
@ENDNODE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE Sources "The sources"
    All the sources of Deft II are provided. So you can recompile this
program without any trouble. For this, you need Mac2E v4.0 in addition of
Amiga E v3.0a. If you followed the installation instructions of these
programs, the command "build" would be enough. A thing to note : all the
files which have ".ema" for extension instead of ".e" are E source files
which contains macros. So you must first call Mac2E to give them this ".e"
extension and then compile them with EC.

    However don't forget that modifications to the files of this
distribution is only allowed for your strictly personal usage (see
@{" distribution " Link Distribution}) ! If you find a bug and fix it, please, write
to me in order I make a new version, thanks.
    The main reason for which I provided all the sources is of course that
they can be used as examples for other programers. I myself took a lot of
benefit from other programer sources, so I hope that the chain will
continue :).

    Finally, I precise that I joined the ".cd" and ".ct" files to let you
re-build the catalog for your language. If you make such a catalog, don't
forget to send it to me in order I can include it in the future released
versions, thanks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@NODE A_Faire "To do"
    I have in mind to write a commodity in addition of Deft II which would
patch the system to change in real time the default tools. Of course, this
one would use the preferences de Deft II. But for the moment, it's just an
idea, not a project.

    Apart this I don't see anything to add to Deft II, except fixing bugs
of course. But I'm opened to every reasonable suggestion (see
@{" the author " Link Auteur}).

@NODE Distribution "Distribution"
    @{b} All the files of this distribution stay under the copyright of the
author (Lionel Vintenat)@{ub}. You are allowed to modify them only for your
STRICTLY PERSONAL usage.
    The only exceptions are the "Readme.mui" file and the icons.


    This archive can be @{b}freely distributed@{ub} by any thinkable ways
(ftp server, BBS, public domain collection, etc), as long as the two
following conditions are respected :

    1) @{b}No person gains ANY benefit from this distribution@{ub}. In
particular, if Deft II is spread on a floppy disk, this one can't be sold
for more than 4$ US (or equivalent), and if it is spread on a CDROM, this
one can't be sold for more than 30$ US (or equivalent). No other type of
sale (with benefit) can be made IN ANY CASES without the author's
authorization. The only exceptions are the Fred Fish's and aminet CDROMs,
who they (and only them !) can include Deft II in their collections without
asking me the permission first. In particular, this excludes DEFINITIVELY
to France Festival Distribution the right to distribute Deft II (I insist
HEAVILY on this point...). But maybe this won't annoy too much Mr Serge
Hammouche, who doesn't hesitate to call (openly on some French nets) French
PD programers incapable...

    2) @{b}This archive is distributed IN IT'S ENTIRETY, and without
MODIFICATIONS compared to the original version on aminet@{ub}. This means
in particular that if you make a translation of the documentation or of the
catalog in a new language, or if you fix some bugs and re-compile the
executable, you MUST send them to me in order I EVENTUALLY (pretty sure in
fact for translations) redistribute a new version of this program. The
file structure this archive must have is given in the "ReadMe.first" file
of this distribution.

    Any distribution of Deft II which doesn't respect the two previous
conditions without my authorization is @{b}ILLEGAL@{ub}.


    All the begining of this paragraph may seem very strict, even close to
the paranoia, but knowing the dubious practices of people like Serge
Hammouche who sells for HUDGE prices (under translation excuse) some freely
distribuable softwares without even informing the authors, I think it's
necessary to protect my rights. I make programs for my pleasure without any
claim to earn money, and I'm happy if they may help other persons, but that
some people make money from my work : NO ! The previous limitations doesn't
aim in any way serious people like Fred Fish, the Montréal Amiga Club, the
aminet system operators, or all the clubs of fascinated people, who, them,
really support the Amiga domain public. They only aim the organizations
with discutable pratices like France Festival Distribution.


    Moreover, I cannot be held responsible for the use of this program and
any damages that it may cause directly or not. I want this to be clear :
@{b}YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK !@{ub}
    However, I think I tested and I made people test it enough to say that
it doesn't contain any serious bug.


    Finally, this program is distributed under @{b}giftware@{ub} concept.
In other words, you must send me a gift if you use Deft II ! :)

    Indeed, I make programs for my pleasure and by need. My goal is
certainly not to earn money with. However to distribute a program ask for
some extra work (documentations, installer script, etc), so I'd like to
receive a feedback from those who will use Deft II. In fact, any sign of
life will be VERY appreciated, even a simple e-mail or a postcard. What I
am the more interested in is contact with other persons. But to help you to
choose my gift, here are some suggestions :) :
        - a (free !) registration to a shareware program
        - one of your realizations (program, module, animation, picture,
etc) if it isn't easy to retrieve it from aminet
        - some sourves
        - some E, C or assembly sources which are closed to the
programation of the system, or even False or BrainFuck sources (they can
be closed of anything, provided they work ! :))
        - some money, hummmm, why not ? :)
        - your old 1.3 RKM (or better 2.0)

    I insist on the fact that it's very frustrating to make the effort to
put his program in the freely distribuable domain wihtout never receiving
any feedback, just guessing that some people use your program ! So please
support the giftware concept, everybody break even : the author is happy to
receive a feedback, and it costs almost nothing to the users.

@NODE Auteur "The author"
    You can reach me by snail-mail at my family address :

            @{b}Lionel Vintenat@{ub}
            3 impasse Boileau
            Lotissement Les Termes
            87270 COUZEIX
            FRANCE

    You can also reach me on the internet. My e-mail address is
@{b}vintenat@irit.fr@{ub}. This one will probably be reliable until
September 1994 included, but I won't have access to it cause of
holydays/military service until this September month. So don't rely too
much on a quick reply if you use this address ! If you really want to reach
me until there, the best is to directly write to me to my family address
(don't forget to do it with a nice postcard from you country 8) ).

    The best solution is for my point of view to wait for new signs of life
from me on the net starting September 1994, because I will have at this
moment a new internet address reliable for all the new school year.
