@title "Introduction"
0A. introduction
----------------
E Developer Professional is a texteditor with an environment where
you can run, debug, profile and compile your program direct from a menu
choice.

Other feature:
If you, like me, always have to fix the "layout" of the program after
coding a couple of hours, you know how boring it is to delete spaces
and tabs and insert new ones to make the code look good. Now the problem
is solved, just press the "indent all icon" and your program gets a good
layout.

There is also an intelligent Auto indent function. Just press Return
after each line and let EDevProf fix the rest.

If you want the editor can show the keywords, strings, etc in different
colours to make the code more easy to read. 

A listview with all the procedures in the program. You can jump to a 
procedure with just a mouseclick.

Friendly userinterface to all the compiler options.

Userinterface to add, del and show modules.

Undo function.

@title "User and install instructions"
0D. using the editor
----------------------

To install E Developer Professional on your system, just copy the whole
distribution to some place in your system. 

You can start EDevProf from Workbench, but you must have iconx. If you
start EDevProf from CLI make sure that you are in the same directory as
all the EDevProf files.

If you have an assign to the "bin" directory in E you should enter
it in the Settings-Compiler...-E dir:, if you don't you should add
the "bin" directory to your paths in the startup-sequence.

If you have an E compiler another name than EC, you should enter it
in the Settings-Compiler...-Compilername:. For example: ECDEMO.

If your settings becomes VERY bad just delete the file settings.ed
and the file palette.ed. DO NOT delete any other files.

Known bugs:

You must press return in a stringgadget, otherwise the string
is not stored.

The colour-settings-requester doesn't update properly.

For you who knows little about E: 
 I use Easygui for the requesters, which is easy but
 doesn't have any functions to update the requester.
 In my program you will se that it's not so good to
 use in reallity, too bad. I hope there will be an update.

Functions to do in future versions:
Screen selector

Help function, just press help on a function and you will get
help and a example.

Better undo function.

Fix bugs.
