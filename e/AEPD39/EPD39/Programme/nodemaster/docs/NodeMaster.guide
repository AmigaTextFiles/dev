@node "NodeMaster_introduction" "Introduction"
NodeMaster  is  a generic object handling module which will allow you to easily
create  lists  of  whatever  you  want.   Its  generic  structure  is ideal for
polimorphism  and  inheritance in other objects.  This object just take care of
creating  Exec  Lists  and  Nodes  of something you pass to it (we will call it
"object")  and  then  it has great power in Lists manipulation.  You can easily
add/del nodes from the list, go to a specific item by its ordinal number and so
on...

I have worked out this module structuring it on Amiga Exec's Nodes. This means
that everything you will add/remove to a NodeMaster will be done on a System List
Node.

This code is very Exec List-based, so you can do whatever you want.

Main features are:

    * Push/Pop commands to save/restore a special node position.

    * Insert command to add a object AFTER another (usually it is added as Last
      node)

    * Search command to scan trought the list looking for a string.

    * Item   command to go to a specific item by its ordinal number.

NEW V2.0 Version features:

    * New method pos() which returns the actual ordinal node position!

    * Enhanced item() method: now it does not scans from first() item to
      selected, but just +/- delta objects from the starting point.

    * Internal sniff-snuff ;)

    * NO MORE ENFORCER'S HITS! ;)

    * Returns Raise() errors instead of return codes!!

    * More examples!

@node "example" "Example Program"

    With NodeMaster_oo two examples are provided:

    The first one is a _GREAT_ example, which opens as many EasyGUIs as
    you want (memory limiting...) and handle events from all of them ;)

    The second is just a demo of pos() and item() command based upon strings.

    PLEASE, refer to StringNode.lha archive for a demo of NodeMaster and
    StringNode objects (this one inherits all methods of NodeMaster ;)


    Thank You!

@node "NodeMaster_NodeMaster" "AmigaE Modules: NodeMaster/NodeMaster()"
           NAME: NodeMaster()

    DESCRIPTION: Use this command to inizialize a NodeMaster object.

          INPUT: NONE.

        RESULTS: NONE.

@node "NodeMaster_add" "AMIGA-E Modules: NodeMaster/add()"
           NAME: add(object:PTR TO LONG, mode=SN_ADD_TAIL)

    DESCRIPTION: Use this command to add an object to the list.

          INPUT: object         - PTR TO LONG. This is the object to add.
                 mode           - (OPTIONAL) This flag is very useful to
                                  choose _where_ a new node will be added.
                                  Default is as last one, but you can
                                  add it as the first line or in the middle
                                  of the list (same as insert() command).

                                  Possible values are:

                                  SN_ADD_HEAD - Use this one to add the node
                                                as the first in list.

                                  SN_ADD_HERE - Use this one to add the node
                                                AFTER the current one.
                                                (Same as insert() method)

                                  SN_ADD_TAIL - (Default) Use this one to add
                                                the node as the last in list.

           NOTE: It is not safe to use mode SN_ADD_HERE (same as insert) if you
                 do not know what you are doing: if there are no items
                 unpredictable results may occur... it could also work
                 properly, but I have not tested! ;)

        RESULTS: NOTHING      - Everything went on fine.
                 Raise("MEM") - In case of Memory problems.

@node "NodeMaster_addr" "Amiga-E Modules: NodeMaster/addr()                            "
           NAME: addr()

    DESCRIPTION: Use this command to get the addr of the Exec List.

          INPUT: NONE.

        RESULTS: A PTR TO lh  (an Exec List Header).

           NOTE: This command is useful expecially with ListView gadgets
                 which requires a PTR TO an Exec List Header. All you have
                 to do is:
                    Gt_SetGadgetAttrsA(listgad, win, req, [
                        GTLV_LABELS, NodeMasterobj.addr(), 0,0])

                 And the ListView will show your new list.
                 Please refer to RMKM and autodocs for more infos regarding
                 Gadtools and ListViews.

                 If the node you deleted was the last one, then the next
                 will be the previous one.

        RESULTS: NONE.

           NOTE: The current node WILL NOT change!!!

@node "NodeMaster_item" "Amiga-E Modules: NodeMaster/item()"
           NAME: item(numitem)

    DESCRIPTION: Use this command to position current node to the ordinal
                 numitem node.

          INPUT: numitem     - LONG. Ordinal value of node position.

        RESULTS: NONE.

          NOTES: From V2.00 this method changes a bit. Now it scans prev() or
                 succ() item starting from the current position. So it is
                 faster, but you have to be careful.
                 If you use the method changepos(), the internal ordinal
                 position is not changed. So you have to do a first() method
                 before calling item().

                 In any case, if you think that something in your source could
                 behaves differently, just do a first() method call and
                 everything will behaves as always.

                 Also pop() and push() do not update internal ordinal position.
                 Do a first() also before an item() after them.

           NOTE: * If no node was Push()ed the current node won't change.

                 * From V2.00 it does not restore the internal ordinal number.
