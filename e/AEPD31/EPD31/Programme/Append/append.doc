append() - Copyright © 2-Jul-1995 by Maik "BLiZZeR" Schreiber
=============================================================

append() does nothing more than Open() does - it opens a file and returns
the file handle of it. But append() is used to append data to files
(just as the name implies ;-).

If a file could be opened because it already existed, the "write cursor"
will be positioned to the end of the file. If the file couldn't be opened
"old", it will be created new.


Usage
~~~~~
This is an example usage:

  IF handle:=append(filename)
         .
         .

    Close(handle)
  ENDIF


handle   - the usual filehandle as with Open()
filename - the filename as with Open()
