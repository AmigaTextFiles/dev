checkbin() - Copyright © 2-Jul-1995 by Maik "BLiZZeR" Schreiber
===============================================================

checkbin() is a simple binary check for files. It reads a number of bytes
from a file which will then be checked.

The following ASCII codes are indicators for binary files:
0-8, 11-12, 14-26, 28-31 und 128-159.


Usage
-----

bin:=checkbin(filename,checklength)

bin         - TRUE, if the file is binary, FALSE if not
filename    - path to a file to be checked (eg. "RAM:test")
checklength - the number of bytes of the file to be checked (can even be
              more than the length of the file)
