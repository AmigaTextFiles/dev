Document Logic.doc

This document describes the various goings-on with Logic.m
and its various derivatives.

1. Logic

Logic, derived from Object, handles logical statements.  I
will likely change its name in the future due to further
considerations (logical terms are different from
statements).

All logical statements have truth, therefore, truth is its
only attribute.  Truth is always either TRUE, FALSE, or
UNDETERMINED.  Unfortunately, Amiga E has already assigned
values to those three constants, so for my purposes, TRUE is
'1', FALSE is '-1', and UNDETERMINED is '0'.  Fortunately, I
have ways of testing this information without having to
resort to clumsy IF/THEN statements.. more on this later.


PROC if(q,a=0,b=0)

This is the only procedure that isn't actually part of the
logic object.  This may change in the future.  All
parameters (q, a, and b) will be Eval()uated, and must
therefore be "`" expressions... I chose to do things this
way in order to save space, and in order to do things more
easily.  I couldn't find another way to allow users to call
their object's methods arbitrarily from within this function.

Basically, 'q' should return either TRUE or FALSE (in the
classic Amiga E sense).  If a or b has a value other than 0,
a will be Eval()ed if q Eval()s to TRUE, b if q Eval()s to
FALSE.  If a is missing, and q indicates TRUE, then TRUE
will be returned.  If b is missing, and q indicates FALSE,
then FALSE will be returned.

So, in essence, this procedure acts as a very sophisticated
IF THEN ELSE statement, but in a much more easily readable
format.  This will become particularly useful as you read.

        write()

This method will print 'This statement is' followed by
either True, False, or Undetermined, depending on the value
of truth.  This method will not exist in the future... it
will be replaced with something more flexible.. currently,
it will only write to stdout.

        ifDetermined(a,b)

This method tests if truth is determined, Eval()ing a if so,
b if not so.

        ifUndetermined(a,b)

This method tests if truth is undetermined, Eval()ing a if
so, b if not so.

        ifFalse(a,b)

This method tests if truth is false, Eval()ing a if so, b if
not so.

        ifTrue(a,b)

This method tests if truth is true, Eval()ing a if so, b if
not so.

        isDetermined()

This method returns TRUE if truth is either true or false.

        isUndetermined()

This method returns TRUE if truth is undetermined.

        isFalse()

This method returns TRUE if truth is false.

        isTrue()

This method returns TRUE if truth is true.

        copy(a)

This method allows you to copy a Logic statement.  If a is
missing, it will create a new one.  If a is not missing, it
will simply copy the contents of its truth to the incoming
Logic statement.

        beUndetermined()

This method forces truth to be undetermined.

        beFalse()

This method forces truth to be false.

        beTrue()

This method forces truth to be true.

        new(a)

This method allows one to create a new instantiation of the
Logic object.  'a' is an E list that may have the following:

"set"	-- Sets the truth value to the following item.
"true"	-- Sets truth to true.
"fals"	-- Sets truth to false.

The truth attribute always starts off undetermined.

1.1. Catprop

Categorical propositions are simply statements that manage
categories of things.  They come in four flavors: A, E, I,
and O:

A:	All a are b.
E:	No a are b.
I:	Some a are b.
O:	Some a are not b.

This object allows you to set up a categorical proposition,
and either generate new ones from it, or change it to other
related categorical propositions.

1.1.1. Catprop's attributes

(  8)   flag:LONG

The flag holds information detailing whether the instance is
Universal or Particular, and whether the instance is
Affirmative or Negative.  From these values we can determine
what kind of Categorical Proposition we're dealing with.

At the moment, it also holds whether or not the
subject/predicate is a non-type (that is, 'non-cats'
as opposed to 'cats').

( 12)   sub:LONG

This holds the subject for the proposition.

( 16)   pred:LONG

This holds the predicate for the proposition.

1.1.2. Catprop's methods

        notSubject()

This will change the subject so it is a non- statement.

        notPredicate()

This will change the predicate so it is a non- statement.

        subject(a)

This changes the subject to 'a'.

        predicate(a)

This changes the predicate to 'a'.

        subpred(a,b)

This changes the subject to 'a' and the predicate to 'b'.

        beUniversal()

This makes the statement a Universal statement (All, No).

        beParticular()

This makes the statement a Particular statement (Some).

        beAffirmative()

This makes the statement an Affirmative statement (All,
are).

        beNegative()

This makes the statement a Negative statement (No, are not).

        isUniversal()

This returns TRUE if the statement is Universal.

        isParticular()

This returns TRUE if the statement is Particular.

        isAffirmative()

This returns TRUE if the statement is Affirmative.

        isNegative()

This returns TRUE if the statement is Negative.

        ifUniversal(a,b)

If the statement is Universal, 'a' is Eval()uated, otherwise
'b'.  Values left out will return TRUE or FALSE.

        ifParticular(a,b)

If the statement is Particular, 'a' is Eval()uated, otherwise
'b'.  Values left out will return TRUE or FALSE.

        ifAffirmative(a,b)

If the statement is Affirmative, 'a' is Eval()uated, otherwise
'b'.  Values left out will return TRUE or FALSE.

        ifNegative(a,b)

If the statement is Negative, 'a' is Eval()uated, otherwise
'b'.  Values left out will return TRUE or FALSE.

        beContradiction()

This changes the statement to be a contradiction of itself,
setting the truth value accordingly.

        beSubalternation()

This changes the statement to be a subalternation of itself,
setting the truth value accordingly.

        beContrary()

This changes the statement to be contrary to itself, setting
the truth value accordingly.

        beSubcontrary()

This changes the statement to be subcontrary to itself,
setting the truth value accordingly.

        asConversion()

This returns a copy of the statement as a conversion of the
original statement.  NIL if it fails.

        asObversion()

This returns a copy of the statement as an obversion of the
original statement. NIL if it fails.

        asContraposition()

This returns a copy of the statement as a controposition of

        beConversion()

This changes the statement to be a conversion of itself, if
possible.

        beObversion()

This changes the statement to be an obversion of itself, if
possible.

        beContraposition()

This will write the statement to stdio, including its truth
value.
