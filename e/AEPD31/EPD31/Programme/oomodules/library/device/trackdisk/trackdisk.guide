      readblock(tracknumber,drive=0)

The track will be read in the object's buffer which can be accessed via a
simple

  object.buffer


NOTE: the drive's motor is not automatically turned off, you have to do this
by yourself using the method motor().

As you can see the drive number is optional. If the object has opened a drive
already that parameter will be ignored. If a drive has not been opened and you
omit that parameter, the internal drive will be opened.

      writeblock(number,drive=0)

It writes the contents of the object's buffer to the specified track of the
disk you specified on opening the drive. If no drive has been opened already
the second argument will be used as the number of the drive to write to.

      motor(flag=FALSE,drive=0)

This method turn the drive's motor on (flag=TRUE) or off (flag=FALSE). If no
drive is open by call time, the the second argument will be used as the number
of the drive to open.

      getchangenum()

Returns the number of times a disk was inserted/removed in/from a drive.
Actually this method is only useful for internal use, maybe in the future it's
private.

      open(name,unit,flags)

If you call this method without any arguments, drive 0 will be opened. To open
the device for access to any other floppy, call it with unit set to the
drive's number (DF0 = 0, DF1 = 1...).

      diskindrive(drive=0)

This method returns TRUE, if a disk is inserted in the drive opened. If no
drive is open, the second argument is used as the number of the drive to be
opened.

      diskprotected(drive=0)

This method tests the inserted disk on it's write protection and returns TRUE,
if it's protected.

If no drive is open, the second argument will be used as the number of the
drive to be opened.
