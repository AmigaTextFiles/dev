This guide tells you everything about the object 'Library'

@node "attributes" "Library - Attributes"

  version

  Contains the version of the library. It can be set manually or via new().
  Up to now it does not contain the version of the library that was opened,
  i.e. if you leave the 0 in it you get any version of that library if it
  could be opened. This may change.

  name

  The name of the library, e.g. 'gadtools.library'.

  base

  The address of the library's base.
@endnode

@node "methods" "Library - Methods"

        init()

  The inheriting library objects should set the name and version attributes.
  NOTE WELL: The base attribute has to be set accordingly, e.g.

    base := self.base
    ^base := {reqtools.library}

        open(name, version, dummy)

  Opens the library and sets the base attribute. If the library could not
  be opened the exception "LIB" is raised.
  The dummy argument is provided for the 'Device' object. Since that one does
  also use the method open and I needed three arguments there this was
  necessary. This may change.

        close()

  Closes the library if it was open.

        update()

  Just closes the library and opens it again with the same attributes.

        end()

  Closes the library automatically.
