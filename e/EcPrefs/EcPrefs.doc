 This program is useful to Amiga E programmers only.

 All coding is in assembler using Macro68, for speed
 and efficiency.

 Total memory usage less than 12k, no MUI, GadTools
 libs etc.

 Works with public screens, has font sensitive window.

 EC v. 32a will run on OS 1.3 and so will EcPrefs.

 Tested on my Amiga 3000 with Enforcer and on 'OS 1.3'
 and 'OS 3.1'.

 ECPrefs is POSTCARDWARE, so there are no guarantees with
 this program, although all reasonable care has been taken.

 If you find ECPrefs helpful or would like to see
 improvements, then send a post card to;

 PO. Box 7, Forest Hill 4342, Q.L.D, Australia.

 ECPrefs with no command line arguments will bring up
 the program's GUI. With the menu and buttons you can
 setup the EC compiler flags, for Edbug, Aprof etc.

 You can use the keys, 1 to 9, and letters 'U', 'S' as
 keyboard shortcuts. There are also menu shortcuts.

 All information can then be saved to an environment
 file in ENV: or ENVARC:, with the name EC.prefs.

 All this is to make life easier when using Arexx. :-)

 The following example is from part of my compile script.

 IF Exists('ENV:EC.prefs') THEN DO
 ok=Open(readhandle,'ENV:EC.prefs','read')
 optec=ReadLn(readhandle)
 ok=Close(readhandle)
 END
 ELSE optec=''
 'QUERY ANYTEXT'
 IF (result='TRUE') THEN 'QUERY DOC VAR filepath'
 IF (Upper(Right(result,2))='.E') THEN DO
 'QUERY MODIFY'
 IF (result='TRUE') THEN 'SAVE ALL'
 filename=Left(filepath,Length(filepath)-2)
 Address Command 'ExTools:EC > T:E-error 'optec' 'filename''
 'Beep'
 END
 ELSE
 DO
 'REQUEST BODY=' Not an Amiga E sources file.'
 END
 'UNLOCK'
 EXIT

 For a better understanding, on the ECPrefs buttons, please
 read the Amiga E docs.
