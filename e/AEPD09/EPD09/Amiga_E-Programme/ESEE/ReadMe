Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
ESEE is an Amiga E source development environment, based on the new
(but still in beta state) GoldED texteditor. GoldED is specificly
written for source editing and features a powerful set of editing
commands in a totally flexible and transparant style.

ESEE basicly consists of a GoldED configuration file, that turns it into
a total program development environment for E. The configuration depends
partly on ARexx and small assembler programs written by me. Along with
this configuration, there is an AmigaGuide, that is both a help document
for ESEE, as well as an online menu help guide.

ESEE tries to be the most userfriendly and easy development environment
for E. This also means it has to be fast. Thanks to GoldED and Amiga E,
this won't be a problem.

Just 'touch and go!' to compile your E sources from your (soon to be)
favorite source editor for E.
