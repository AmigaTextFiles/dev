@node guide "About this Guide"

                             @{b}About this Guide@{ub}

This guide describes the features of the ESEE 1.0.

This guide serves both as a helpguide, which can be opened by just
doubleclicking on its Workbench icon, and as an online menu help guide,
which is accessible from within the ESEE configuration of GoldED.

This guide is written using GoldED (Did you know the Folding feature of
GoldED is very handy for writing AmigaGuides? ;·).

The version number of this document is 1.0, and will always be the same
as the ESEE configuration version.

@node intro "ESEE Introduction"

                            @{b}ESEE Introduction@{ub}

The Amiga E programming language (See @{" About Amiga E " link amigae}) is becoming more
and more popular amongst Amiga programmers. Amiga E offers an amazingly
fast compiler that will compile your E sources into efficient, fast
executable programs.

The Amiga E Compiler combines a compiler, linker and assembler in one,
small executable. A very fast and powerful compiler.

Now, what the Amiga E Compiler is for COMPILING sources, ESEE tries to be
for EDITING sources. Therefore, we need a powerful editor that can be
adapted to edit E sources specificly. The ultimate candidate for this job
is GoldED (See @{" About GoldED " link golded}).

The configuration possibilities of this editor are so marvellous,
that I started to fully configure it to my nEEds :o) the day I
donwloaded it from Aminet.

Now, after a month or so, I have the almost perfect Amiga E Source Editor
Environment, and want to share this with all (future) Amiga E programmers.
The result of this is ESEE, the E Source Editor Environment.

In fact, ESEE is nothing more than my configuration of GoldED, including
some ARexx/Assembler support that I wrote, and the guide you are reading
right now. Also see @{" About this Guide " link guide}.

@node amigae "About AmigaE"

                              @{b}About Amiga E@{ub}

E is a procedural higher programming language, mainly influenced by
languages such as C and Modula 2. It is an all-purpose programming
language, and the Amiga implementation is specifically targeted at
programming system applications.

Some features of version 2.1b of AmigaE are:

- Fast compilation speed (10.000-35.000 lines/minute on an Amiga 500,
  with a 7 Mhz MC68000 and chip ram only).
- Produces small and fast executable from source in one go.
- True inline assembly with indentifier sharing.
- Module system for import of definitions/constants/functions,
  Commodore 2.04 includes are available as modules.
- Flexible and powerful type system with low-level polymorphism.
- Use of quoted expressions.
- Immediate and typed lists: build complex data structures, make taglists
  or vararg function calls on the fly.

See @{" Requirements " link requirements} for how to obtain a copy of Amiga E.

On Internet, there is also an Amiga E mailing list. The address is

@node golded "About GoldED"

                               @{b}About GoldED@{ub}

GoldED is a fast and very user friendly text editor meant for programming
purposes. It is fully based around the Amiga OS 2.1/3.x, has a good look,
feel and performance.

GoldED is basically event based, as the editor waits for events like the
press of a key, the selection of a menu item or the call from an ARexx
script. GoldED will perform the appropriate action to this event. As these
actions are not hard coded, the editor is extremely flexible. In fact, you
may assign any (and multiple) of the editor's internal functions to an
event.

Some features of version 0.96 of GoldED are:

- OS3.x look and functionallity, such as AppWindows.
- @{" Folding " link M6.14 8}, with unlimited nesting of folders.
- Fully customizable menus and easy to use requesters.
- ARexx port, via which scripts can access all internal commands.
- @{" Referencing " link M6.7}, for example to sources, modules, or AutoDocs etc.
- Automatic Phrase Completion, based on a @{" Dictionary " link M6.5}.
- Smooth display and fast scrolling.
- Unlimited number of windows.
- AutoCasing, based on a @{" Dictionary " link M6.5}.
- Automatic Indention, using definable (See @{" Indention... " link M6.4}) indent
  and outdent keywords.
- @{" Section " link M2.8.0} window, where you can choose and jump to your source
  procedures with the click of a mouse.
- and many, many more...:o)

Read the AmigaGuide coming with the GoldED release to know more about its
features.

GoldED is written and copyrighted by Dietmar Eilert. The demo release
(of version 0.96) offers you the ability to use its full functionality
with only one restriction: Saving and printing is restricted to files
containing less than 1000 lines.

See @{" Requirements " link requirements} for how to obtain a copy of GoldED.
@endnode

@node requirements "ESEE Requirements"

                            @{b}ESEE Requirements@{ub}

ESEE needs the following additional software:

- The Amiga E compiler, version 2.1b. On Aminet: 'dev/e/amigae21b.lha'.

- The Amiga E module texts. On Aminet 'dev/e/amigaedocs.lha'. These
  modules in textform are not needed by the compiler, but are handy if
  you want to @{" reference " link M6.7} to the modules.

- The GoldED editor, version 0.96. On Aminet: 'util/edit/ged096.lha', or a
  registered copy. If you use it, take the last option and register...

- The ReqTools library by Nico François. On Aminet:
  'util/misc/ReqTools21f.lha'.

- The AmigaGuide library. On Aminet: 'fish/ff870/AmigaGuide.lha'.

Now read @{" ESEE Installation " link installation} to get going!
@endnode
@node installation "ESEE Installation"

                           @{b}ESEE Installation@{ub}

As ESEE is based on GoldED, you need to install GoldED. This can be done
by using the Installer script which comes with the GoldED distribution.

As ESEE is meant for Amiga E, you have to install Amiga E. As there's no
installation script available, you will have to do this job yourself:

1) Extract the 'amigae21b.lha' archive to your harddisk.
2) Extract the 'amigaedocs.lha' archive to the Amiga E directory.

3) Make an (permanent) assign 'EC:' to the Amiga E 'Bin' directory.
4) Make an (permanent) assign 'EMODULES:' to the 'Modules' directory.
5) Make an (permanent) assign 'ETEXTS:' to the 'ModulesText' directory.
6) Optionally, for your own convenience, make an 'E:' assignment to your
   E sources directory.

At last, run the ESEE Installer script, which will install the needed
configuration and reference index files for GoldED.
@endnode
@node future "ESEE Future"

                               @{b}ESEE Future@{ub}

ESEE is my idea of an ideal E Developing Environment. Although it is still
in its initial state, the version is already 1.0, because it has full
functionality and no bugs are known.

Personally, I think the future of ESEE is good. With the announcement of
a coming Amiga E 2.5, I think ESEE can grow into a perfect environment to
edit, update, maintain and compile your E sources and modules. Also,
GoldED can function as a compiler platform from which you call all tools
needed to compile, test and run E programs.

I will try to update the ESEE with the coming of new E or GoldED versions,
as well as the coming of new tools. By the way, the reason that no support
is given yet to tools like EPP or EDS is the coming of Amiga E 2.5, where
many tools will be unnecessary or have to be changed (for the better).

Of course, there is no such thing as a PERFECT environment, as each user
wants its own features. However, ESEE can serve as a base environment
which you can adapt and configure to your own needs.

Also, any ideas or bugreports concerning ESEE are welcome. See
@{" About the Author " link author} for more info.
@endnode
@node distribution "ESEE Distribution"

                         @{b}ESEE Distribution@{ub}

ESEE is freely distributable and will always stay that way. Note that
this only applies to the configuration and support of which ESEE exists,
and @{b}NOT@{ub} to the programs 'GoldED' and 'AmigaE', which are in no way
connected to ESEE concerning copyrights and/or distributability.

Only the complete ESEE archive may be copied or uploaded. Once you have
obtained ESEE you may, of course, alter it fully to your own needs. But
altered or single files may not be spread under the name 'ESEE'.

Thanks for living up to these rules!
@endnode
@node author "About the Author"

                          @{b}About the Author@{ub}

I'm a novice in the E programming language, and also in using GoldED, but
I have put much time in learning the powerful features of both.

I decided to learn E after I saw the complexity (read 'chaos' :o) of C
sources. Now, I think E is far better than C, and I don't regret the
choice I made!

The author of Amiga E is Wouter van Oortmerssen.

I fell in love with GoldED after I discovered its flexibility. I already
liked GFA-BASIC's editor, which supported folding, but GoldED blows away
any competitor, even CygnusEditor 3.5!

The author of GoldED is Dietmar Eilert.

I configured GoldED completely from a clean start for Amiga E and then
decided to release this configuration with its ARexx and Assembler tools
as ESEE, an addition to GoldED and Amiga E.

I am the author of the E Source Editor Environment (ESEE). If you have any
remarks, ideas or bugreports concerning ESEE contact me:

user can select a previous used pattern and the cursorred word (The word
the cursor is over). If the pattern is found in the text, the editor will
jump to that location.
@endnode
@node M2.1 "Find/Find Next"

                              @{b}Find/Find Next@{ub}

@endnode
@node M2.10 "Find/Check Brackets"

                           @{b}Find/Check Brackets@{ub}

Checks the cursorred line (The line the cursor is over) for a correct
balance of opening brackets '(' and closing brackets ')'. If one of these
occurences more than the other, a requester will tell the user, that the
bracket check failed. Also see @{" Find/Matching Bracket " link M2.11}.

This feature comes in handy because AmigaE may need a lot of brackets, as
it doesn't have any precedence.
@endnode
@node M2.11 "Find/Matching Bracket"

                          @{b}Find/Matching Bracket@{ub}

Searches for the bracket belonging to the cursorred bracket (The bracket
the cursor is over). Also see @{" Find/Check Brackets " link M2.10}.
@endnode

@node M2.7.0 "Find/Cursor Marked/Section..."

                      @{b}Find/Cursor Marked/Section...@{ub}

This will do the same as @{" Find/Selectable/Section... " link M2.8.0} but will now use the
cursorred word (The word the cursoris over) as the selected section. The
parse mode selected in the section window (@{" Find/Selectable/Section... " link M2.8.0}) will
be used to find the section.

For example, you're editing an E source and the 'PROC' parser is
selected. You now want to use a procedure defined elsewhere in your
source, but you forgot the parameters it needs. Just place the cursor
over the procedurename and select this menuitem. The editor will jump
to the place where the procedure is defined (PROC).

For another example, the 'OBJECT' parser is selected and you're reading
a referenced file (also see @{" Find/Cursor Marked/Reference... " link M2.7.1}), let's say
'graphic/displayinfo' where you found out what the object 'nameinfo'
looks like. But now, you want to know what the substructure 'qh' is.
Just place the cursor over 'qh' and choose this item. The editor will
jump to the object definition of 'qh'.
@endnode
@node M2.7.1 "Find/Cursor Marked/Reference..."

                     @{b}Find/Cursor Marked/Reference...@{ub}

This will do the same as @{" Find/Selectable/Reference... " link M2.8.1} but will now use
the cursorred word (The word the cursor is over) as the reference to
search for.

Also, this item is quite similar to the @{" Find/Cursor Marked/Section... "link M2.8.0}
option, with an additional advantage. Instead of just searching the
current file for this section, this option can search a whole bunch of
files or directories. These files are called reference files and can
be selected via @{" Configuration/References " link M6.7}. After the editor has found
the right section in one of the files, it will open the file and jump to
it.

For example, you want to read the AutoDoc of a system function. Place the
cursor over the functionname and select this item. A new window will open
where the AutoDoc appears. The editor jumps to the right description.
@endnode
@node M2.7.2 "Find/Cursor Marked/File..."

                        @{b}Find/Cursor Marked/File...@{ub}

This will try to open the cursorred file. This means that the word where
the cursor is over is used as a filename that will be opened on a new
window. The directories and the 'try' suffixes can be selected via
@{" Configuration/File Hunter... " link M6.8}.

For example, you're editing an Amiga E source and want to know what flags
there exist for a gadget. You place the cursor over 'intuition/intuition'
of 'MODULE 'intuition/intuition'' and select this item. A new window will
appear with the file 'intuition/intuition.txt' of the module texts.

@endnode
@node M2.8.0 "Find/Selectable/Section..."

                        @{b}Find/Selectable/Section...@{ub}

This will open a window with a list of so called 'sections'. These
sections can be functions, objects, (assembler) labels etc. In fact, they
can be anything, as GoldED offers the ability to use custom section
parsers.

I have implemented two parsers for Amiga E. One is a procedure parser,
called PROC, the other an object parser, called OBJECT.

You can choose the parse mode with the 'mode' button. After doing that,
the current file will be parsed with the according parser, and a list of
sections will be shown. Clicking on a section will have the editor jump
to that section, leaving the section window opened. Double-clicking,
however, will close the section window.
@endnode
@node M2.8.1 "Find/Selectable/Reference..."

                       @{b}Find/Selectable/Reference...@{ub}

This is quite similar to the @{" Find/Selectable/Section... " link M2.8.0} option, with an
additional advantage. Instead of just searching the current file for this
section, this option can search a whole bunch of files or directories.
These files are called reference files and can be selected via
@{" Configuration/References " link M6.7}. After the editor has found the right section
in one of the files, it will open the file and jump to the
according section.
@endnode
@node M3.0 "Control/(Un)Fold all"

                           @{b}Control/(Un)Fold all@{ub}

This item will unfold (open) or fold (close) all folders in your current
file. If the cursor is over an opened folder, all folders will be closed,
and vice versa. The key shortcut is 'Control-Help'.

See @{" Configuration/Misc " link M6.14} for an explanation of folders,
how to set the folder begin and end markers, the use of nested folders and
the AutoFold feature.
@endnode
@node M3.1 "Control/Make Proc Folders"

                        @{b}Control/Make Proc Folders@{ub}

This item will run an ARexx script that will encapsulate each Amiga E
procedure definition (PROC) inbetween the current folder markers (See
@{" Configuration/Misc " link M6.14} for how to set these markers).

After this, you are able to unfold (open) and fold (close) such a
procedure folder with the 'Help' key.
@endnode
@node M3.3 "Control/Toggle Word Wrap"

                         @{b}Control/Toggle Word Wrap@{ub}

This item will toggle the Word Wrap feature. Word wrapping means that the
editor will jump to a new line after you typed past the right margin,
which can be set via @{" Configuration/Layout... " link M6.3}.

Never use Word Wrap when editing a (Amiga E) source file, as this will
destroy your source code layout.
@endnode
@node M3.4 "Control/Toggle Insert Mode"

                        @{b}Control/Toggle Insert Mode@{ub}

This item will toggle between Insert Mode and Overwrite Mode. Insert Mode
menas that typed text will be inserted before the current cursor
postition. Overwrite Mode will overwrite the text below the cursor with
the typed text.
@endnode
@node M3.6 "Control/Next Window"

                           @{b}Control/Next Window@{ub}

The editor will activate the next window, so that this will become your
current edit file. Pressing 'Right Amiga-/' will do the same.

This makes it easy to flip through source code, modules, and (other)
reference files very easily.
@endnode
@node M3.7 "Control/Layout Windows"

                          @{b}Control/Layout Windows@{ub}

All opened windows will be divided over the visual space, one below the
other. The keyboard shortcut is 'Right Amiga-.' (which is also the
Workbench 3.x shortcut for Clean Up :o)

This is handy if you want to oversee several files at once.
@endnode
@node M3.8 "Control/Maximize Windows"

                         @{b}Control/Maximize Window@{ub}

@endnode
@node M6.4 "Configuration/Indention..."

                        @{b}Configuration/Indention...@{ub}

Here you can define indent and outdent keywords that can be used in
conjuction with the AutoIdention feature. AutoIndention means that when
the user has enterred a line, the editor will check the line for possible
in and outdenters, and will automatically indent the cursor on the next
line.

SmartIndention means that the editor will place the cursor on the same
column as where the previous line started.

For Amiga E source editing, it is suggested that both options are on,
so that a neat source code can be typed without problems.

For example, when typing 'WHILE bla bla...' and pressing return, the
editor will automatically indent one tab size.

Read the AmigaGuide that came with GoldED to know more about GoldED's
nice indention features.
@endnode
@node M6.5 "Configuration/Dictionary..."

                       @{b}Configuration/Dictionary...@{ub}

Here you can define the correct casing of keywords, so that the editor
can correct wrong cased keywords when the user presses return at the end
of a line. This option is enabled by checkmarking the AutoCase gadget.

Also, the dictionary can be used to complete the cursorred word (The word
the cursor is over). The first letter of the cursorred word has to match
the first one of the correct dictionary entry. The editor will try to
complete the word.

An additional Auto Brackets Check is available (Also see
@{" Find/Check Brackets " link M2.10}).

(most of) Amiga E's keywords are already there in this configuration, so
that the necessary keywords are uppercased automatically.

For example, when typing 'if bla bla then ...' and pressing return, the
editor will automatically change the line to 'IF bla bla THEN ...'.

@endnode
@node M6.7 "Configuration/References..."

                       @{b}Configuration/References...@{ub}

Referencing is a feature that let's you open a help text that refers to
the word the cursor is over (See @{" Find/Cursor Marked/Reference " link M2.7.1}), or any
selectable word (See @{" Find/Selectable/Reference " link M2.8.1}).

To set up the reference system, you first have to create a reference
index file, which can be done by selecting a filename for the index file,
and then pressing 'create'.

Now you can select the reference files. After selection of the files
and/or directories, press 'OK'. The editor will now scan the files for
occurences of sections which are parsed through both built-in and custom
section parsers (See @{" Find/Selectable/Section... " link M2.8.0}).

After parsing, the index file contains keyword-reference file pairs.
These can then be used to open the reference file to a certain keyword.

For example, AutoDocs can be selected as reference files, after which the
editor scans the AutoDocs for function documentation and makes an index
of these. When you need the AutoDoc of a certain function, just place the
cursor over the function and select @{" Find/Cursor Marked/Reference... " link M2.7.0}
and the AutoDoc will be opened, and the correct funtion documention
will be shown.
@endnode
@node M6.8 "Configuration/File Hunter..."

                       @{b}Configuration/File Hunter...@{ub}

The file hunter makes it possible to open include files by just placing
the cursor over the filename and selecting @{" Find/Cursor Marked/File... " link M2.7.2}.
GoldED will now try to open that include file.

Although many include files have extensions, these often have not to be
typed within the source code. For example, Amiga E uses '*.m' extension
for modules, but when using a module with 'MODULE 'xx/xx', the '*.m'
extension must not be typed.

Therefore, you have to set up 'try suffixes' for include directories.
This must be done in the File Hunter window. For example, if you want
to be able to hunt for Amiga E module texts, just select the 'ModuleText'
directory and set the 'try suffix' to '*.txt'. Now place the cursor over
the 'xx/xx' of 'MODULE xx/xx' and select @{" Find/Cursor Marked/File... " link M2.7.2}.
@endnode
@node M6.10 "Configuration/Display..."

                          @{b}Configuration/Misc...@{ub}

@{b}AutoLoad@{ub}

This option enabled will command GoldED to open the last closed project
upon start.

@{b}AutoFold@{ub}

This option enabled will command GoldED to fold (close) all folders upon
loading.

Folding is a feature that makes it easy for you to oversee your (large)
source code more clearly. You can place so-called 'folder markers' in
your source code, commented out for the compiler/interpreter, that
indicate the beginning and end of a folder. Each folder can then be
opened and closed by a simple key shortcut, the 'Help' key.

@{b}Center window@{ub}

This option enabled will command GoldED to center all opened windows upon
loading.

@{b}Fast Scrolling@{ub}

If enabled, GoldED will speed up scrolling after the cursor if past the
first or last line of the window.

@{b}Stay in RAM@{ub}

If enabled, and you closed the last window, GoldED will stay in memory
waiting to be re-activated by the HotKey 'Shift-Right Alt-Return' or by
the quickstarter.

@{b}Default bitflags@{ub}

Here you can set the default flags for a new file (See @{" Project/New " link M0.1}) or
after you cleared a window (See @{" Project/Clear " link M0.0}).

@{b}Folder Markers@{ub}

Here you can enter the folder markers, used by the editor to determine
the beginning and end of folders. If both begin and end markers are the
same, folding is faster than when they are different. Also, the shorter
the markers, the faster the folding. Maximum size is 8 characters.

It is also possible to use nested folders (new folders may exist
inbetween a begin and end marker), but this requires the begin and end
markers to be different.
