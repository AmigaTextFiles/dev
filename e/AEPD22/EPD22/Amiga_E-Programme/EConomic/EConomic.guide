 @{i}Installation @{ui}

 1. As EConomic communicates with your editor through Arexx, you must
    have Arexx installed and activated.

 2. If you haven't installed the @{"Bgui.library" LINK Bgui.library/Bgui.doc/main} yet, you must do so first.
    This library can be found in the Bgui.library drawer.

 3. Copy EConomic to the directory you desire, the obvious place to
    put it is in your E binaries directory.

 4. If you have the Reqtools installed (not included with this release)
    EComomic will use the Reqtools filerequester instead of the default
    Asl.library file requester.


 @{i}Running EConomic for the first time @{ui}

 1. Run your editor.

 2. Run EConomic.

 3. If your editor is running on its own public screen, select
    'Next public screen' from the EConomic 'Preferences' menu until
    the EConomic main window appears on this public screen.

 4. IF your E binaries are not located in 'E:bin' then you must tell
    EConomic where they are. Do this by selecting 'Locate E binaries...'
    in the 'Preferences' menu.

 5. Next select 'Arexx...' from the EConomic 'Preferences' menu and 
    configure the Arexx host and Arexx command entries to your editor. See
    the @{"Arexx preferences window" LINK " Arexx preferences window "} for more information on how to do this. 
    CED or GOLDED users can simply go to the 'Project' menu of the arexx
    preferences window an select their preset, either 'CED'or 'GOLDED'.

 6. If you are using ECDEMO you should select 'EC...' from the EConomic
    'Preferences' menu, change 'EC' in the compiler section to 'ECDEMO'
    and seriously consider registration of Amiga E.

 Now save your preferences, by selecting 'Save preferences', subitem 
 'Default' from the 'Preferences' menu.

 NOTE: To quickly reach EConomic from within the editor you might want 
       to assign an editor's macro or hotkey to launch it, refer to your
       editors manual on how to do this.

 'About'                 Pops up 'About' requester.

 'Compile'               Compiles the source in the active editor window.
                         'EC' or 'ECDEMO' must be present in your E binaries
                         directory.

 'Run'                   Runs a succesfully compiled program.

 'Open project'          Loads file, previously set with 'Set project'
                         into the editor.

 'Set project'           Save current filepath as env variable, see above

 'NewShell'              CD's to the current source directory and pops up

                         is running on.

 'ShowModule...'         Pops up a filerequester from where you can select
                         a module to execute 'ShowModule' with. The output
                         will be directed to a newly opened editor file.

 'Next public screen...'     Pops EConomic to the next public screen.

 'Use local preferences'     When set, when compiling, look for local 
                             preferences and use them if they exist.
                             The local preferences filename should be 
                             '<name>.eco' (where <name> is the sourcename
                             without the '.e' extention) in order for this
                             to work.

 'EC output'                 When set, EConomic directs the compiler output
                             to a CON: window on the public screen EConomic
                             is running on, else directs the ouput to 'NIL:'

 'Save before compilation'   When set, EConomic saves the source before
                             compilation.

 'Icon creation'             When set, EConomic creates a default tool icon
                             for the compiled program.

 'Beep on error'             When set, EConomic beeps on errors.

 'Center mouse'              When set, the requesters and preferences windows
                             will open under the current mouse position.

 'Buffered rp'               When set, the BGui.library engine uses a 
                             buffered raster-port while rendering.

 'Make pubscreen default'    When set, the public screen EConomic is running
                             on will be the default public screen.

 'Load preferences'          Sub-item 'Default'.
                             Loads the default preferences.

 'Load preferences'          Sub-item 'Local'.
                             Will pop up a filerequester from where you can
                             select a local preferences file to load.

 'Save preferences'          Sub-item 'Default'.
                             Saves current preferences as default.

 'Save preferences'          Sub-item 'Local'.
                             Pops up a filerequester from where local 
                             preferences can be saved. The local preferences
                             filename should be '<name>.eco' (where <name>
                             is the sourcename without the '.e' extention)
                             in order to use a local preferences file with
                             the 'Use local preferences' option.
                             Local preferences files contain EConomic's
                             'EC' and 'Run' preferences, while the default
                             preferences file contains all of EConomic's
                             preferences.

 EConomic's Arexx commands are probably not very usefull in
 Arexx scripts, but they can be used to make any of the EConomic
 menu-choices available from within the editor without having to
 activate EConomic's window. You can 'map' an EConomic menu-choice,
 through Arexx, to a key or key-combination of your editor.



 Example for CED, map EConomic's menu-choice 'Compile' to key F2:

      Go to the 'Special' menu, select menu-item 'DOS/Arexx interface'
      and select submenu-item 'Install DOS/Arexx command...'. Next enter
      '2' in the command number requester and finaly in the command
      requester enter (including quotes): 'address "EConomic.1" compile'

 This program was programmed in E v3.1a

 I programmed the skeleton of this utility about two years ago, for
 personal use, to help me get along with my e-programming for wich I 
 use CygnusEd as an editor.

 As a project of learning how to program in E while using the Bgui.library
 i turned it into a much more complete program, and finaly, when i had
