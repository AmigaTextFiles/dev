@node main "Exec - Introduction"
In the exec.library we find the basics of the OS, such as memory handling,
tasks, signals, message ports and much more. It's in many ways extraordinary:
it's the only library open from the start, it's base's address lies at
address #4, ...

This document will tell you something of exec in general, for more detailed
information chose one of the following:

        Communication

sorry, there ain't no more written right now :)

Well, how should I start... hm, maybe with this great feature named
multi-tasking. It means nothing else than that a number programs can be run
virtually simultaneously. I could type the university-like definition of
multi-tasking but basically it says the same.

The running programs can communicate with each other via the message system.
A 'port' can be created where messages can arrive, the program that created
this port can tell the other programs: 'Send the messages that I shall read
to this port, I will read and answer if necessary.'

In a multi-tasking environment each program has to tell what part of the
memory available it wants to use - imagine the chaos if the memory you put
your data in was accessed by a painting program that thinks this is the place
to put its drawings in ;-)

Almost everything in the OS is put in a list - tasks, message ports,
allocated memory etc. One feature of a list is it's dynamic, another that it's
easy to rearrange its order.
