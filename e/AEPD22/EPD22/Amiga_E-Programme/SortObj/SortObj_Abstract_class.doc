Fellow Amiga E'ers:

Here's another Amiga E OT example, although this one may be
useful to some folks out there.

This archive includes an abstract class called 'sortobj'
which can be used to help build objects that one might need
to make comparisons between instances.

That is, if you need to sort instances of your object,
derive your object from sortobj and supply your own cmp()
function.

In the future, I will likely try to create a sorted list
object that will use this sortobj module.

In the meantime, I thought this might be useful to some
folks out there.

Included is a string and integer object (although I will be
changing both of these to make them more functional in the
future).

As ever, Wouter is free to include these in any future
releases of Amiga E if he desires.  They are Public Domain..
I just ask that I be given credit for my own work.

- Trey
