What is FCD? 
------------
FCD is a synonym for FastChangeDirectory and it may make life easier if you have
a harddisk with hundreds of dir, subdirs, subsubdirs, subsubsub... And here is
the point where FCD comes in. FCD makes changing to a special dir much easier
than the original CD does. 
Lets have an example. 
With CD you write:  cd creative/graphics/dpaint/pictures/ham8
but with FCD:       fcd ham8
FCD was written for harddisk owners but it will work with floppies too.


Overview of the features
------------------------
- simple and easy changing to any dir by giving a simple name or
  any search pattern following AmigaDOS conventions
- changing to the n-th dir matching to the current one
- special mode: give a number and fcd changes to the number-th dir in the tree
- overview of all dirs witch contain the brainfile


How to use FCD?
---------------
A note to all users with Kick1.2/1.3: this program needs at least Kick2.04. So
if you don't have - upgrade! 

If you use FCD the first time you need to create a brainfile.
For that you write: fcd create <volumename>
              f.e.: fcd create dh1:

FCD creates now a file named: 'fcd.file' on dh1 and you can use fcd on this
partition now. But have care that you are on the right partition where FCD can
find its brainfile otherwhise an error will come up.
FCD has been splitted into two several programs. They are nearly the same but
with a little difference in using. FCDQUICK has the limitation that you can only
write: fcd <dir> and not fcd <dir/dir/dir>. And secondly FCDQUICK supports as
wildcards only * at the end
                            f.e.: fcd dos*.
                         or only: fcd dos
For my purposes this was always enough but as result of this restriction
FCDQUICK is quite fast. The other one FCDFULL provides full patternmatching
following the AmigaDOS conventions. With it it's no problem to write: 
                            f.e.:fcd #?/(#?entweder#?|#?oder#?)/oderdochhier
but FCDFULL is much slower than the other one. All the other features (and
errormessages :-)) are the same.


The options
-----------
The first one *create* you already know by now. With *create* you may combine
the *show* option 
                 f.e.: fcd create dh1: show
FCD shows now the dirs it will find but this may slow down the creation of the
brainfile. If you use the *show* option together with a pattern (depends on
witch one of both you're using), FCD shows you the occurence of all dirs it
will find in the brainfile. So if you write 
                 f.e.: fcd show d*

FCD shows now all dirs witch will match to this pattern. The numbers shown in
the second column you can use if you write: 
                       fcd num <numerical value>.
                       
FCD changes now to the right directory. 

The first number in the *show* output you can write in addition to a normal fcd
call. Imagine on your Harddisk are lots of dirs matching to dos* but you want to
change to the fifth of these ones. You write: fcd dos* 5. FCD looks now in the
brainfile for the fifth directory matching to the given pattern. But if you are
already in a 'dos' subdir FCD changes to the fifth directory starting from the
current one. Don't writing such a number implys a one. With this feature you're
able to change to the n-th matching dir in the directory tree.


Overview of all options
-----------------------
?                        - shows all possible options
fcd <dir>                - changes to <dir>, pattern depends on the used program
fcd path <dir>           - does the same
fcd <dir> <num>          - goes to the <num>-th matching dir
fcd <dir> cycle <num>    - does the same
fcd create <volume>      - creates a new brainfile for <volume>
fcd create <volume> show - does the same but you can see the found dirs
fcd show <dir>           - shows all matching dirs in the brainfile
fcd num <num>            - changes to the right dir with the right number


What about the old brainfiles?
------------------------------
If you use an older version of FCD you don't need to create new brainfiles, they
are upwards compatible. (and the other way around too)


future improvements
-------------------
FCD in the actual version hasn't any time saving update option. In detail this
means that you have to create a complete new brainfile if you have changed
someting in the directory tree.


last note
---------
FCD was written using Amiga_EV2.1b provided by Wouter van Oortmerssen. Thanks for
that great compiler.
This package includes the source of FCDFULL.
