Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   When I started programming in Amiga E around
early 1996. I noticed there was no examples for an
absolute beginner. Ok, so there was documents and
guides but for an absolute beginner, that just can
not be enough!

  This is my attempt to plug the gap and help make
absolute beginners feel at home. At the moment the
archive is a bit thin, I hope to continuosly add
to the pack so that as many aspects of E are shown
in a simple to understand way as possible!
