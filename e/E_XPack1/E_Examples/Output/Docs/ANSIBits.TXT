ANSIBits.e By Edward Farrow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ANSI Codes are simple and can be used for anything from fancy output and
input styles to bulletin board system displays.
   ANSI Codes in Amiga E are very simple to do! All you have to do is use
the built in Amiga E keyword `\e'.

Code    Effect       Notes
~~~~    ~~~~~~       ~~~~~
  0m  = Normal     - Always finish your line with this as it makes sure your
                     code doesnt go haywire. Also use it to switch off
                     atributes.
  1m  = Bold
  2m  = White
  3m  = Italic     - Useful for things like quotes and usage information.
  4m  = Underlined
  7m  = Reversed   - Reverse text can be used for all sorts of things but is
                     best used sparingly! Too much can annoy users.

*  Anything higher than 7m tends to be system dependant (although 33m is  *
*  blue text) So it is best not to use them...                            *


*NOTE* ANSI Codes for BBS' will be different! BBS' have the ability to
display a whole host of colours and codes while being 100% compatible with
all computers. If you want to learn ANSI codes for BBS' get a document such
as ANSI Guide by Spiny Norman.
