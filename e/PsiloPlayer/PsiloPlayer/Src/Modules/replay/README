A bit of info on the 'replayer.m' module. It contains some pretty
useful routines for writing music replayers. They go a little bit
like this:

  dti_AudioAlloc() - attempts to allocate the audio channels for
                     exclusive use, returns bool as success.

  dti_AudioFree()  - frees the audio channels if they were allocated
                     by dti_AudioFree(), does nothing otherwise. Safe
                     to call in any case.

  dti_StartInt(c)  - where c is a pointer to an interrupt routine.
                     This function sets up a soft-interrupt triggered
                     by a CIA timer interrupt (the net result being
                     that you get a timer interrupt that doesn't
                     block serial transfer and such) for the
                     specified code. Returns bool as success.

  dti_StopInt()    - stops and deallocates the interrupts installed
                     by dti_StartInt(), does nothing otherwise.

  dti_SetSpeed(s)  - sets the speed of the timer interrupt installed
                     by dti_StartInt() to the specified number of
                     beats per minute. The interrupt must be running
                     for this to work!
