<P>
For v3.1 it was updated by Jason Hulance, to fix the bug that executed 
actions in reverse order. Also he introduced the local variable 
$target in actions. 

</P>
<P>
EBuild was updated for v3.3a by Gregor Goldbach to support symbolic 
constants and to stop on cyclic dependancies. The $target behaviour 
was expanded to match other symbols: $(target) is legal, too.
