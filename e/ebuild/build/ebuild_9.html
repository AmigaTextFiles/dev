<P>
Once you get to know build, you'll discover you can use it for 
more purposes than just this. See it as an intelligent script tool.

<P>
If you want to find out the details of what build can do, read the 
documentation of some unix-make, as build should be somewhat compatible 
with this. What it doesn't do for now, is: 

</P>

<UL>
<LI>allow backslash at the end of a line for longer rules

<P>
When EBuild discovers a cyclic dependancy it just aborts, i.e. this 
won't be executed: 

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
bla:	defs.m blurp.m bla 
	ec $(target).e 
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
since the target <CODE>bla.e</CODE> has the dependancy <CODE>bla.e</CODE>. EBuild
used to crash with an infinite loop on this one. However, it is still
very easy to make an infinite loop:

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
bla:	defs.m blurp.m bla 
	ec $(target).e 

defs.m: bla
        ec defs.e
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<TT>`bla'</TT> depends on <TT>`defs.m'</TT> which depends on <TT>`bla'</TT> which
depends on <TT>`defs.m'</TT> which depends on <TT>`bla'</TT> which depends on
<TT>`defs.m'</TT> which depends on <TT>`bla'</TT> which depends on <TT>`defs.m'</TT>
