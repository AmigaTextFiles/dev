<P>
EBuild is a <CODE>Make</CODE> clone, and it functions likewise. It is a tool 
that helps you in recompiling necessary parts of a large application 
after modification. 

</P>
<P>
You write a file <CODE>.build</CODE> in the directory 
that contains the sources of your project. The file contains info 
about which sources depend on which, and what actions need to be 
performed if a module or exe needs to be rebuilt. 

</P>
<P>
EBuild checks the dates of the files to see if a source has been
modified after the last compilation, and if the source uses modules that
also have been modified, it will compile these first.
