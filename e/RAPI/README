Legal-

   I realease RAPI to the public domain for educational use.  I really
cant think of any way that someone is going to make money off of it but
please dont without my written concent.  It is alright to distribute this at
will as long as no fee is charged except for Media and Disk Copy costs.  And
you must also distribute the entire package which includes:

RAPI                              (The executable)
RAPI.e                            (The source code in E)
RAPI.info                         (This is optional.  I dont think anyone
                                  who cant use a CLI would have any use for
                                  this example or program)

What the **** is RAPI?-

   RAPI is a program that uses E's random number generator Rnd() function
to generate random numbers to use as a demonstration of how the random
number algorithms (or Psedocode random numbers) are actually not very random.
It helpes give a good Illustration of how your computer generates random
numbers using an algorithm.  This also shows why an encryption program that
uses Pseudocode random numbers is not a very good one.  Anyway it is meant
more as a source example of E than anything else.  You can play with it by
adjusting the color range, and size of window. You could also change OpenW()
to OpenS() but please dont distibute your changed source under this name. I
hate it when things get mixed up.  Anyways have fun.
