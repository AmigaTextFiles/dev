				    ABOUT
				    ¯¯¯¯¯

MemBar is a small utility that displays you free memory using to bar, one
for CHIP mem, one for FAST mem. I've been using DClock for quite a long
time, but I only used the memory display of DClock. Because DClock needs
quite a lot of memory, I wrote MemBar, which is much smaller.

MemBar was compiled under DICE V2.06.40 © by Matthew Dillon.

				INSTRUCTIONS
				¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well, there isn't much to explain. The top bar indicates how much of your
CHIP mem is allocated, the bottom bar is for FAST mem.

Pressing the right mousebutton on the activated MemBar window, switches the
display to the actual date and time. Another click swaps to the bars again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

				INSTALLATION
				¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It is adviseable to start MemBar using your startup-sequence. Copy the two
files MemBar and RunBackGround to your C: directory and insert the line :

	RunBackGround C:MemBar

to your startup-sequence. You should use RunBackGround, because otherwise
the CLI-window won't be closed after EndCLI.
