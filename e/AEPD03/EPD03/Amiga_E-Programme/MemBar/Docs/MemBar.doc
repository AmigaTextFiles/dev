MemBar V2.1           © 1992 by PARADISE SOFT     PUBLIC DOMAIN

      This revision accomplished by Barry Wills, released 12 Jun 93.

NOTE:  following this update text is the original documentation of MemBar
V1.0.

I rewrote MemBar in the E language as a programming excercise.  Amiga E
V2.1b and EPP V0.13b are required to compile the E source (Amiga E is
Copyright ©Wouter van Oortmerssen, EPP is Copyright ©Barry Wills.)

I did make some changes to the way MemBar operates, the foremost of which is
that I neglected to place the date in the title bar.  I also wanted the
seconds to update naturally, I didn't want the display to be ghosted when
the window becomes inactive, and I threw in an occasional WindowToFront() so
the window won't remain hidden if covered.

There are two flavors of MemBar V2.1:  LARGE, if you like the look of the
original meter, and SMALL, if like me you prefer to use as little of the
display as possible.  Small MemBar has no front/back gadgets, and the window
close gadget is hidden by the meter and clock displays.

The MemBar V2.1 executables are less than half the size of of V1.0, but
because I'm invoking some extra functions the required RAM increased from
20K to about 23K for small MemBar, and about 24K for large Membar.

MemBar V2.1 was compiled with AmigaE V2.1b and should be compatible with
KickStart 1.2 up.  I'd like to thank "Pink" of PARADISE SOFT for releasing
the C code for MemBar.  I found it very instructive.  Thanks again to Wouter
van Oortmerssen for his awesome Amiga E language!  No additional
restrictions are placed on MemBar V2.1.

                                    ABOUT
                                    ¯¯¯¯¯

MemBar is a small utility that displays you free memory using to bar, one
for CHIP mem, one for FAST mem. I've been using DClock for quite a long
time, but I only used the memory display of DClock. Because DClock needs
quite a lot of memory, I wrote MemBar, which is much smaller.

MemBar was compiled under DICE V2.06.40 © by Matthew Dillon.

                                INSTRUCTIONS
                                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Well, there isn't much to explain. The top bar indicates how much of your
CHIP mem is allocated, the bottom bar is for FAST mem.

Pressing the right mousebutton on the activated MemBar window, switches the
display to the actual date and time. Another click swaps to the bars again.

                                INSTALLATION
                                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

It is adviseable to start MemBar using your startup-sequence. Copy the two
files MemBar and RunBackGround to your C: directory and insert the line :

        RunBackGround C:MemBar

to your startup-sequence. You should use RunBackGround, because otherwise
the CLI-window won't be closed after EndCLI.
