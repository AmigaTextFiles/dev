Ez_E V1.1 by Kevin Connell

  This is a simple GUI interface to use with E.  I wrote it to make programming
in E a simpler task.  I had a hard time shuffling windows around, opening a shell
'CD'-ing to the right directory, and doing all that typing.

Ez_E makes E Ez!!!

  It's really just a simple cover that replaces all that window shuffling and
typing. There are 5 simple buttons (6 in the 2.0nly version) that should be self
explanatory, but the use of each is as follows:

Compile: This button will compile your program.  All output from the compiler
         will appear in the 'Ez_E IO window' so you can see what it is doing.
         Note that you should have selected a work file with editor before using
         this button, but if you didn't, it will ask you for an .e file to
         use as the object.

Editor:  This will open your editor.  It will present you a file requestor, and
         all you need to do is locate your current work file.  It will
         automatically pass the name of this file to your editor, so don't worry
         about passing command strings.

Execute: This will (attempt to) run the program you are currently working on. If
         you have not opened a project with the editor or the compiler button, it
         will do nothing at all.  Currently opens a full screen window to run your
         program in.

Config:  This allows you to set up your personal configuration.  It is saved in a
         file called Ez_E.Cfg in your S: directory.  The first time the program
         is run, it will set the defaults, and write the config file.  You should
         then use Config to set your own preferences.  There are only 3 prefs
         right now, and it will step through them one at a time, so it is very
         self explanatory.
    Defaults: Path to EC     = 'C:'       This is where Ez_E will look for EC to
                                          compile the programs.
              Path to Editor = 'C:'       This is where Ez_E will look for your
                                          editor.
              Name of Editor = 'MeMacs'   This is the name of the default editor.
              Work Directory = 'RAM:"     This is where Ez_E will look for your
                                          .e projects.

About:   Just a little requester with some info about me in it.

Exit:    Only available in the 2.0 version.  Use this to exit Ez_E.

And thats it!  Short, simple, and Ez to use.
