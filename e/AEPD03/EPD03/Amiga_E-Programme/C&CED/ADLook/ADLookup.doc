   WHAT IT IS
   ~~~~~~~~~~
ADLookup is an autodoc function lookup routine for Cygnus Ed.  It
brings the doc for the function under the cursor into a CED view.

   WHAT YOU NEED
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
autodoc files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Works on any files that have the same format as the C= autodocs.

assign
~~~~~~
autodocs: <dir that has the autodoc files>

   ie  > ls autodocs:
         amiga_lib.doc
         asl.doc
          ...

index file
~~~~~~~~~~
ADInd makes the index file.  It's not quick.  It takes several seconds
to start up.  You can check out the operation by not redirecting the
output.

Usage:  ADInd >autodocs:INDEX autodocs:

       'ADInd ?' will remind you of the usage

Cygnus Ed F-Key assignments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ADLookup.ced goes in REXX and assign a CED function key (or macro) to

   rexx:adlookup.
