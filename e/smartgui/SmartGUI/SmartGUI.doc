1.Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Everybody knows that manual creation of graphics user interface tires
very much. In spite of introducing better kickstart (gadtools.library)
its took huge amount of time. Jan van den Baard made gui generator
'GadToolsBox', but he didn't implement source generator for E.
Wouter did an interim version of converter and Martin Kuchinka patched
its, but it wasn't good for me. I needed more useful tool. Thus
an idea of GUI for converter came into being. This converter is especially
for users without hard disks. Now you can save time wasted on unneccerey
loading of source generator.
This program is  GIFTWARE which  means that  if you like  the program  you
should reward the author with gift that, you think, matches his efforts.


2.Features

6.Start
~~~~~~~
From Shell:
SmartGUI doesn't support Shell template. I removed this routine because
main goal of this produckt was controling without shell whole process
translation gui into e. But it is still possibility to start from shell.

From Workbench:
These tooltypes are supported:
WINLEFT=<value>  - distance between left borders of the screen and programm
                   window
WINTOP=<value>   - distance between top borders of the screen and programm
                   window
MAIN=<ON|OFF>    - allows user to remove PROC main() from generated code
ERROR=<ON|OFF>   - switch PROC raporterr() from source
WAIT4MES=<ON|OFF>- switch PROC wait4message() & rendergad()
LAYOUT=<ON|OFF>  - tells SmartGUI to create WindowTagList


7.Usage
~~~~~~~
Interface is very simple so I describe gadgets shortly.
There are five gadgets:
Load GUI & Convert to E - Allows user to select gui file and set name new
                          converted file.
Next four checkboxes are like tooltypes.
