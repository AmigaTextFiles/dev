@node overview "Go into the Overview"
Have you ever dreamed :
- to do (like PC's): 1> rename *.bak *.tmp (with your AmigaDos Rename) ?
- to execute commands on files you choose in just one command ?
- to select files whose size is beetween a range ?
- to view the type of the files you list ?
- to execute a particular command on particular files (ex: 1> showiff * type
ILBM) ?
- to give the ability to all your commands to handle wildcards and multiple
arguments ?
@endnode

@node whatis "What it is"
All is a Listing utility like AmigaDos List command (better than the last).
All is also a ForEach utility like unix for (better too).
All exists in two versions : freeware and shareware (just 5 boxes).
@endnode

@node synopsys "Synopsys"
All <files> [COM] [command string] [SIZEMIN] [number] [SIZEMAX] [number]
[DATEMIN] [datemin] [DATEMAX] [datemax] [TYPEPATTERN] [type of files] [DO]
[ALL] [TYPESFILE]
(see : 1> All ?)
@endnode

@node options "Options"
FILES/M - an infinite number of files and wildcards (when omitted, it's the
current directory)
  ex: #?.doc #?.?ak myfile this.#? th[a-z]t #?[a|b|c|%]d
COM=COMMAND/K - give the command string with the % parts you want to apply
on some files; works also as a switch : if you don't specify it you will
access to the list function else the execute function
  ex: com "rename %a %pfile%e"
SIZEMIN/N/K - give the minimum size the files must have
SIZEMAX/N/K - give the maximum size the files must have
DATEMIN/K - give the minimum date the files must be
DATEMAX/K - give the maximum date the files must be
TYPE=TYPEPATTERN/N/K - give the type pattern the files must be (very
usefull : with this you can choose the types of files)
  ex: type 8SVX|ILBM|ANIM, type XPK#?
DO/S - execute the command string (see COMMAND)
ALL/S - recursive mode on directories
TYPESFILE/K - the file of types for different display
@endnode

@node cmdoption "Command options"
It's the most important part. (It's like the List lcommand of AmigaDOS)

% parts:
- %a - the filename with path (ex: ram:env/sys/input.prefs)
- %f - only the filename (ex: input.prefs)
- %v - the volume (ex: ram)
- %p - only the path (ex: env/sys)
- %m - the main part (ex: input)
- %e - the extension part (ex: .prefs)
- %d - the date
- %t - the time
- %s - the size
- %b - the number of blocks
- %c - the comment
- %r - the protection
- %y - the type of the file
- %k - the key
- %% - the "%" character
@endnode

@node usage "Usage"
Examples of usage :

@node types "U have all these types !"
All works with a preferences file where to place the type recognition. I
made this because I would give the possibility to add your own types or the
new types you'll discover. You do this with the AllAddType command but just
the registered users have it. So register if you want to have all options.

At the moment you have the following types :

- XPK MASH
- XPK RAKE
- XPK RDCN
- XPK RLEN
- XPK SMPL
- XPK SQSH
- XPK CYB2
- XPK NUKE
- XPK SHRI
- XPK DLTA
- XPK DUKE
- XPK ENCO
- XPK FAST
- XPK FEAL
- XPK IDEA
- XPK Data (the others)
- GIF
- PowerPacked DATA
- AMOS program
- AMOS bank
- AMOS sprite
- AmigaOS Executable
- AmigaOS info file
- AmigaOS font file
- AmigaOS compugraphic font file
- AmigaOS postscript font file
- AmigaOS .metric file
- AmigaOS 1.2 .info file
- epu
- ProTracker-SoundTracker
- Octamed0
- Octamed1
- Bootblock.brainfile
- PC Executable
- Amigaguide
- 8SVX (sampled sound)
- ILBM (picture format)
- PREF
- ANIM
- ARC file
- MPEG
- Unix GZIP
- Pagestream document
- PCX (picture format)
- PKZIP
- Sonix song
- Prowrite document
- Imagine object
- Imagine picture
- GPFax file
- Flow outline
- FinalCopy document
- Cando variable
- Cando deck
- FORM (the others)
- LHA LH0
- LHA LH4
- LHA LH5
- LZ
- Maxiplan document
- Page Setter document
- E modules

But you can have more (the unregistered user) : if you mail me 3 files by
type I will add it in the prefs file on a new version for free !
@endnode

@node ctrlc "CTRL-C break handling"
You can stop All by pressing CTRL-C. If the command in the command string
(see COMMAND option) accept a CTRL-C to break, you break this first. Another
CTRL-C will break All. So be prepared to press several times the CTRL-C to
stop the whole.
@endnode

@node speed "All and AddBuffers"
You can speed up the listing by using :
1> Addbuffers df0: 50 (for example)
You can have a lot more speed if you don't use type recognition.
Try:
1> All DF0: ALL COM "%a"
@endnode

@node registered "What you have on the registered version"
- the registered version is much faster
- you have AllAddType command : to add new types on the prefs file
- you have the TYPEPATTERN option working
- you have all % parts working
@endnode

@node legal "Legal stuff"
You're a lucky guy. All is now registered free for everybody and is fully
enabled for your convenience.
It's my small contribution for the Amiga comunity.
Do Whatever u want with this.

it. So here it is for your convenience. Hope you will use it.
