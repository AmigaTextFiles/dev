 At first You have to choose the Button >COMPILE< ( the one with the 2
   Letters >EC< on it! ), and now you are in the COMPIILER-Menu...
 Here You can choose the CompilerOptions, have a look into the E-Docs
   for more explainations.

 Normally You don`t have to change any Option, because the best is
   already done... If You now choose the COMPILIEREN-Button Your
   Source will be compiled ( if it has no bug... )
 But if You would like to use the Compiler, You must choose the DEBUG
   Option at the COMPILE-Menu...
 NOTE: You are not be able to Debug Programms with more than 1 Task
   in it!!!!!! This is not a bug from EDBG!!! All debuggers have
   this "Bug"...

 At the last Line from the COMPILER-Menu you will find 2 more Buttons...
   One with the Word >FLUSHCACHE< on it ( this one will clean the 
   Module-Cache from the Compiler ) and the Button SHOWCACHE, with
   which you can show into the Modulechache...

 1. The Installation is relativ simpely... you only have to double-

        the Installer is given to you.

                >EXTERNEN EDITOR BENUTZEN<                
        - Now you have to complete the Name from your Editor in the
                String-Gadget at the right from the Check-Mark...
                ( E-DEV was testet with the following Editors:
                - Standart WB-Editor
                - GoldEd 3.x
                - CygnusED 3.5
                - FrexxEd & MegaED
        - And now you could type in the Name of your favorite
                Textviewer at the right from the Check-Mark which
                is labled ( and which should Checked! ) >EXTERNER
                TEXTVIEWER<.
        - At the Lable >Pfad/Name des Guicreators< you have to give
                the name of your favorite Gui-Creator ( Tested:
                        GadToolsBox 2.0b
                        MUI-Builder
        - The lable ARGS iss FREE!

    Now, The Main-Preferences are done, but if you are need the Online-
        Help (the big Onlinehelp) you have to check the CHECK-Mark 
        which is labled >AUSFÜHRLICHE HILFE<

    There are 2 buttons (ZEICHENSATZ EINSTELLEN, FARBEN ÄNDERN) which
        are not 100% done in this Version...

        zzzzz is the CoProcessor ( 0= No CoProcessor available!,
                68881, 68882, 68851 and 68040 for the 68040-CoCPU )
