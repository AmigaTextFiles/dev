      Introduction:
-------------------


      What is 'ViewModule' ? Well, if you're an Amiga_e programmer, you should
know what 'Showmodule' is ...

      'ViewModule' is a sort of 'Showmodule' utility, but with some nice
features. In fact, my program NEEDS and runs the 'Showmodule' so that it can 
make all the hard work of converting the module files to some more intelligible
stuff for we humans.

      So, here is what it does:



    · A Reqtools.library file requester pops up on the screen begging for
      a .m file to be selected

    · The module itself is viewed using the popular PPMore (By Nico François)

    · As a bonus, a file called 'module.DUMP' is created in RAM: containing
      an ASCII version of the selected module



      Requirements:
-------------------

    · The Amiga_E programming language (well, ViewModule should be only useful
      to Amiga_E programmers, I think  ...)

    · The 'PPMore' (any version)

    · The Amiga_E's 'ShowModule' utility (tested up to version 1.10)

    · Reqtools.library (version 37 or higher)
 
    · And an Amiga computer 8-)


   ViewModule SHOULD be compatible with all the OS versions and systems,
although ROM 2.xx or higher and an Hard Disk is always recommended, of course.



      Distribution:
-------------------

      'Viewmodule' is FREEWARE, so it may be freely distributable. You may
also use part of the source for your programs. However, you may NOT modify the
source and spread it (if you modify it, please keep it to yourself).

Although 'Viewmodule' is FREEWARE and not SHAREWARE, I really would not be
offended if you send me any donation (you know -> money !!!)

Sending me a post-card from your country could also be a nice alternative !
