This is the Amiga E v3.2a distribution archive.  You may want to get the E
v3.2a extras archive as well (optional).  Read docs/e.guide for details.  Read
chapter 0C if you're not registered, chapter 0E if you're updating from an
older version, and read all if you're new to E.  Some of the directories have
been archived to save space.
