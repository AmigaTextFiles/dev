SHORT: arq.h converted to arq.m for AmigaE v3

put the file arq.m to your emodules:tools/ drawer

to make full use of this archive you must have installed ARQ V 1.83.
I have included a simple easyrequest example that makes use of the
exteasyrequest object described in arq.m

USAGE: req TEXT="This is a requester." TITLE="WindowTitle" Buttons="Yes|No" REQTYPE=2 ICON=dh3:disk X=10 Y=15

returncode is the button you pressed. the rightmost button is always 0.
