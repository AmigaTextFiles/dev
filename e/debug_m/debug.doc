REQUIREMENTS :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Amiga E v3.0 and kickstart 1.3 or better.


INTRODUCTION :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    debug.m is the E module equivalent to the C linked library debug.lib.
If you already know this linked library, you can skip this introduction
and directly go to the TECHNICAL section.
    For those who don't know this link library, let me give you a little
explanation of its interest. Indeed, it contains simple input/output
functions for the serial port. Thanks to them, you can use a remote debug-
ging terminal linked to your Amiga via the serial port. But nobody have
a debugging terminal linked to his Amiga :-) So a solution is to used
Sushi which is developper tool (but also available on aminet) to intercept
raw serial debugging output and to redirect it to a simple CON window.
So every Amiga can take benefit from these function. But what is the
interest for a sample Amiga E user in relation to the WriteF() procedure ?
I see two advantages :
    - debugging output isn't mixed with normal output
    - you can't use functions like WriteF(), PrintF(), etc (in fact, all
the dos.library function) outside a process context, in other words, you
MUST use debug.m functions instead for exec tasks, devices, handlers, etc


EXAMPLE USING :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MODULE 'Tools/debug' -> of course you have put debug.m in EMODULES:Tools

PROC main()

    DEF var , str[ 100 ] : STRING

    -> a lot of critical calculations around var and str

    kputfmt( 'var = \d & str = \s\n' , [ var , str ] )
        -> breath deeply : you know now what var and str are :-)
        -> note that you called kputfmt() exactly as you would have done
        ->  for vprintf(), simple isn't it ?

    -> let's continue again critical things !

ENDPROC


TECHNICAL :
~~~~~~~~~~~
    The procedures of debug.m are :
    - kcmpstr( str1 : PTR TO CHAR , str2 : PTR TO CHAR )
    - char := kgetchar()
    - number := kgetnum()
    - char := kmaygetchar()
    - kputfmt( format_string : PTR TO CHAR , data_stream : PTR TO LONG )
    - kputchar( char )
    - kputstr( str : PTR TO CHAR )
    For further details, buy and read The Amiga Guru Book, an excellent
book.

    To do debug.m, I disassembled debug.lib, modified a bit the resulting
source (in fact I removed useless things for E users and adapted parameters
passing to E rules), reassembled it and finally used o2m.
