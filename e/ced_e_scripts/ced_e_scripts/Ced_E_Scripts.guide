                                What is it

               These are three ced arrexx scripts,

         1, SrcGen.ced
            This will load in a gadtoolsbox gui file and convert it
            to an Amiga E file,(needs SrcGen).

         2, Ecompile_&_Save.ced
            This will auto renumber and compile your Amiga E files

         3, Ecompile.ced
            This is by Rick Younie and this will run the E compiler only.
@endnode

@node "Document_1" "  Installing "


                           Installing

       1, Copy Cedscripts (Drw) into your S Directory.

       2, If no F keys have funtions assigned to them then just
          copy the Rexxcommands file to your S directory.
          
          If you have some F keys already assigned then enter
          these three commands to empty F keys using the following

          sys/s/cedscripts/Ecompile.ced
          
          sys/s/cedscripts/Ecompile_&_save.ced

          sys/s/cedscripts/SrcGen.ced.


      3,Change the assignment line from Ecompile_&_Save.ced
         
        from   ec = 'WORK:PROGRAMMING/amiga_e/bin/ecdemo'
        to the location of your ec file.

 
        Change the assignment line from Ecompile.ced  
        
        from    epath = 'work:programming/amiga_e/bin/' 
        to the location of your bin directory.


        Change the assignment line from SrcGen.ced

        from  srcgen  = 'dh1:programming/amiga_e/bin/srcgen'  
        to the location of your srcgen file.

@node "Document_2" "     Usage   "


                        Usage

       1, If using suppied Rexxcommands file,

          Load or create your e source file and press F1 to
          save if any changes have been made then compile
          and run it.

          Load or create your e source file and rename to 
          something like test.1.e ( the word test can be altered
          to anything you like ) then press F2 to save if no changes
          are made the source is compiled and run, If changes have
          been made the filename goes up one ie ( test.1.e becomes
          test.2.e ) and so on to keep original file, then it is 
          complied and run.
          
          Load Program.gui file (garbage on screen) then press
          F10 and wait a short time for the file to be converted
          and saved as the same name with the last bit altered 
          ie .gui becomes .e .

       2, If using your own setup,

          As above but using your F key settings instead of the
          above keys.
@endnode

@node "Document_3" "     Todo    "


                        ToDo

        Make a ced arrexx script to automatically change the filename
          from <program name.e> to <program name.001.e>   
          or <program name.gui> to <program name.001.e>.

        Any other Arexx scripts that you think could be useful please
            Email me and i shall see what i can do.

Short: Run SrcGen & E compilier directly from CED. Author:
steve@cliffe.demon.co.uk(steven chapman) Uploader:
steve@cliffe.demon.co.uk(steven chapman) Type: dev/e

Change in Wouter's Ecompile.rexx. You can run SrcGen from CED and
automatically save's it as the same name - gui + e.

ie (filename.gui becomes filename.e)

And auto number advance if any changes are made at time of compiling.

ie ( filename.1.e becomes filename.2.e ect)
