                          ----------------------

               A Minesweeper clone for the Oberon System V4



Oberon-Mines needs the Oberon System V4. The Oberon System is an operating
system, designed by N. Wirth, J. Gutknecht and M. Reiser.
Implementations exists for Amiga, Mac, IBM-PC, IBM-RS6000 and many
workstations. You can download the version, you are interested in, from
ftp.inf.ethz.ch (directory /pub/Oberon/) and the
Amiga version from any AmiNet-Site (dev/obero/Oberon.lha), too.
You can use Oberon-Mines on any computer, Systen V4 is available for,
just by recompiling the sourcecode. No changes need to be made to the
sourcecode. Read the files released with the system, how to use the system
and his compiler.

You are only authorized to spread the files like you get it.


How to use:
Oberon-Mines is a simple Minesweeper program as you know it from many
computers. I think, i don`t have do say anythink about the rules.
Copy the files Mines.Mod, MinesElems.Mod, Mines.Tool, Mines.Score,
Mines.Score.Text, Mines.Pal and Mines.Menu.Text to your Oberon directory
and compile Mines.Mod and MinesElems.Mod.


Start Mines by activating Mines.Open. If you open the Tool-file
(System.Open Mines.Tool), you will see any kown command and how to use them.

The right mousekey marks a field as a mine, the middle sets or clears a
? (only a help for your mind) and the left one shows the kind of the
field. Interclick clears the operation. If you select a field with a number
on it and interclick with right mousebutton, all neighbouring fields, that
are not marked as a mine, will be selected.
If you click at the smily at the top of the field, the game will restart.
You will see the number of mines to find left beside the smily and the
game time right beside it.
IF (system has a username) & (you like your username) THEN (Mines uses it)
ELSE (use Mines.SetUser to specify new username)
There are a color and a black&white mode of Mines. Choose the one you like
with Mines.ColorMode. If you use the color mode, it will only loke nice, if
you use the right colors. "Colos.Load Mines.Pal" will load them. The Windows
version uses the standard colors and does not need the Mines.Pal file.
Mines uses a background task to display the game time. The Time-Task kills
itself, if it is not nessecary anymore. If you do not like tasks running at
your system, Mines.TimeMode will switch to another mode. This mode displays
the time only if you select a field.

The smily shows the status of the game. If the smily is happy :-) , everything
is allright, you can play. A irresolute smily :-| tells you, that the pause
funktion is activated. If you hit a mine, the smily is very sad :-(. Try
again. If you find all mines, the smily is very happy and wears his
sun-glasses 8-) .

There are Mines-Elements for the Oberon Text System. You can insert a Mines-
Element at the caret position with MinesElems.Beginner, MinesElems.Advanced,
MinesElems.Expert and MinesElems.Insert. See the Mines.Tool text.
A Element is selected or not. A selected one has a doted line around it.
The mouseaction for a selected and not selected Elements are listed here
(R=right mousekey, M=..., L=...; second letter means interclick):
Not selected:  L     = select Element
               M  L  = start normal Mines game
               M  R  =   "     "      "     "

Selected:      L     = select field
               L  R  = multiselect
               R     = mark field as mine
               M     = shows number of mines to find
               M  L  = start new game
               M  R  = shows hi-score
