Type: dev/obero
Author: a.weinert@darkness.gun.de

  DebugLib.mod Revision 2

An Oberon inteface module the link library "debug.lib", this
makes possible to use the serial i/o for debugging uses, it's
also possible to redirect the output from DebugLib.PrintF()
with "sushi" in a shell.

New feature since revision 1:

  Added an ENV-Variable check to do the output only if
  it wanted.
