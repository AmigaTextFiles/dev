                         ------------------------

OberonPrefs is the very program for your Oberon system that you've missed
all the time - until now!;-) It's a very flexible, universal, intuitive,
highly user-configurable preferences editor for Oberon's compiler/linker
options that offers both, a comfortable graphical user interface and a
well-designed shell interface (which may be completely accessed via
icon ToolTypes, by the way).  Furthermore it adapts to the user's locale
-i.e. it uses your prefered tongue and meassure output characteristics-
if you run Workbench 2.1 or higher.


A brief summary on how Amiga Oberon gains the compiler / linker options:

  Firstly, the hardcoded internal default options of the Oberon system are
  considered.
  
  These options are overridden by the options you specify in the commandline
  (or by the ToolTypes of the invoked tool on Workbench start)
  
  Afterwards, options from the option preferences files Oberon.prefs and
  OLink.prefs in the directory of the processed project are taken into
  account (and overwrite any hitherto read options!)
  
  Finally, if the respective preferences file Oberon.prefs / OLink.prefs
  couldn't be found in the directory of the processed project and the
  respective global Oberon.prefs / OLink.prefs exists in the OBERON:
  directory, the options from this file are accounted.  Of course, these
  options override any previously read options, too.


In order to come up to the user's individual likes and configurations,
OberonPrefs is highly user-configurable in terms of reading and writing the
compiler / linker options.  This configuration can be set via a commandline
/ ToolTypes argument, a global settings file or via menus in the
interactive mode.


OberonPrefs basically has two different operation modes:  a global mode,
where the global compiler / linker options are processed, and a project
mode where the options for different projects and / or those for a single
source code module are processed.  It is straight forward that the
possiblity of mutual import / export between these modes exists.


OberonPrefs provides you with the ability to manipulate all currently
available compiler / linker options (as of Amiga Oberon 3.00) - for the
project mode including those that may be only controled from within source
code modules and whose scope is generally the whole source code module
(CodeChip, VarsChip, DataChip, Implementation).


As the user interfaces (interactive graphical user interface, commandline
interface, Workbench ToolTypes interface) have been designed in a way that
they usually comply with the guidelines for preferences editors stated in
the 'Amiga User Interface Style Guide', the utilization and operation of
OberonPrefs should be highly self-explaining and intuitive for the user who
is familar with operating Amiga preferences editors (e.g.  those placed in
the SYS:Prefs drawer of your boot disk).  However, the concept of two
different operation modes (Global / Project), the versatile options in the
Settings menu and the extension of the commandline / ToolTypes interface
for your ease when dealing with ARexx scripts and batch files are beyond
the ordinary prefs editors' features and deserve special attention.

                        the installation procedure
                        --------------------------

The installation is automatically performed by the installation script.  It
copies OberonPrefs and the documentation files into the OBERON:  directory
and writes the catalogs into the LOCALE:  directory if Workbench 2.1 or
higher is installed in your system.  In addition to this, the installation
script can also install die CyngusEd Arexx scripts for running the Oberon
system from within CygnusEd on your request.

It is recommended to add a 'resident OBERON:OberonPrefs' statement to your
s:user-startup if you use OberonPrefs and / or the ARexx scripts frequently.

  Gadgets
  -------

Apart from the gadgets for the various compiler / linker options which are
not described in this document since they are extensively discussed in the
Amiga Oberon documentation, the following gadgets are available:

Mode gadget - controls the operation mode:
  Global : for modifying the global compiler / linker options
  Project: for modifying project / source code module specific options
  *1*
  
Project Display gadget - displays the name of the currently selected source  
  code module in Project operation mode. If the gadget name consists of a
  character with an underscore, a keypress of that marked key selects the
  File gadget.
  
File gadget - pops up a file requester where you may select a new project.
  If you confirm the selection, OberonPrefs tries to open and validate the
  project, sets the Project operation mode and reads the project's options
  according to the settings in the Settings menu.
  *1*
  
Save gadget - in case the Project operation mode is active and no
  valid file name is known, a file requester pops up where you can
  select a project for the options to save. If the project can't be
  validated, no changes occure. Otherwise / afterwards the currently
  active options are saved according to the settings in the Settings
  menu _without_ quitting OberonPrefs (This was a design decision due
  to the two operation modes and the possibility of manipulating
  project settings).
  However, if one of the commandline / ToolTypes arguments OBERONOUT, 
  OLINKOUT or OMAKEOUT has been specified, OberonPrefs quits immediately
  after saving because no change of the operation mode or the processed
  project is possible in that case.
  *2*
  
Cancel gadget - quits OberonPrefs without saving any previously made
  changes.
  *1*
   
Use gadget - quits OberonPrefs without saving any previously made changes, 
  _but_ prints the selected options according to the specified #?OUT
  argument to stdout.
  *3*
  
Close gadget - corresponds to selecting the Cancel gadget. The key 
  equivalent for this system gadget is the ESC key.
  
Zoom gadget - iconifies OberonPrefs' window or restores its original size,  
  respectively. The key equivalent for this system gadget is the 'Z' key.
  

All gadgets whose titles contain an underscored character may be selected
by pressing the respective key, too.



*1* :  Is not available if one of the arguments OBERONOUT, OLINKOUT or
       OMAKEOUT has been specified at the program start.
       
*2* :  Is not available if one of the arguments OBERONOUT, OLINKOUT or
       OMAKEOUT plus the NOSAVEGAD switch has been specified at the 
       program start.

*3* :  Is only available if one of the arguments OBERONOUT, OLINKOUT or
       OMAKEOUT has been specified at the program start.



  -----
  Menus
  -----

Project menu:
  
  New - resets the options to the internal default options of Amiga-Oberon
  and clears the project name if the Project operating mode is active

  Open... - this is equivalent to triggering the File gadget
  
  Save As... - opens a file requester, and, if the name of an existing
  source code module is specified, enforces the Project operation mode
  and saves the currently selected options as the source code module's
  options.
  *1*
  
  Save As Globals - enforces the Global operation mode and saves the
  currently selected options as the global compiler / linker options.
  *1*
  
  About... - this makes OberonPrefs pop a requester with some information
    on OberonPrefs.
      In the last line of the requester, the code for the currently
      active settings in the Settings menu is displayed. This code may be
      written to ENVARC:OberonPrefs.prefs or supplied as a SETTINGS/N/K
      argument when starting OberonPrefs in order to retrieve the current
      settings in the Settings menu.
      *1*
      
  Quit - this menu item has the same effect as triggering the Cancel gadget.    
  
Edit menu:  

  Reset To Defaults - resets the options to the internal default options
    of the Amiga Oberon system.
    
  Last Saved Globals - imports the last saved global options, or, if none
    exist, to the internal default options of Amiga Oberon while the
    operation mode is not changed.
    
  Read From... - pops a file requester and, if the name of a valid source
    code module has been specified, imports the source code module's options
    without changing the operation mode and the project name.
    
  Re-Read - re-reads the options from disk, i.e. for the Global operation
    mode the last saved global compiler / linker options are imported, and
    for the Project operation mode, the project's last saved compiler / 
    linker are imported. This function is also known as 'Restore'.
    
Settings menu:    

  Create Icons? - if checked, OberonPrefs creates icons for projects
    without icons when saving the project's compiler / linker options.
    The icon data is taken from OBERON:Icons/txt.info, or if that does
    not succeed, the system default project icon data is employed for
    the job.
    *1*
    
  Write Options That Default? - if checked, even those compiler /
    linker options that correspond to the Oberon system's internal
    default options are written. 
    *1*
    
  Local Read submenu:  
    The settings of this submenu determine how OberonPrefs proceeds
    when reading a project's compiler / linker options. Firstly, the
    user can choose one of four ways:
    
      Module & Prefs - if checked, OberonPrefs starts reading the options
        from a possible OberonPrefs header line at the top of a source code
        module: if char options preceeded by 'OberonOpts' / 'OLinkOpts' are
        found within the header line, they are processed - the rest of the
        header line is ignored for now. Then, OberonPrefs tries to override
        these options with options read from Oberon.prefs resp. OLink.prefs
        option preferences files. Finally, the rest of the the header line
        is searched for valid source code options ($Option+, $Option-) which
        override the hitherto gained settings.
      
      Module (No Option Chars) & Prefs - corresponds to checked 
        'Module & Prefs', with the exception that the char options
        preceeded by 'OberonOpts' / 'OLinkOpts' within an OberonPrefs
        header line are ignored. As the Amiga Oberon system proceeds
        like this when gathering options, This is the internal default
        setting of OberonPrefs.
        
      Only Module - OberonPrefs only gathers options from OberonPrefs header
        lines, including both, char options and source code options.
         
      Only Prefs - OberonPrefs only considers only Oberon.prefs /
        OLink.prefs option preferences files.
        
    Moreover a toggle switch decides on the way Oberon.prefs / OLink.prefs
    are gathered:
    
      Prefs: Fallback To Global? - if checked, OberonPrefs tries to open
        the global option preferences files in the OBERON: directory if
        it can't find them in the project's directory. This corresponds
        to OberonPrefs internal default settings, as the Oberon system
        proceeds in exactly the same way.
        
  Local Write submenu:      
    The menu items of this submenu decide on the procedure OberonPrefs
    applies for writing project's compiler / linker options.
    *1*
    
      Stackable Opts As Source? - if checked, OberonPrefs writes those
        options that may be changed via commandline char options, via
        option preferences files and via source code options, as
        source code options into the source code module's OberonPrefs 
        header line. This was OberonPrefs' internal default setting up
        to OberonPrefs1.9. Starting from OberonPrefs1.10 it is the
        internal default setting of OberonPrefs to omit this.
        *1*      

      Write Option Chars? - if checked, OberonPrefs writes the
        char options for the compiler / linker invocation preceeded by
        'OberonOpts' / 'OLinkOpts' into the OberonPrefs header line of
        the source code module. This was OberonPrefs' internal default 
        setting up to OberonPrefs1.9. Starting from OberonPrefs1.10 it
        is the internal default setting of OberonPrefs to omit this.
        *1*
    
    In addition to this, one of four different handlings for writing
    option preferences files while saving a project's compiler / linker
    options can be selected:
    
      Write *.Prefs With Options - makes OberonPrefs write the
        option preferences files with the active compiler / linker
        options into the project's directory. This is the internal
        default setting of OberonPrefs.
        *1*
        
      Write Empty *.Prefs - makes OberonPrefs write empty option
        preferences files into the project's directory. This may be
        useful if the Amiga Oberon system shall operate without
        considering any options from preferences files.
        *1*      
        
      Don't Write *.Prefs - causes OberonPrefs to ignore all option
        preferences files and not to write any option preferences
        files. This may be useful for changing only the options of
        a specific source code module in a project directory without
        touching the options of the other source code modules in the
        same directory.
        *1*
        
      Delete *.Prefs - makes OberonPrefs delete option preferences  
        files present in the project's directory, and does not write
        back any option preferences files.
        *1*
      
    Finally you can set the mode for handling option ToolTypes in    
    project icons while saving project options:
    
      Write ToolTypes - induces OberonPrefs to write the active
        options as ToolTypes into the project icons. This was always
        the case up to OberonPrefs 1.9. If an 'old' SETTINGS value
        from OberonPrefs <= 1.9 is passed on program start or such
        an old SETTINGS value is picked from the ENVARC:OberonPrefs.prefs
        file, this is due to compatability considerations the default
        setting for OberonPrefs1.10 or newer.
        *1*  
         
      Ignore ToolTypes - makes OberonPrefs ignore any existing option
        ToolTypes within project icons. Moreover OberonPrefs does not
        modify any option ToolTypes. This is the normal internal default
        setting of OberonPrefs starting from OberonPrefs1.10
        *1*  
        
      Delete ToolTypes - causes OberonPrefs to delete existing option  
        ToolTypes in project icons without writing any option ToolTypes
        back into the icon.
        *1*
        
  Save Settings - this menu item saves the current settings of the
    Settings menu into the global ENVARC:OberonPrefs.prefs file so 
    that the settings may be retrieved whenever OberonPrefs is
    invoked later. (These settings are overridden by a specified
    commandline / ToolType SETTINGS/N/K argument)
    *1*


    
*1* :  Is not available if one of the arguments OBERONOUT, OLINKOUT or
       OMAKEOUT has been specified at the program start.
       


              ---------------------------------------
              dragging icons into OberonPrefs' window        
              ---------------------------------------

You may drag icons into OberonPrefs' window.  This corresponds to
  selecting the File gadget and specifying the icon's name in the
  file requester.
  *1*

*1* :  Is not available if one of the arguments OBERONOUT, OLINKOUT or
       OMAKEOUT has been specified at the program start.
       


                    -----------------------------------
                    commandline and ToolTypes arguments
                    -----------------------------------

The following is OberonPrefs' argument stencil:

FROM,TO=FILE,OBERONOPTS/K,OLINKOPTS/K,EDIT/S,USE=SAVE/S,OBERONOUT/S,
OLINKOUT/S,OMAKEOUT/S,GLOBAL/S,LOCAL/S,PUBSCREEN/K,NOGUI/S,NOSAVEGAD/S,
SETTINGS/N/K,
NoStackChk=S/S,NoOvflChk=V/S,NoRangeChk=B/S,NoCaseChk=C/S,NoReturnChk=R/S,
NoNilChk=N/S,OddChk=O/S,NoTypeChk=T/S,SmallCode=M/S,SmallData=D/S,
NoImplementation/S,NoGarbageCollector=A/S,NoExtensions=E/S,Debug=G/S,
NoClearVars=Z/S,Icons=I/S,NoNewSymbols=Y/S,Small/S,mc68881=8/S,
NoAutoRegPars=P/S,CodeChip/S,DataChip/S,VarsChip/S,mc68030=3/S,
mc68020=2/S,mc68010=1/S


Following now is a detailed description of each argument:

FROM - file name of the project whose compiler / linker options shall be
  read. There are two special names, so called 'magics':
    Global - reads the global compiler / linker options. (This is also
      the case if this argument is neglected)
    Default - sets the internal default options of the Amiga Oberon
      system.       
    The specification of the switches LOCAL/S or USE=SAVE/S have the effect
    that in case the TO=FILE argument is not passed and in case the FROM
    argument is no 'magic', the FROM arguemnt is used as the TO=FILE arg.
    
TO=FILE - file name of the project that shall be processed. The
  specification of this argument implies the LOCAL/S switch and
  excludes the specification of the GLOBAL/S switch.
  
OBERONOPTS/K,OLINKOPTS/K - see below

EDIT/S - switch that makes OberonPrefs operate in the interactive mode.
  Since this is the internal default setting of OberonPrefs, you can
  always omit this switch. The explicit specification of EDIT/S excludes
  the usage of the USE=SAVE/S and NOGUI/S switches.
  
USE=SAVE/S - switch that causes OberonPrefs to save the gathered compiler /  
  linker options without opening the interactive graphical user interface.
  This switch excludes the usage of EDIT/S, and assumes that an existing,
  valid project name has been passed as TO=FILE argument (that may stem
  from the FROM argument, see above for more) if the Project operation
  mode is active.
  
OBERONOUT/S  
OLINKOUT/S
OMAKEOUT/S  - these switches are mutually exclusive and have the effect
  that in case of non-failure termination the commandline option string
  with the option chars for Oberon / OLink / OMake is printed to the
  standard output chanel. These arguments are utterly important for
  OberonPrefs' utilization in batch files and ARexx scripts.
  The interactive graphical user interface of OberonPrefs is heavily
  modified by the specification of one of these arguments:
    It isn't possible to toggle the operation mode (Global / Project),
    and you can't process any other project than the one passed on
    startup. The Settings menu is heavily pruned: only the Local Read
    submenu is left. Instead of the Cancel gadget, a Use gadget is
    displayed (You can still access the Cancel operation by triggering
    the window's close gadget or by selecting the Project->Quit menu
    item), or, if the NOSAVEGAD/S switch is active, the Save gadget is
    replaced by the Use gadget. In this case, the Save function can't
    be accessed at all.
    
GLOBAL/S - This switch activates the Global operation mode (which is    
  OberonPrefs' internal default). This excludes the specification of
  the TO=FILE and LOCAL/S arguments.
  
LOCAL/S - This switch activates the Project operation mode. Thus, you  
  can't use the GLOBAL/S switch, of course. This switch is automatically
  activated if a non-magic FROM argument in connection with the
  USE=SAVE/S switch or simply a TO=FILE argument have been passed.
  
PUBSCREEN/K - Here you can specify the name of a public screen on wich  
  OberonPrefs should open its interactive graphical user interface.
  If the screen can't be found, a fallback to the system default public
  screen (which is OberonPrefs' internal default setting) takes place.
  
NOGUI/S - This switch is only reasonable in conjunction with one of
  the switches OBERONOUT/S, OLINKOUT/S or OMAKEOUT/S. It has the effect
  that the interactive graphical user interface is not opened despite an 
  inactive USE=SAVE/S switch. Instead of that, the respective compiler / 
  linker options are read, and printed to the standard output chanel
  according to the specified #?OUT/S switch. The specification of this
  switch is also allowed (but without any effect) in conjunction with
  the USE=SAVE/S switch.
  
NOSAVEGAD/S - This witch is only permitted in conjunction with a #?OUT/S  
  switch and an opened interactive graphical user interface. For a 
  detailed description of its effects, see the discussion of the #?OUT/S
  switches.
  
SETTINGS/N/K - This argument expects a valid decimal number which  
  decodes to valid settings of the Settings menu's options.
    The desired number can be easily found by modifying the Settings
    menu's options and selecting the Project->About... menu item
    afterwards. In the last text line of the information requester
    that pops up, the current settings number can be found.
    *1*
    
    
The remaining arguments have the purpose to activate / clear one or more
of the compiler / linker options:

OBERONOPTS/K - expects the specification of a valid option string for
  the Oberon compiler, consisting of an optional '-', followed by the
  option chars.
  
OLINKOPTS/K - expects the specification of a valid option string for
  the OLink linker, consisting of an optional '-', followed by the
  option chars.
  
NoStackChk=S/S,NoOvflChk=V/S,NoRangeChk=B/S,NoCaseChk=C/S,NoReturnChk=R/S,
NoNilChk=N/S,OddChk=O/S,NoTypeChk=T/S,SmallCode=M/S,SmallData=D/S,
NoImplementation/S,NoGarbageCollector=A/S,NoExtensions=E/S,Debug=G/S,
NoClearVars=Z/S,Icons=I/S,NoNewSymbols=Y/S,Small/S,mc68881=8/S,
NoAutoRegPars=P/S,CodeChip/S,DataChip/S,VarsChip/S,mc68030=3/S,
mc68020=2/S,mc68010=1/S - sets / clears a particular option.



*1* :  Is not available if one of the arguments OBERONOUT, OLINKOUT or
       OMAKEOUT has been specified at the program start.
       
  
  
     user definable interactive argument request on Workbench start  
     --------------------------------------------------------------  

OberonPrefs provides you with the ability to gather specific, several, or
all arguments with interactive argument string requesters if it is started
from Workbench and you have installed reqtools.library V38 or higher (which
is copyright by Nico François, by the way) in your system. In order to make
OberonPrefs do this, you have to create valid ToolType entries, with a
preceeding 'ASK:' prefix, e.g. 'Ask:Settings=971' and so on.



                    program termination & return codes
                    ----------------------------------

If OberonPrefs is quit using either the Save gadget, the Use gadget or
by pressing the corresponding key equivalents, it returns a return code
of 0 (OK). If the graphical user interface is not opened due to the
supplied arguments, and OberonPrefs terminates properly, it returns 0
(OK), too.  Otherwise, if OberonPrefs terminates due to the Project->Quit
menu item, the windows's close gadget, due to presssing ESC, due to the
Cancel gadget or its key equivalent, it returns 5 (WARN). In all other
cases - i.e. whenever OberonPrefs terminates because of invalid arguments
or insufficient system resources, it returns 20 (FAIL), and if not one
of the #?OUT/S switches was specified, it prints a failure message to the
standard output chanel and flashes the screen in case it was started from
Workbench.




                     general issues about the program
                     --------------------------------

Valid projects for OberonPrefs are existing text files whose name end
with a '.mod' suffix. OberonPrefs has, like the other Oberon system's
tools the ability to automatically append the '.mod' to any specified
file name, and to look also in a 'txt' sub-directory for the file if
the file could not be found in the specified directory.


The CodeChip+, DataChip+, VarsChip+ and Implementation- settings are 
volatile for the Global operation mode since they can be only specified
within source code modules, i.e. they can't be saved as the global
compiler / linker options. Thus, if you convert a project's compiler /
linker options into the global compiler / linker options, or if you read
project options only emloying the *.prefs option preferences files,
those settings are lost.


A small note on the used ToolTypes parsing:  The unique ToolTypes parsing
functions of BlackMagic which support the AmigaDOS-ReadArgs()
templates extensively, and also offer the nifty 'Arguments Request'
feature (see above for more) are used.

                   how to avoid source code modification
                   -------------------------------------
                   
If you want to avoid the creation of OPREFS header lines on the
long run, you should deselect the menu toggles

* Settings->Save·Options·That·Default?

and

* Settings->Local·Write->Stackable·Opts·As·Source?

and

* Settings->Local·Write->Write·Option·Chars?


and save these settings with the menu item 

*Settings->Save·Settings


          * Starting from OberonPrefs 1.10 these settings are *
          * the  internal  default  settings  of  OberonPrefs *
  


                              program history
                              ---------------

  v1.0 [fSchwarz] 28.6.93  First fully functional version

  v1.1 [fSchwarz] 4.7.93  Removed stupid bug in argument
    processing order: processed SETTINGS after FROM & TO

  v1.2 [fSchwarz] 6.7.93  Added display clip sensitivity
    when rendering x/y positions, pr.windowPtr redirection

  v1.3 [fSchwarz] 6.7.93  Added warning requester for
    filenames not ending in '.mod', changed requester code

  v1.4 [fSchwarz] 9.7.93  Added 'OberonPrefs failed' msg &
    Int.DisplayBeep() in case of failure, Dos.IoErr support

  v1.5 [fSchwarz] 16.7.93  Fixed Asl.save-Flag FReq bug

  v1.6 [fSchwarz] 17.7.93  Removed ~'.mod' warn requester,

    '.mod' suffix, search in 'txt' subdirectory)

  v1.7 [fSchwarz] 21.7.93  Adapted to new BlackMagic layout

  v1.8 [fSchwarz] 14.8.93  Recompiled with BlackMagic 1.10:
    now argument requesters may pop up if wbstarted

  v1.9 [fSchwarz] 9.9.93  fixed mc680x0 option management
    due to very strange compiler feature: Enabling 68030
    instruction generation does NOT imply generation of
    68020/68010 instructions, etc.

  v1.10 [fSchwarz] 10.9.93  Added user control of Project-
    ToolTypes writing via Settings menu; changed default
    settings so that usually no source writes are needed.

  v1.11 [fSchwarz] 13.9.93  Minor cosmetic code changes,
    now works well with a NIL Asl.base, added
    complete English docs, corrected German docs, updated
    strings.

  v1.11a [fSchwarz] 17.9.93 Added Busypointer & window
    blocking during writing / reading operations (suggested
    by Christian Stiens)

  v1.11b [fSchwarz] 18.9.93 now also locked GUI during
    ValidateFName() due to packing filesys like XFH, etc.

  v1.11c [fSchwarz] 18.9.93 DisplayBeeps if ValidateFName()
    fails in interactive mode.

  v1.11d [fSchwarz] 20.9.93 Now writes OLink.prefs options
    in complete upper case.

The interactive graphical user interface was created with assistance of
GadToolsBox 37.176 by Jan van der Baard und Kai Bolay (Oberon source
generator).  Without GadToolsBox, OberonPrefs would have hardly ever been
realized. Three galactic Gargle Blaster cheers for them;-)
The CygnusEd ARexx scripts use Kai Bolay's oberonsupport.library, and
some parts of the ARexx scripts are also written by him.
The reqtools.library, OberonPrefs can take advantage of, is written and
copyrighted by Nico François, but freely distributable if this fact
is mentioned in the accompanying program documentation.


Have fun,

                        the CygnusEd Arexx scripts
                        --------------------------

The CyngusEd ARexx scripts provide you with a comfortable interface of
CygnusEd Professional to your Oberon system.  The following brief
introduction assumes that the enclosed function key mapping of CygnusEd is
activated.

F1 - Compile: Invokes the compiler. If the module has been modified and it
  is unsaved yet, it is saved right before compilation. The first compiler
  error is displayed after compiling if errors occured.
  
F2 - Link: Invokes the linker

F3 - Make: Invokes the OMake make utility. If the module has been modified
  and it is unsaved yet, it is saved right before invoking OMake.


Compile, Link and OMake use the following compiler / linker options:
  if valid temporary options for the project exist from a former 
  'F7 - Change Temporary Options' invocation, those are used. Otherwise
  the options are gained by invoking OberonPrefs with activated 
  'Settings->Local Read->Module & Prefs' and
  'Settings->Local Read->Prefs: Fallback to Global?'' menu items.
  
F4 - First Error: Jumps to the first compiler error

F5 - Next Error: Jumps to the next error relative to the cursor

F6 - Prev. Error: Jumps to the previous error relative to the cursor

F7 - Change Temporary Options: Set / invalidate temporary options for
  a source code module. If the module has been modified and it is
  unsaved yet, it is saved right before the OberonPrefs invocation.
  
F8 - Change Options: Unrestricted manipulation of compiler / linker  
  options of arbitrary projects and of the global options using
  OberonPrefs. If the currently edited text is an oberon source
  code module that has been changed and which is unsaved yet, it
  is saved right before the invocation of OberonPrefs. If you changed
  the options of the currently edited module, you should re-open
  the mdoule with the CygnusEd menu item Project->Open... after 
  quitting OberonPrefs.
  
  
If you use the ARexx scripts regularly, I recommend making OberonPrefs
resident by invoking 'resident OBERON:OberonPrefs'


For detailed information on the ARexx scripts, have a look at the scripts
themselves.
