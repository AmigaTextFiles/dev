                      ===================

    Usage:
      CheckNonExportIdent PATTERN/A,EXEPTFILE

    This program checks a Oberon modules for not exported
    identifiers. If at least one such identifier is found, the
    module name is printed out and all found identifers. In this
    case the programm will return error code 5 (WARN) on exit.
    Return code 0 (OKAY) means all identifiers are exported.

    When specifying a pattern instead of an unique filename,
    CheckNonExportIdent checks all modules matching the pattern. If
    at least one ident has not been exported in any of the modules,
    the programm will return error code 5 (WARN) on exit.

    You can also pass a file containing a list of identifiers to be
    ignored for the check. See example below.

    Only identifiers on level 0 (this is not nested within a
    procedure) are testet. Record or struct fields will be displayed
    in the form <record>.<fieldname>.

    This module is very usefull for checking wether all idents e.g.
    in an interface module are really exported.

    Exeptions file:
      For every module with identifiers to be ingnored, create a
      list like that:

         MODULE io
         IMPORT: foobar
         IMPORT: blafasel
         Semaphore.tag
         data

      First line hold the keyword 'MODULE' followed by the module
      name. The following lines contain the identifiers to be
      ignored, each in a seperate line. Identifiers defined in the
      IMPORT part of the module are prefixed with 'IMPORT: '.
      So the file looks nearly like the output of
      CheckNonExportIdent, exept the 'MODULE' line.

      The exeptions file may contain any number of thus lists.

    Note:
      The identifiers to be ignored are tested by simple string
      match, so you must not use spaces within the qualified ident.
      Empty lines are ignored.

      Due to a restriction in one of the used modules, only the
      first 80 charakters of each qualified ident is used for
      testing.

    Enjoy it!
