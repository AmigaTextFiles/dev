    How to submit bug reports for the Amiga-Oberon Development System
    =================================================================

Report Notes
------------
- Please write all reports in english as far as possible, because the
  further development of Amiga-Oberon is an international project.

- Please describe only one bug or one enhancement request per report.


* Bugreports and enhancement requests
-------------------------------------
Bugreports and enhancement requests for the Amiga-Oberon Development System
should be created by OReport (see below where to get it) and send to
'Amiga-Oberon-Bugs@oberon.nbg.sub.org' (usually OReport will do it for you).
This will help us to forward your reports to the person which is in charge
of the product. Thanks!


* Interfaces
------------
Previously bugreports for Amiga-Oberon interfaces had to be send to a
special address. From now on you should use OReport to create these reports
and send it to 'Amiga-Oberon-Bugs@oberon.nbg.sub.org', too. The old
address will stay valid for some time, but this is subject of change.


New versions
------------
The release of any new version will be announced on the AMOK-Mailinglist.
Send HELP in the message body to "majordomo@listserv.uni-stuttgart.de" for
infos how to subscribe. The name of the mailinglist is "amok-l".

How to get OReport
------------------
* You will find new releases on Aminet (dev/obero/OReport.lha).

* If you can't access aminet you can request OReport from
  mail-server@oberon.nbg.sub.org with subject "request"
  and body "SEND Amiga-Oberon/OReport.lha" (without quotes,
  why you ask ;-).
