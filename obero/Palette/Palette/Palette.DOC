Welcome to Palette 1.01

Actually there is not much to say about this module. Have a look
at PaletteTest.MOD and you'll understand how it works. There is
one thing that might look strange to you. Have a look at 
PaletteTest.MOD in line 25. You have to create a variable within
the main program. When you first call Palette.ShowPalette the
colours are going to be stored in this RECORD. You don't have to
initialize this field beforehand. This will be done automatically.
The reason herefore is the RESET gadget in the palette window. When 
klicking RESET you get back the colours before the first change made 
with the palette window. CANCEL only cancels the changes from the last 
session in the palette window.

SYNOPSIS:

ShowPalette(Screen, ColourRecord, ActiveColour)

Screen       = pointer to Screen (e.g. VAR Scr: I.ScreenPtr);
ColourRecord = Record of Colours (e.g. VAR ColRec: palette.colorRecord
ActiveColour = Colour to be shown (any number within 0<x<2^depth-1).

I hope it is clear how it works, if not then complain and I'll try to
do more work on this document!
