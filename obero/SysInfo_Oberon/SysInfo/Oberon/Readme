            Amiga-Oberon Interface for SysInfo.library v1.30 /
         ___________________________________________________/


This  is  the  interface  module  for  the  AmigaOberon compiler (v3.20) by
Fridtjof Siebert.

I have converted 1:1 the program 'uptime' and 'test' to test the interface.
Have a look at these to learn how to use the interface.

If    you    have    problems   or   questions,   send   requests   to   me
(T.Igracki@bamp.berlinet.de).
