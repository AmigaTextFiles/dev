ioSet.mod      - support module needed by CatCompMO.mod

Installing CatCompMO
********************

You should copy the CatCompMO executable to a directory in the shell's
search patch. I suggest OBERON:, if you are using Amiga Oberon, or M2:,
if you are using M2Amiga.

In the same directory you must copy the empty module frames,
ModulaCCMO.def and ModulaCCMO.mod for M2Amiga; OberonCCMO.mod for Amiga
Oberon.

If you are using Amiga Oberon, you have to copy Locales.mod to a
project directory that is in your Oberon:Path setting and compile it
there.

Using CatCompMO
***************

CatCompMO can be used from the shell, similar to Commodore's CatComp.
The template is:

DESCRIPTOR/A,MODULE/A,CATALOG/A,OBERON/S

DESCRIPTOR is the name of the catalog-description file that shall be
compiled.

MODULE is the base name of the module(s) that shall be created. For
M2Amiga, a .def and a .mod file is written, for Amiga Oberon only a
.mod file. You can supply a complete path here, if you need.

CATALOG is the name of the .catalog-files you have created (or will
create) with the normal CatComp. You can omit the extension .catalog,
if you like to.

OBERON is the switch that defines that Amiga Oberon code shall be
produced. If you omit it, M2Amiga files are written.

An example how to use CatCompMO:

     CatCompMO babylonia.cd babylonia babylonia OBERON
               ^            ^         ^         ^
               |            |         |         Oberon source shall be written
               |            |         the catalogs are named "babylonia.catalog"
               |            the module to be written shall be named "babylonia.mod"
               the catalog-description file is named "babylonia.cd"

Compiling CatCompMO
*******************

CatCompMO has been written using Amiga Oberon 3.11 and Interfaces 40.15.
With these tools, you can compile it yourself, if you want to. The
complete sources are included and consist of CatCompMO.mod and the
support module ioSet.mod. In addition, you need MoreStrings.mod from
hartmut Goebel which can be found on AMOK, too.
