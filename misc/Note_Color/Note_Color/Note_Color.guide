@NODE WI_Main "Note Color"
Thank you for getting my Color Note utility.
I hope you find it useful.

If you are a programmer and you have a color printer or you want to view your
source code with different colors then you should use this program.

It lets you paint a different part of your source code in different color.
View the example file and see the results.


		@{" File Name " link GR_File_Name }
		@{" Main Color " link GR_Main_Color }
		@{" String Match " link GR_String_Match }
		@{" Go ! " link GR_grp_5 }
@ENDNODE
@NODE GR_File_Name "File Name"
Enter source file name.
The output file will be the same file name with .color added to it.
@ENDNODE
@NODE GR_Main_Color "Main Color"
This is the main color for your output file.
This color effects all the text that not inside a match part.
The colors are from color 0 to color 7, I didn't give those colors' names,
Because every printer or text viewer uses its own color set, it is up to the user
to choose his best colors.
@ENDNODE
@NODE GR_grp_5 "Go !"
Go ! Will start the color routine.
When the operation has done, you can view/print the result file.
Use a color text viewer like the one in Dopus or muchmore etc.
Use a color printer like Cannon BJC-600 that I have :) 

Copy Icon if set will copy the icon of your file to the result file. 
@ENDNODE
@NODE GR_String_Match "String Match"
Here you choose the text match patterns and the color for the text inside it.
For examples C & C++ programmers will have // for the start match and nothing to 
the end match (it will paint the text up to the end of line.) 
They also have the /* for the start match and */ for the end match.

The cycle gadget has 9 states:

	DISABLED          : The program ignores the text in this line.
	color 0 -- color 7 : the color for the text inside the match patterns.
