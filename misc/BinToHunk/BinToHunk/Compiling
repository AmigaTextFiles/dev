The distributed BinToHunk executable has been linked with with an
unreleased version of the BuRP C Library.  The library has been working
very well but is not quite ready to be released.  If you don't want to be a
guinea pig, recompile it.  It may need some modifications to work under the
current version of the BuRP port of GCC. 

BinToHunk has also been compiled and tested under Lattice C 5.04.  It
displayed some warning messages but they were due to problems with
prototypes in the headers and should not cause a problem.  I see no reason
why it shouldn't work with newer versions. 

To compile under (SAS/)Lattice C:

  LC -b0 BinToHunk.c
  Blink LIB:c.o BinToHunk.o usage.o TO BinToHunk LIB LIB:lc.lib

To compile under GCC:

  gcc -O BinToHunk.c usage.o -o BinToHunk

If usage.o is missing or usage.txt is modified, usage.o must be remade
using BinToHunk:

  BinToHunk -l -t usage.txt usage.o _usage_message

If you don't have a working BinToHunk executable, you will have to define
the symbol BOOTSTRAP when compiling BinToHunk.c and leave usage.o out of
the command line.  Use `-dBOOTSTRAP' for Lattice or `-DBOOTSTRAP' for GCC.
