Maper must NOT be used for
commercial use without authors
permission!!! Hacking this soft is
immoral (and useless).

@title "Maper.guide - Why I did it."
@{jcenter}
Excuse my pure English!...Thanx

I was working on a Dungeon and I created maps by 
hands and numeric keyboard. It was dificult with map
20x20x3... So I started with finding Map Editors on 
AmiNet, I found about 5 Editors, and Started with trying
their functions...
There was NO (I think) Editor with multi-level Editing 
functions, so I wrote Maper in AmigaE v3.2e by
Wouter van Oortmerssen (thanks you!)
It can Import data of "MAP " format and much more formats
written by me! Good Looking Editors was written in AMOS, 
so no AGA Maps...

I hope you will like this programm, you will register 
this programm  and you will send me your Suggestions or
Ideas or Bug Reports. @{" Address " link address}

@{jcenter}      I wrote this Programm for all Amigians who trusts and
stayed with Amiga in her hard times...
Grrr...Co**odore...
#?!$%&...EsC*M...
Uffff...VisC*RP...

Because I`m only a pure Amigian(?!) and I hate programmers
who did useless programms and wants for it eg.: $50...
so I think that prices $1, £1, 1 DM or $1 equivalent are 
cheaper than cheap...
Every Amigian can buy Maper for its wonderful price...

When I will receive similar message I will do the version 
which will not open the requester when you starts Maper. 
In Project Menu will be new Item @{i}User@{ui}, with your name, 
address, registration number etc...

When I will receive your envelope I
will E-Mail you the UUCoded Maper...

If you dont have access to Internet so send me in your 
Envelope a 3½" AmigaDOS Formated Disk else I will format 
it to AmigaDOS format! Than put in to the Envelope stamps
to sent it back to you...

I hope that`s all!

If you will create a map small map: eg.: 8x8x1 with block
size 16x16 Maper will draw Map 10x10! Last two columns
and lines will drew of illegal blocks, if you will over write
this blocks Maper will crash your Amiga!
@{fg fill}2:@{fg text}
If you will scroll with scrollers
and while pressing the LMB you will
move your Mouse over the Map, the
strange thigs will happen...

In next Version I will eliminate
this bugs.
