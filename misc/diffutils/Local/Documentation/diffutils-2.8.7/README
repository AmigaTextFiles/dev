This is the Amiga (clib2 - linunix) version of diffutils - http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/

You can use the diff command to show differences between two files, or each corresponding file in two directories.
You can use the cmp command to show the offsets and line numbers where two files differ.
You can use the diff3 command to show differences among three files.
You can use the sdiff command to merge two files interactively.

Please repport everything You find strage, or would like to get changed to hnl_dk@amigaos.dk.

Best regards,
