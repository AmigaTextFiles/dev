     Chapter 1 Introducing HunkX     

       HunkX is a small utility written completely in Assembler to
     show the hunkx structure of any segment-loadable file.  It has
     been tested with normal Amiga executables, object files,
     libraries, Lattice C linker libraries, all with or without
     debugging or symbol information.  Note that the Aztec C linker
     libraries are not supported since they are not standard.  All
     the new hunks in KickStart 2.0 are also supported.  

       Non-programmers won't have a lot of use for HunkX.  It display
     technical information that can be useful for programmers only.

     1.1 System requirements      

       HunkX should run on any Amiga system with at least 512KB RAM
     and one disk-drive.  HunkX requires KickStart v2.04 or higher to
     run.  

       Should you have any trouble running HunkX on your machine,
     please write to me with the full specifications of your machine,
     that is KickStart version, model, expansion boards etc...  


     1.2 About the program

     you find any bugs, please let me know.  

       When sending in bug reports, please state exactly under what
     circumstances the bug occurred, what equipment was used and what
     happened.  If possible also try to give me enough information to
     reproduce the bug.  It is very difficult to find bugs when you
     don't know exactly what happened.

     1.3 Usage       

       HunkX is for CLI usage only.  Trying to run HunkX from the
     Workbench may result in a system crash.  

       If you run HunkX without any arguments get a message similar
     to the following one: 

             HunkX v2.00 by Peter Stuer (2.7.92 18:56:08) FREEWARE 
             Examines the hunk structure of an executable file.  

       If you run HunkX with an questionmark (?) as argument you'll
     get the argument template: 

             FROM/A/M,V=VERBOSE/S: 

       You can supply as many arguments as you like. If the argument
     is a directory or a device all the files in that directory or
     device will be examined.  

       If you also supply the VERBOSE switch HunkX will show you a
     lot more information f.e. all the debugging symbols (if any).  

       The output can be stopped at any time by pressing Control-C.
