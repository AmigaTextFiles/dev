DISCLAIMER

MMU with Kickstart 1.2 or later...

WHAT IT DOES

Installs emulation of Virtual Memory of a specific size and checks the
usage of this memory.

Improper usage of the virtual memory space is reported in the form

Software Error:
Task '<name>' (0x<task struct adr>)
PC: 0x<program counter> accessing 0x<memory address>
Error: <error description>


The error description may be one of the following:

Description: Address beyond virtual memory accessed.
Probable cause: Accessed an address outside the allowed memory.
Recovering: Check your pointers, perhaps you reused a freed memory chunk

Description: Task is not owner of virtual memory.
Probable cause: You used virtual memory for I/O or for message passing.
Recovering: Do buffered I/O and set MEMF_PUBLIC for messages and ports

Description: Page fault while Disable().
Probable cause: You accessed virtual memory within Disable()
Recovering: Check the necessity of Disable() and use MEMF_PUBLIC for
memory used within Disable()

Description: Page fault while Forbid().
Probable cause: You accessed virtual memory within Forbid()
Recovering: Check the necessity of Forbid() and use MEMF_PUBLIC for
memory used within Forbid()

Description: Page fault from Supervisor mode.
Probable cause: You used virtual memory from supervisor mode or put
program code into virtual memory.
Recovering: use MEMF_PUBLIC when you need supervisor mode or copy
program code.

Description: Page fault from interrupt. Need to reboot.
Probable cause: An intserver struct of the associated code/data was
placed into virtual memory.
Recovering: Set MEMF_PUBLIC for memory used in conjunction with
interrupts.


HOW TO HANDLE

All parameters to CyberGuard are optional.

Usage:	CyberGuard [-alq] [KEYWORDS]

'name' specifies which task is may use Virtual Memory.

Keywords:

BUFFERSIZE=BS <number>	: Specify size of buffer memory in bytes
MEMPRI=MP <number>	: 'number' = 0 -> No Virtual Memory for this prg
			  'number' = 1 -> Physical memory has priority
			  'number' = 2 -> Virtual memory has priority
			  'number' = 3 -> Only virtual memory is given
			  to this program.
NICEDEVICE=ND <device>	: Do not to check mask for this device!
SETTINGS=ST <filename>	: Preferences file
VIRTUALSIZE=VS <number>	: Specify size of virtual memory in bytes


Options:

-a	Avail		; Show available memory
-l	Library		: Add library to system/update library settings!
-q	Quit		: Removes CyberGuard from memory

Once CyberGuard is installed, you may use CyberGuard without parameters
to display the current status of CyberGuard.
