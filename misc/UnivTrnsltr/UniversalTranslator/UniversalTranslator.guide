@{b}Introduction@{ub}



Universal Translator is a program that will convert catalog description
files into source code for a program's internal strings, or to an external
catalog file for other languages.


There are several other programs that do this, also.  They all have their
own special features and way of handling catalog description and catalog
translation files.  Universal Translator has taken the best features of each
program and made them better.  It also hase some features unique to Universal
Translator.


Universal Translator also handles catalogs in a much more efficient and
convenient manner.  Only one file is required, not two, like other programs
require.


All other comparible catalog description converter programs require the
user to maintain @{b}two@{ub} files for @{b}one@{ub} catalog.  They require a
catalog description file, ex. program.cd, and a catalog translation file,
ex. program.ct.


To make an external catalog with some other program, such as CatComp, the
programmer has to release a catalog translation file with blank lines for the
person to translate the strings.  The translator then sends it back to the
program's author who converts it to a catalog description file, hoping the
translator got all his needed preferences correct.  He then converts it to an
external catalog file.


This sequence takes two more steps than Universal Translator and has no
guarantee that the strings will be the correct length since catalog translation
files have no preferences in them.  If the string is too short or long, and the
programmer doesn't know the language, he would have to send it back, or just
send an e-mail message, to the translator to get it adjusted.  This could take
several days.


Universal Translator only requires @{b}one@{ub} file, a catalog description file.


To make an external catalog using Universal Translator works much the same.
The programmer releases a blank catalog @{b}description@{ub} file with blank
lines for the translated strings.


The difference here is that all the programmer's preferences for each
string is included, so the translator will get the string correct the first
time.  The strings are also laid out the way they will be seen in the program,
as in all linefeeds will start a new line, instead of having one long line
that could easily be mis-translated.


The translator returns the catalog description file to the programmer and
he converts it directly to an external catalog, or even source code for
internal strings.


Using Universal Translator requires only one file, the blank catalog
description file, which will be translated more accurately, makes less work
for the programmer, supports all popular programming languages, and countless
other minor, but important, aspects will be handled correctly.

@{b}Creating A Catalog Description File@{ub}



Creating a catalog description file is quite simple.  The file consists of

only two sections: the header and the body of strings.  It is best to group

strings according to their source code module, not just thrown in at the end of

the file.  Keeping them organized into groups and in sequence with the source

code will make updating the strings much easier.



The header consists of the three lines:


## version $VER: program.catalog version (date) comment

## language xxxxx

## codeset 0


example:


## version $VER: universaltranslator.catalog 15.2 (20.07.94) Internal strings

## language english

## codeset 0


The entire version line must be only one line, 256 characters.

Set codeset to 0, it is unused at this time.



The body of the catalog description file is where all the work is

accomplished.  For each string, there must be: an indentifier, a preferences

structure, and the string itself.


All identifiers must be all capitals and begin with: MSG_.  Every string

must have a preferences structure: (//).


MSG_LIBS_COULD_NOT_OPEN_INTUITION_LIBRARY (1//)

Could not open Intuition library.

MSG_LIBS_COULD_NOT_OPEN_GRAPHICS_LIBRARY (//)

Could not open Graphics library.


It is best to make the identifier the same as the string for easy

identification.


The prefences structure consists of three flags: (string number/minimum

characters/maximum characters).  A string number doesn't have to be given for

every string, they will automatically be numbered and changed only when

specified then numbered automatically after the new number.  The minimum and

maximum characters should not be used very often.  The user interface should

adjust to the strings, not the strings to the user interface.

A semi-colon as the first character designates a comment.


Keeping the strings grouped by subject will make updating easier.


MSG_ABOUT_TEXT (//)

%s\\n\\

By: %s\\n\\n\\

Version: %s     Released: %s\\n\\n\\

Copyright © 1993-1994   All Rights Reserved


The above lines are all for one string.  At the end of each line there is a

backslash, \\, to indicate that there is more data for this string.  By

splitting the string into multiple lines, just like it will be displayed on

screen, will make it much easier to read and translate.


The following is a list of backslash control sequences accepted by

Universal Translator and other program:


  \\0    NULL

  \\a    Display beep

  \\b    Backspace

  \\t    Tab

  \\n    Line feed

  \\v    Vertical tab

  \\f    Form feed

  \\r    Carriage return

  \\e    Escape

  \\c    Control sequence introducer

  \\\\    The backslash itself

  \\"    Quote

  \\xHH  ASCII code HH (Where HH are hex digits 0-9, A-F)

  \\###  ASCII code ### (Where ### are octal digits 0-7)


When counting characters for either a minumum or maximum number, each one

of these counts as one character except \\xHH which counts as two.

@{b}Converting A Blank Catalog Description File@{ub}



Converting a blank catalog description file is very simple, you just fill

in the blanks, literally.


Fill in the header with your name as the translator, the date, and to which

language you translated the strings to.  Do not change anything else.


## version $VER: universaltranslator.catalog 15.2 (20.07.94) Translated by: [Your Name]

## language xxxxxxx

## codeset 0


The strings are laid out just like the programmer did in the original

description file.  All the comments are copied also.

MSG_LIBS_COULD_NOT_OPEN_INTUITION_LIBRARY (1//)

Impossible d'ouvrir la librairie Intuition.         <-- Your translation here.

Dois-je en ouvrir une?                              <-- Your translation here.

; Should I open one?

;



If the first character is a backslash, \\, then that is notifying you that

the line is split across more than one line.  The backslash must be left as the

last character to signal Universal Translator that there are more lines to the

string.  Do not count the backslash as part of the string and be sure not to

duplicate it.



The first space between the semi-colin and the string is not part of the

string.


If there is a string like the one below:



MSG_STRING_NOT_USED_BUT_RESERVED (//)


MSG_NORMAL_STRING (//)

Normal String



then you must put "\\0" for the string or you will get an undefined string

error.

Grouping and naming strings according to their source module will make
updating much easier.


Splitting a long line into multiple lines will make it easier to read and
translate.  Use a backslash as the last character for each line to signal more
line.


Do not put a minimum or maximum length on a string unless absolutely
necessary.  The user interface should adjust to the strings, not the strings
to the user interface.


Universal Translator can easily be put into an SMakefile to update the
strings automatically.


When strings are added to a catalog, all the source code modules must be
re-compiled so the string number are changed.  If a program has no locale
strings in it, then name the object module with the suffix '.oo', and objects
modules with locale strings with the standard '.o' suffix.  Then just
delete #?.o, and you only have to re-compile the modules that have locale
strings.

This program requires at least version V39 of the operating system
software.  This is to take advantage of the new commands and new tags.  It
is now easy enough to update your system so it should not pose a problem.


This program requires less than 512K of RAM, therefore it should
operate on all systems.


To use the full potential, a harddrive and 4 or more megs or RAM are
recommended but not required.


The user interface can be quite large at times.  I strongly suggest you use
a screen size of 800x600 or larger.  If use a smaller size, the interface may

@{b}About Swiss Army Knife Utilities@{ub}



The Swiss Army Knife Utilities is an every growing collection of programs
written by Mark Ritter.  All of these programs were written for a few basic
reasons: to make programming more automated, to replace poorly written
programs, or to fill a void where a program did not exist.


These programs are mostly meant to be replacement programs for poorly written,
or out dated programs.  Every needed feature has been incorporated to make the
programs powerful, yet very simple to use.


All of the utilities have been built around the gtlayout.library user interface
library.  MUI is an excellent package, but it is too CPU intensive and is not
based on the standard GadTools gadgets.  It all comes down to a matter of
preference.


The Swiss Army Knife Utilities have been written in well planned modular code.
All the programs have the same interface layout, the same AmigaGuide layout,
and the same operation.  If you know how one program works, then you know how
all of the programs work.  This modular code also makes for quick and easy
updates for every program.


Some of the global features:

    · They are all Commodities.

    · When iconified, it does so with an AppIcon and an AppMenu.

    · Drag-n-drop on AppIcon.

    · Extended select with AppIcon and AppMenu.

    · Drag-n-drop into window.

    · Extended select supported at startup.

    · Press Help for on-line AmigaGuide support.

    · Universal command line arguments.

    · Asl file requesters remember last path and file.

    · Fully localized and font sensitive.

    · Supports screennotify.library.

    · Most string gadgets have history.


Most of the programs have small interfaces, but a few are quite large.  All
of the programs are best used on an 800x600 screen; some will not fit on a
smaller screen.  800x600 is the standard, so the programs have been written for
this screen size.

@NODE ProgramHistory "Program History"
@TOC Main
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Program History@{ub}



Version 1.0     Completed: 20-Sep-93

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Preliminary construction.



Version 1.1     Completed: 26-Sep-93

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- No longer puts the full AppID in the AppStrings[] struct since it is just a

  number from the #define statement, just the actual ID number.

- For strings longer than 256 characters, you can use a backslash (\) as the

  last character of the first line (byte 256) as a "continue next line"

  identifier then continue the string on the next line.

- Added a GUI.

- Changed and added some command line arguments:

    INPUTFILE -> CDF

    OUTPUTFILE -> SOURCE

    PROTOSFILE -> PROTO

    INTERNAL

    EXTERNAL

    GUI

  and made it usable from the Workbench since it now has a GUI.



Version 1.2     Completed: 24-Oct-93

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added code to handle the headers for external catalogs.

- Created code for external catalogs.

- Can now handle (//) prefs structs.

  (id#/min chars/max chars)

- Got rid of StatusBox() and now use MyEasyRequest() for ALL messages.

- Changed GUI to OPENEDITOR.

- The program now detaches from the Shell only if OPENEDITOR is specified since

  it needs to print some messages in the Shell if not using the editor.

- If an error is encountered while making a catalog file, it returns

  RETURN_ERROR to stop SMake from continuing.

- Create GadTools.c and all support routines (total of 4 modules!) for complete

  locale string and font size sensitivity.

- Added information box



Version 1.3     Completed: 22-Mar-94

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- After specifing a CDF name, it is automatically scanned to get the info.

- Updated filerequester with better patterns, automatically goes to correct

  language directory for external catalogs.

- Added INFO to show catalog info if used in the Shell.  Can also use it to show

  the info without making a catalog.

- Created Asl.c.  Updated GetFile().

- Fixed memory loss problem with the filehandles.

- Updated command line argument help.

- Fixed another memory loss problem after the CDF was scanned.

- Changed from SAS/C's fopen(), fgets(), fputs(), and fclose() to DOS library's

  Open(), FPuts(), FGets(), and Close().  This shrank the code and made it more

  compatible with SegmentSplitter().

- Added NODETACH/S to prevent detaching from the Shell window.  This is needed

  if OPENEDITOR is not specified and using it in a script, like in SMakefiles,

  if you wish to edit multiple catalogs using the file requester.



Version 1.4     Completed: 03-Apr-94

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Created StringsSupport.c for added error detection.  It now checks for

  duplicate identifiers and ID numbers.  It checks for correct backslash

  control seqeunces.  It then does FinalizeString() to make it totally correct

  for internal/external catalogs.

- Finally got it to correctly write external catalogs.  It took me awhile and

  had to ask many questions, but I got it!

- Update StringsSupport.c.  Split CheckString() into a seperate routine that

  calls other checking routines.

- Updated code to extract the preferences from (//).  It had a few bugs in it

  that came up with beta testing the new StringsSupport.c routines.

- Added the option to create output for either Assembly or C code.  Choose via a

  MX_KIND gadget next to catalog type MX_KIND gadget.

- Added command line arguments ASM/S and C/S to go with the above.

- Updated and added some new error checkers:

    · Duplicate identifier and ID checkers.

    · Min and Max line length checkers.

    · No string defined.

    · String must be x characters long.

    · More string expected after \

      line continuation flag.

- Updated CheckString() to report the correct line number if an error occurs

  in a multi-line string.

- Added NOUNDEFINEDS/S argument to warn if a string is undefined.  By default

  undefineds are allowed; the argument enables the warning message.



Version 1.5     Completed: 23.10.94

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Finally decided on a name for this program: Universal Translator.

- Updated CheckLength() to better handle strings that must be a certain length,

  (/15/15).

- Updated some error messages to be more specific about the error.

- Fixed a potentially huge bug that would have made this program a laughing

  stock if not found and fixed before I released it.  It was a for(...) loop

  that would have aborted reading long CDFs with more than 2000 actual lines,

  not strings.

- Lines longer than 200 characters will bring up a requester saying that it

  needs to be split into shorter strings.  This is best since it is easy to

  mess up translations with many backslash sequences, and it may not fit on

  the line after it is translated.

- Created a new way to make the _Blank.cd file.  It now reads the CDF and

  copies it over line by line.  This is better because it will also copy all

  comments and doesn't require AppPref[] anymore.

- Created a Preferences menu to toggle "No Undefineds".  This will allow for

  future expansion of options as they arise since they will not fit on a

  640x200 screen.

- The file requester patterns now reflect the language type.

- Fixed a bug in the line continuation code.  It now also accurately reports

  which line the error actually occured on (the last \), not the next MSG_

  line.

- Moved the catalog type and language output into the Preferences menu.

  Only C is active in Output Language.

                                       Oberon

- Created a prefs file using Configurations.c.  Added menu items to load and

  save the prefs file.  The command line arguments override the saved settings.

- Added argument NOVERSION to not display program title and version string.

  Useful for SMakefiles.

- Moved all the headers into a seperate file, WriteHeaders.c, to clear up

  MyProgram.c.  Since there were so many lines in MyProgram.c, it would not

  optimize, but it will now with them cleared out.

- Changed: OPENENDITOR -> DONOTOPENEDITOR -> NOUI

- Several bug fixes and code updates.

- Wrote AmigaGuide.



Version 1.6     Completed: 3.5.95

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Now Kickstart 3.0 minimum.

- Updated to use gtlayout.library.

- Updated to use Modules directory.

- Added Iconify in Project menu.

- Updated AmigaGuide.

- Split MyProgram.c into multiple files to handle catalogs for each type and

  each language.

- Fixed a little bug that sometimes caused a guru when free'ing memory.

- Updated the entire program to use Exec lists instead of an array.  Allows

  for catalogs as large as available memory; no limitations.

- Added another string preferences check.

- Updated scanner to only scan CDF once and keep strings in memory.  It used

  to scan, display, then free.  It would then have to scan again when make

  catalog files.

- Wrote code for E language output.  Hopefully it is correct; copied the code

  from a program I found on a BBS.

- Took out C++.

- Added Icon_X and Icon_Y arguments to place AppIcon where the user wants it.

- Assembly in now divided into 2 specific assemblers: Aztec and SAS.  Also put

  C++ support back in.

- Changed NoUndefineds to AllowUndefineds.  Updated ArgumentParser() to handle

  the new method:  UNDEFINEDS=TRUE or FALSE

- Only C and C++ can use the Prototype file so it is now only enabled when

  C or C++ output language is selected.

- Added command line argument [LANGUAGE <language>] to specify a preferred

  language for locale strings.

- Fixed a little bug with Close(Handle->iff_Stream).  Had to ...=NULL to prevent

  a guru.

- Added     Tab Size------->1       to Preferences menu

                            2

                            4

                            8

  to specify preferred tab size for output code.

- Split alot of set up and shut down code into a seperate file,

  MyProgramSupport.c to speep up compilation and easier updating.

- Removed alot of extraneous code that I no longer needed or I overlooked in

  gtlayout.library.

- Updated routine to start iconified.

- Exec lists updates.

- Finally finished the Assembly string writing routines.

- Updated AmigaGuide.

- Public release.
