Man is a program like... Man :)), used on UN*X workstations to gain some
help about system calls and commands on the shell.

When I try other versions of this useful command, I am not satisfied for
results, so, I write my own version.

This is a program written after opening and closing with Multiview(tm) the
AutoDocs(tm) for every Amiga system call needed for programming, so I think
it will be useful for a quick look about one of them. It's probably faster
use my program instead of searching manually for parameters of that system
call.

Of course there are programmers who remember every system call of the Amiga
Kernel, but for normal peoples, like me :)), Man will do its job.

To run Man you need :

    @{b}o@{ub} AmigaOS v3.0 or higher
    @{b}o@{ub} Motorola 68020
    @{b}o@{ub} Original AutoDocs files
    @{b}o@{ub} Hard Disk is recommended, or you will wait..wait..wait....

@node INSTALLATION "Man.guide/Installation"
@next USAGE
@prev REQUIREMENTS

Man must be installed manually, because it's very simple and I generally
don't use Installer(tm) ;).

Follow the steps below.

    @{b}o@{ub} Copy the executable file to C: or another desired location.
    @{b}o@{ub} Copy this documentation where you want.
    @{b}o@{ub} Assign MAN: to a directory containing the Autodocs(tm) files.
               You can use multiple assigns, if your docs are in various
               directories.
               Try this :

               Assign MAN: dir1 dir2 dir3 etc.

    @{b}o@{ub} Relax yourself. All done :)

Man has this syntax :

    Man <SystemCall> [ALL]

where :

  @{b}SystemCall@{ub} is the (partial, see later) name of system call you
                      are searching. It is no case-sensitive, so, if you
                      don't remember if the call is Forbid() or ForBid() or
                      fORBID() :)), there are no problems.

  @{b}ALL@{ub}        is optional and tells Man not to stop if it founds a
                      system call name containing string passed like first
                      argument. If you want infos about calls with string
                      "Init",using ALL, you will gain infos of InitCLI(),
                      InitBitMap() etc, otherwise Man will show infos only
                      for first system call (ie. only InitCLI()) and no more.

Use CTRL+C to stop it.


 Examples :

You want see infos about Forbid():

1> Man Forbid

will show only Forbid().

You want see infos about BltBitMap* :

1> Man BltBitMap ALL

will show BltBitMap(), BltBitMapRastPort() etc.

 None (I hope).

 Man is tested with my configuration below and never gave me some problem.

 @{b}o@{ub} A1200
 @{b}o@{ub} CPU Motorola 68EC020 14 Mhz
 @{b}o@{ub} FPU Motorola 68881   14 Mhz
 @{b}o@{ub} Microbotics MBX1200z with 8 MB Fast Ram on board
 @{b}o@{ub} Hard Disk 540 MB (IBM)

 I successfully tested Man on AutoDocs(tm) files and files released with
 some C compiler.

 The format of files MUST be this :


 <FORMFEED>                      [RETURN here is optional]
 xxxxx.library/yyyyyzzzz()       name of system call
 infos....


 FormFeed is usually printed like an inverted L symbol and has ASCII code 12.

 If you are sure that Man has a bug, then @{"contact me" link CONTACT} so
 I can remove it (I hope :))
