This source code requires the GMS developer archive from Aminet
(dev/misc/gms_dev.lha).  Compilation of this module means that you have
read and agreed to the text in the DISTRIBUTION.TXT file.

NOTE:  There is a bug in SAS/C which occurs when using registers a0 and a1
together in a function.  This only happens when both registers are using a
pointer type, such as BYTE *, APTR or struct Object *.  So if you see such
definitions being replaced with LONGs and then being converted inside the
function, it is done specifically to prevent this bug.

To compile every part of the module with SAS/C:

  1> sc colours_data.c   <Compile the data area>
  1> sc colours.c        <Compile the code>
  1> link.scr            <Link it>

To compile with DiceC:

  1> dcc -c -l0 -mD -mi colours.c -o colours.o
  1> dcc -c -l0 -mD -mi colours_data.c -o colours_data.o
  1> dlink colours_data.o colours.o -o GMS:System/colours.mod

If the dpkernel.library is resident after compilation (eg you have run
some programs beforehand) then you will need to do a "flush
dpkernel.library" so that the module will be reloaded the next time you run
something.
