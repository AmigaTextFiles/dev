1. Introduction
===============

PHN-MapEdit is a tool for editing the block-map of multidirectional
scrolling games. It supports 16x16 pixel blocks up to 32 colors. The
map dimensions are unlimited and depend on your available memory only.
MapEdit reads and writes raw map files with each byte representing a
16x16 block of your map. Hence the number of different block images,
defined by an IFF-ILBM file, is limited to 256.

MapEdit was written in C with extensive usage of "game.lib" (© 1992
by Frank Wille). Because of the nature of game.lib, which was mainly
designed for games, the user interface is not very style-guide con-
form, but the program supports all OS versions, CPUs and custom chips
(but no gfx-cards).  Multitasking is not disabled, but the system's
copper lists, so you can't bring the WB screen to front while editing.

============

PHN-MapEdit is FREEWARE!



3. Installation
===============

To run PHN-MapEdit you may copy the three files

PHN-MapEdit
mapedit7.fnt
cursor.spr

whereever you want.



4. Using MapEdit
================

To start with editing, you need at least a block image file, in the form
of an IFF-ILBM picture. The picture dimensions are absolutely irrelevant.
Gaps between the block images are allowed, but a row of blocks must not
end with a partial block. If the block doesn't fit into the current row,
put it into the next one. You may refer to "blkimgs.iff" as an example.

The map file has the raw format:  UBYTE map[HEIGHT][WIDTH];


4.1. A sample session
---------------------

Warning: Don't expect a comfortable file requester, you will be forced
	 to remember the needed file names... ;)

The following steps are required, to edit the example map:

1. Start PHN-MapEdit.

2. You will be asked to enter the map dimensions. Enter:
   WIDTH:  120
   HEIGHT: 120

3. Now MapEdit requires the names of the map and the block image file:
   MAP FILE NAME:   examplemap.120.120
   ILBM FILE NAME:  blkimgs.iff

4. NUMBER OF IMAGES: 220
   This is the number of block images, which will be used by the editor.
   It is allowed to specify more than your picture actually contains -
   then you will get some empty blocks additionally.

5. IMAGE GAP:	     1
   The gap between the block images (horizontal and vertical) is one
   pixel in this case. 'freditor' images use a zero gap, for example.

6. Now the files will be read and checked. Hit a key to start with
   editing...


4.2. Editor functions
---------------------

Mouse control:

o Move the mouse without pressing a button to move the cursor
o Pressing the left mouse button plots the currently selected block
  into the map
o Holding the right mouse button by moving the mouse left or right
  lets you select another block image

Keyboard:

Esc - Exit the program without saving. No security check!
F1 - Saves your map file. The program continues.
F6 - Init map. The whole map is initialized with your current block
     image.
F7 - Standard fill. All blocks which have the same image and have a
     connection with the block under your cursor are replaced by the
     current block image.
F8 - Quad fill. Same as above, but four preselected (F10) block images
     will be used for filling.
F10 - Quad fill preselect. You will be prompted for four block images,
      which will be used in quad fill (F8). They are arranged as
      follows, when filling:
       ---------------
      | first | second|
      |       |       |
       ---------------
      | third | fourth|
      |       |       |
       ------- -------
SPACE - Overview. Computes an overview map with the size 1:8. It will
	also inform you about the current cursor coordinates.
