Changes from v1.4

 29-06-99  - Added a "Are you Sure" requester to the "Universal
             Configuration" menu.
 
 18-06-99  - The minimum window width has been reduced to approx.
             halfe of the original width. When using tiny screen
             resolutions like PAL:640x256, many peple had problems
             placing windows in a plesant manner.

 18-06-99  - An error while selecting "New" from the project menu
             has been eliminated. It did ghost the "Add Group..."
             function as well.


Changes from v1.33

 04-06-99  - A simple search for string added to the function text.

 01-06-99  - Minor bug removed when resizing function window without a
             function selected.

 05-05-99  - An iconify feature has been added after many requestes from
             you guys :-)
 09-04-99  - Yet another font bug removed from load config routine...


Changes from v1.31

 02.04.99  - A minor bug reported from Jean-François Fabre has been removed.
             While having only one group added to the list and rerunning
             AutodocViewer, a DosError requester would appear.
             Even though no autodocs where added, AutodocViewer did try to
             access one. Thanx Jean :-)

 31.03.99  - Many people have pointed out the underscore in requesters,
             I did assume that rtpatch where used heavly out there, but
             I was wrong... All underscores in rtpatched requesters
             has been removed...


Changes from v1.3

 27.03.99  - The configuration and prefs file has been moved to the PROGDIR:
             instead of S: requested by several people. The install script
             will ask you if you want to copy existing files

 27.03.99  - A minor "Work up" in the function window when  it's
             empty and resized has been eliminated. Reported by Michael Malyshev
