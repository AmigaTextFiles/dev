AutodocViewer v1.41  Copyright © 1994-1999 by Ronny Tennebekk

AutodocViewer is a smart piece of code which enabled
you to access your autodocs fast and effeciently, and 
with a standard intuitive and highly configurable
interface.

Changes made in this version

 - Added a "Are you Sure" requester to the "Universal
   Configuration" menu.
 
 - The minimum window width has been reduced to approx.
   halfe of the original width. When using tiny screen
   resolutions like PAL:640x256, many peple had problems
   placing windows in a plesant manner.

 - An error while selecting "New" from the project menu
   has been eliminated. It did ghost the "Add Group..."
   function as well.

AutodocViewer is surely amied at all developers out there
looking for an easy way to lookup the information found
in the CBM's autodocs files and other libraries like MUI,
Picasso96 etc.
