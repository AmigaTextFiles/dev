    NAME
	HLSysInfo - obtain information regarding the hotlinks system.

    SYNOPSIS
	error = HLSysInfo(handle, array)
	 d0              d0      d1

	int HLSysInfo(ULONG, int *);

    FUNCTION
        Will fill array with useful information like memory used, number of 
        editions, etc. The exact information to be returned has not been
        decided yet.
        
        This routine is not yet implemented so it will return UNIMPLEMENTED.

    INPUTS
        handle - the hotlinks 'handle' as returned by HLRegister.
        
        array - an array of long words that will be filled in by the routine.
                The exact format of this array has not been decided yet, other
                than to say that it will be an array of long words. But exactly
                how many entries are needed and what they each stand for has
                yet to be determined.

    RESULTS
        Will fill in the array with information about the hotlinks system.
        
        Possible information includes:                
                user name
                hotlinks resident code version number
                number of local editions

        ULONG HLRegister(int, struct @{"MsgPort" Link "exec/ports.h/Main" 29} *, struct @{"Screen" Link "intuition/screens.h/Main" 97} *);

    FUNCTION
        Program must make this call to register themselves with HotLinks 
        prior to making any calls to hotlinks.
        
        Handle must be freed before the registered program exits or memory
        will be lost.

    INPUTS
        id - a four byte id to be used for as the creator id of any editions
           that this application may create.
           
        msgport - a pointer to a standard exec message port. This port is used
           to send Notify messages to the application when an edition changes. 
           This may be NULL, if the application never calls @{"Notify()" Link "Notify()"} to set up 
           a notify on an edition.
           
        screen - a pointer to a valid screen where to application wants
           hotlinks to open up it's requester on. If this argument is NULL
           the default public screen is chosen (which is normally Workbench).

    RESULTS
        handle - a handle to be maintained throughout the duration of the
           registered application.  This must be freed by calling @{"UnRegister()" Link "UnRegister()"}
           before the application exits or memory will be lost.
           
        INVPARAM - ?
        NOMEMORY - there was not enough memory to perform this function.

    FUNCTION
        This function will allocate a struct @{"PubBlock" Link "hotlinks/hotlinks.h/Main" 278} and initialize it.
        This is the preferred method of allocating a @{"PubBlock" Link "hotlinks/hotlinks.h/Main" 278} structure because
        if the size of the @{"PubBlock" Link "hotlinks/hotlinks.h/Main" 278} structure changes your program will not
        have to be changed to work properly.

        This works much like the dos.library Examine call in that it sets
        up for a series os @{"NextPub()" Link "NextPub()"} calls to look at all the editions the
        current user can gain access to.

    INPUTS
        pblock - pointer to a valid @{"PubBlock" Link "hotlinks/hotlinks.h/Main" 278} as returned by @{"AllocPBlock()" Link "AllocPBlock()"}.

    FUNCTION
        This will cause a notify to be set up on the pblock. Anytime the

        This function will allow you to lock other applications out from being
        able to modify the edition file until you unlock it.
        
        This is a 'soft' lock in that it is only in effect while the hotlinks
        resident code is active. If the computer is turned off, all locks
        are lost.

    INPUTS
        pblock - must be a valid PubBLock.
        flags - 
            LOCK_RELEASE - will release the previously held lock.
            LOCK_READ - locks the edition file for reading. This is not an 
                exclusive lock. So other applications can also gain read
                access to this file.
            LOCK_WRITE - locks the edition file for writing. This is an 
                exclusive lock. No other application can get a lock on the
                edition file until the lock is released.

    RESULTS
        NOERROR - got the lock with no problems.
        INVPARAM - a invalid parameter was passed to the function.
        INUSE - the edition file is locked by some one else.
        NOPRIV - the currently logged in user does not have access to the
           edition file asked for.
        CHANGED - ?

            If pblock->PRec.ID[0] and [1] are 0, this means that a new edition
            file should be created. Call with the following parameters in 
            @{"PubBlock" Link "hotlinks/hotlinks.h/Main" 278} filled in: 
            Type, Access, Name, Desc, Creator.
        flags - 
            OPEN_READ - opens the edition file for reading.
            OPEN_WRITE - opens the edition file for writing.

    RESULTS
        NOERROR - the pblock is filled in with the latest information
        NOMEMORY - not enough memory to carry out the open.
        INVPARAM - either the pblock was NULL or had invalid information in it,
           or the flags were incorrect.

        GetPub - presents an edition requester (much like a file requester).
    
    SYNOPSIS
        error = GetPub(pblock, filterproc)
         d0              d0        d1

        int GetPub(struct @{"PubBlock" Link "hotlinks/hotlinks.h/Main" 278} *, int (*)());

    FUNCTION
        Presents the user with an edition requester. This functions much like
        a file requester except it only shows hotlinks edition files.
        
        The requester will be opened on the screen specified in the 
        @{"HLRegister()" Link "HLRegister()"} call.
        
        Only the editions available to the currently logged in user will be
        shown in the requester.
                
    INPUTS
        pblock - must be a valid pblock.
        filterproc - a pointer to a procedure that returns an integer in d0.
            The filterproc is called with a pointer to a @{"PubBlock" Link "hotlinks/hotlinks.h/Main" 278} in a0. This
            allows the calling application to display only the editions in the
            edition requester it wants to. It can decide if the edition should
            be displayed by examining the @{"PubBlock" Link "hotlinks/hotlinks.h/Main" 278} (passed in a0) and returning
            ACCEPT or NOACCEPT in d0. This is useful if the application only
            handles one type of edition file (ILBM, DTXT, etc.). If this
            argument is NULL, then all editions will be shown.

    RESULTS
        on return - the pblock is filled in with the information for the
           edition the user selected.
           
        NOERROR - the data in the pblock is valid for the selected edition.

        The requester will be opened on the screen specified in the 
        @{"HLRegister()" Link "HLRegister()"} call.
        
        Note that this does not create the edition file, the application must
        still call @{"OpenPub()" Link "OpenPub()"} with the ID set to 0 for the edition to be 
        created.
        
    INPUTS
        pblock - must be a valid pblock returned by @{"AllocPBlock()" Link "AllocPBlock()"}. The
           pblock->PRec.Name, pblock->PRec.Description, and 
           pblock->PRec.Access will be shown to the user when the requester
           opens. This is used for the application to give some default
           values.
        filterproc - This argument is not utilized at this time and may be
           set to NULL.

    RESULTS
        NOERROR - no problem.
