This file contains the library "stubs" for use with a compiler that does not
support the #pragma pre-processor statement.

To use this file, it must be linked with your code with the other 
"linker libraries" such as amiga.lib.

example:

        blink FROM test.o LIB lib:amiga.lib lib:hlstub.o TO test

This will cause only the modules referenced by test.o to be linked in to your
final code.
