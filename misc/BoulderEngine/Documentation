Hello friends,

Here is my first and last experiments with "C" and Amiga. I used A500 with
1.3 and 2.04 kick. After some time I get A1200 and made some changes to
included programs. I never released this files to public. It was only
internal use programs written without ANY DOCUMENTATION. I debuged some
example programs and wrote Boulder Dash program for my Amiga. This programs
were written in 1995. In this times I didn't know anything about Internet
nor Aminet. And more, I was ashamed to place this programs in public. I
thought that they are bad. Amateur programming, lots of errors...
Then I forgot this disk...

After some time I got Golden Games CD. I found that my program is not the
worst. Also I DL some Amiga Boulder Dash clones from Aminet. They are slow
and I can't feel the spirit of Boulder Dash in that programs...

So I decided to put my version of program and ALL the sources in "C".

I was using old Aztec C compiler. My program is not using tricky routines,
so you can easy convert to some new compiler.

Known bugs:

1. Game didn't want to exit properly. Some problems in freeing mem.
2. Game is not using timer (I didn't know how) for timing, so on speedy
Amigas it is extremelly quick!!!
3. Sound is crap.

I included few versions. Some work good on old OCS/ECS Amiga. Other work on
my A1200 with 68030 @ 50MHz :)

Now I'll try to comment my source files. Sorry, original comments are in
Lithuanian language. (Rare one?)

//////BOULDER.C////////

The main thing for begginer is main loop program [analize(x,y)] It is
program which scans and calculates objects in game field and [Play()]-row and
collumn counter.

some dictionary:
q==15) /* Judanti Siena */ -moving wall
q==17) /* Dzin-Dzin Siena */ magic wall which convers rocks to diamonds
q==16) /* Neauganti magma */ not moving "magma?"
q==18) /* Akmenu generatorius */ Rock generator
q==19) /* Bril. generatorius */ Diamond generator
q==23) {BigSuck(x,y,c2,c3); -Black hole in universe. Dangerous thing...

Some Rocks are Bombs and they detonate....

///////BOULDER0.C//////
Init routines. I draw my game images with Drawline command? (I was crazy...)

///////BOULDER2.C//////
Intro page.

///////BOULDER3.C//////
Joystic procedures. And some "magma" routines.

///////CAVES.C//////
The caves are hardcoded here!

I think it is easy to understand it.

//////////MUSIC.C
and
/////////MUSICKERNEL.C

Music routines. Bad ones.
