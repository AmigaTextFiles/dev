Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a little (676 bytes) program that I wrote because I needed to
allocate memory, so that the memory would not be overwritten by other
programs.
To be more specific, I was decrunching old demos/intros that was
crunched with some absolute-address crunchers (like TetraPacker etc.).

The program is for OS2.0 and up only, and must be started from CLI/Shell.
To start the program, enter 'Allocate' followed by the address to the
beginning of the memory block to allocate and the size of the block in
bytes entered in hex.

Example:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Allocate 1FE000 1FFF

This will allocate the memory from $1fe000 to $1fffff.
The '$' sign must not be used.

I'll quit here, because I'm too lazy to write big documents, and I don't
want to put more effort into the documents than to the program...
