@TITLE "AttrMan - Introduction"

   AttrMan
   ~~~~~~~
   AttrMan adds virtual attribute values to code supporting AttrMan.
   Why? I hear you ask, well because there are coming more and more programs
   using attributes and other values which !could! collide with each other
   if they aren't chosen in a good fashion. The MUI system asks MUI programmers
   to use their registration number but what if you can't simply afford to
   register or when the registration numbers run out. Well that is where AttrMan
   comes in, an AttrMan supporting application simply asks AttrMan space for n
   values AttrMan checks its lists and returns a value range which isn't in use
   yet, the next code does so too and so on. This way all these code can't collide
   with each other. I know one thing for sure and that is when everybody is going
   to pick random values on their own their are going to be a lots of incompatible
   software altough they don't do anything wrong.

@NODE "INTRO_SYSREQ" "AttrMan.guide/INTRO_SYSREQ"
@TITLE "AttrMan - System Requirements"

   System Requirements
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   You'll need an Amiga equipped with Amiga OS Release 2 or up+ (v36+) this
   is because I used some OS2 calls. Anyway attributes,tags etc where introduced
   in OS2 and you can get very cheap upgrade roms nowadays so that shouldn't be
   much of a problem. Memory should not be a problem as AttrMan uses very little
   to none to store it's information.


@ENDNODE

@NODE "INTRO_USE" "AttrMan.guide/INTRO_USE"
@TITLE "AttrMan - Installation"

   Installation
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Copy the program called 'AttrMan' to your c: directory and add the
   following 3 lines to your s:startup-sequence preferably right after
   the Setpatch command :

   ;BEGIN AttrMan
   run <>NIL: c:AttrMan
   ;END AttrMan

   These lines will run AttrMan as a background task. AttrMan will
   setup a semaphore which then can be accessed by any program.
   You should place the above lines as close to setpatch to ensure
   that any program needing AttrMan can find the AttrMan semaphore.

   You can break AttrMan by sending it a CTRL-C by simply using
   status and then using break <no> where <no> is the cli-number
   AttrMan is running under. eg:

   8> status
   Process 1: Loaded as command: attrman
   Process 2: Loaded as command: c:Enforcer
   Process 3: Loaded as command: sushi
   Process 4: Loaded as command: Workbench
   Process 5: Loaded as command: Utils:AntiVirus/VC/Virus_Checker
   Process 6: Loaded as command: src:c/Cosmetic
   Process 7: Loaded as command: SnakeMenu
   Process 8: Loaded as command: status
   8> break 1
   8> status
   Process 2: Loaded as command: c:Enforcer
   Process 3: Loaded as command: sushi
   Process 4: Loaded as command: Workbench
   Process 5: Loaded as command: Utils:AntiVirus/VC/Virus_Checker
   Process 6: Loaded as command: src:c/Cosmetic
   Process 7: Loaded as command: SnakeMenu
   Process 8: Loaded as command: status
   8>

   Notez-bien that when some programs still have allocations standing
   out that AttrMan cannot go away and will still stay alive until
   all programs using AttrMan are gone. When there are still programs
   using AttrMan, it will output the names of these programs. But as
   you used <>NIL: these won't be seen so you should use the supplied
   program called @{" AM_Info " Link "SUP_AMINFO"} (which source is included in this package):

   The programnames you find when either reading the output from AttrMan
   or AM_Info should be searched for and then terminated after they are gone
   you should try to break AttrMan which then should break properly.

   Options
   ~~~~~~~
   The following options should only be used when you know what you
   are doing. All the options are parsed with ReadArgs() with the
   following template:

   "AS=AttrStart/K,CS=ChunkSize/K"

   where

   AttrStart    = Start of the values in hex (defaults to TAG_USER=$80000000).
   ChunkSize    = Size of an allocation hunk (will be used in future version).

   eg.

   AttrMan AS=90000000 CS=32
   would set the AttributeStart at 90000000 and the chunksize to 32.

@TITLE "AttrMan - Using AttrMan in your code"

   Using AttrMan in your code
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   If you want to build-in AttrMan support in your programs you should
   change the following things in your programs :

    - All attribute&tag values should have a base of 0, the best way
      to do this is to use an enum starting with 0.
    - Allocate the values at the start of your program by counting
      all the values and passing them to lock->AllocAttr().
      This is done the best way by adding a LAST_NUMBER enum at the
      end of your enumeration and using that.
    - Allocate only the values you need, multiple allocations can
      also be done.
    - Make sure user programs can get your AttrStart value, you could
           Libraries: - special LVO.
                      - put the value in your base and make it public.
           Classes:   - Use the V42 ClassBase at the start of your own
                        classbase and add the attribut from AttrMan.h
                        which returns your class base.
                      - put the value in your base and make it public.
           All:       - Make your name public in an include file and let
                        the user search the value when you can't use any
                        of the above methods.
     - Convert any attribute/tag value to make use of AttrMan.
     - When you receive an attribute simply substract the start and compare
       it with your enumerations.
     - On OM_NEW users could use NewObject(...,...,CLASS_Stuff+start,Stuff,TAG_END);

   Updates
   ~~~~~~~
   Whenever a new release of AttrMan gets released, I will post some
   information in the appropriate newsgroups of some electronic networks.
   The new archive will soon be available on many bulletin boards and on
   all `AmiNet' FTP servers. You will be able to find AttrMan on the Aminet
   in dev/misc.

   Future
   ~~~~~~
   I hope that AttrMan is implemented into the AmigaOS probably
   in utility.library, because when the total OS uses this system
   no programs can collide with each other. Futher I will update
   this program when somebody finds any bugs and I'll help anybody
   with implementing support into his/hers program(s). If you've
   got any suggestions then send them to me!
   (see  @{" Support " Link "MISC_SUPPORT"} how to reach the me).

@NODE "SUP_AMINFO" "AttrMan.guide/SUP_AMINFO"
@TITLE "AttrMan - Am_Info"

   AM_Info
   ~~~~~~~
   AM_Info shows information about the running AttrMan.

   AM_Info has an output somewhat similar like this:

   8> AM_Info
   @{B}AM_Info 1.0/36.0@{UB} ©1996 @{FG Fill}Jeroen Massar@{FG Text}
   This system is using : AttrMan 1.0/36.1 (28.07.96) by Jeroen Massar
                          Global AttrStart: 0x80000000, ChunkSize: 32
   The following 2 users are currently using AttrMan:
   +------+--------------------------------+------------+------------+
   |  No  |              Name              |   Start    |    Size    |
   +------+--------------------------------+------------+------------+
   |    1 | group.class                    | 0x80000000 |        100 |
   |    2 | utilitypatcher                 | 0x80000064 |         12 |
   +------+--------------------------------+------------+------------+

   The first line shows info about AM_Info itself.
   The second line shows the release,version,date and the name of the coder
   of the running copy of AttrMan.
   The third line shows the number of users and the chunksize.
   The following lines show a table containing the name,startvalue and size
   of the area allocated. When AM_Info complains that it couldn't find
   AttrMan simply run it by typing c:AttrMan (that is if you installed it there).
