LEDA example programs
+++++++++++++++++++++

I did compile the examples for the high distribution, but because
of the archives size, they will be distributed seperately:

	LEDA-examples-high.lha
	LEDA-x11-examples-high.lha

I did divide the example package in two parts, because most amiga
users don't have X11 (DaggeX 1.0b) installed.
