--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Behavior differences between the functions of GTE.lib & gadtools 34.1
  and those of the true gadtools 37 (remove the EF_ prefix if you refer
  to gadtools.library 34.1, leave it if you refer instead to GTE.lib).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


EF_CreateGadgetA(CYCLE_KIND,...):
  The inner text (that of the labels) of these gadgets doesn't change
   its color when the gadget is in HIGHLIGHTED state but instead it stays
   of the TEXTPEN color.
   This goes unnoticed if the TEXTPEN and FILLTEXTPEN colors are the same.

EF_CreateGadgetA(MX_KIND,...):
  This gadget kind, unlike gadtools, doesn't (yet) support the underscore
   for each label.
  The (obsolete) tag LAYOUTA_Spacing isn't supported. Use, as the RKM
   also recommends, the new tag GTMX_Spacing.

EF_CreateGadgetA(STRING_KIND,...):
EF_CreateGadgetA(INTEGER_KIND,...):
  The tags GA_TabCycle and STRINGA_ExitHelp aren't supported, and probably
   they will never be, as these are features of intuition V37 and not of
   gadtools.

EF_CreateGadgetA(TEXT_KIND,...):
EF_CreateGadgetA(NUMBER_KIND,...):
  The gadget of this kind always cut the text if this is larger than the
   gadget, while gadtools doesn't do that if the gadget hasn't a border.

EF_LayoutMenuItemsA(...):
  The placing of the menu item and sub-item isn't always identical to
   what gadtools would do, but it's not easy to discover the exact criteria
   gadtools uses just by making experimental observations.
  The displacement and columnizing of the menu item, to do in the case of
   insufficient space (screen too narrow or too shorter) aren't (yet)
   supported.

                              FIXED PROBLEMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

EF_CreateGadgetA(ALL_KINDS,...):
  The tag GT_Underscore is supported but it produces an underscore
   character placed lower than that produced by gadtools.
   That is because GTE.lib superimposes a true underscore character to
   the text, while gadtools probably adds an image or a border under the
   character to be underlined. (?!?, N. o. A.)
   It's not, however, a relevant problem and it goes almost unnoticed if
   the used font is topaz 8.
 > Solution: Now it superimposes to the text a character that is the same
   as that to be underlined, with in addition the FSF_UNDERLINED style
   (exactly what gadtools does).

EF_CreateGadgetA(PALETTE_KIND,...):
  If the tag GTPA_ColorOffset has a value different than zero, the color
   gadgets shifted to the end of the list will return, if selected, the
   value corresponding to their actual color, and not, like with gadtools,
   the ordinal numeric value corresponding to their position in the list
   (all this in the Code field).
 > Solution: Banal. Now it behaves as gadtools, also because the behavior
   of gadtools in this case isn't casual at all, but instead it follows a
   well-defined logic and furthermore it is described by the official
   documentation (AMIGA ROM Kernel Reference Manual: Libraries).

EF_CreateGadgetA(CYCLE_KIND,...):
  With very large fonts (compared to the gadget's size) the text could
   not be vertically centered with the same precision as gadtools [but
   it isn't certain at all that really happens].
 > Solution: Indeed it doesn't happen.
