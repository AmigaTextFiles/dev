DrawList parameters
-------------------

The drawlist keyword does not produce a gadget. It creates an image to be used later. Up to 50 images can be predefined, the last one defined is the first one used. Last In First Out.

bindata (bd)

The drawlistdata will be passed to this pipe in binary after the command line. The drawlistdata parameter now gives the length of the data. Setting datain means the data is read from an external file rather than the pipe.

dataout="filename" (do=)

 Send the data for this gadget to a file. This is a development tool to allow you to create binary data to pass to the pipe. It is ignored if the Bindata keyword is also present.

datain="filename" (di=)

 Read the data for this gadget from a file. It is ignored if the Bindata keyword is not present.

minheight=number (minh)

 Set the height of the virtual raster the drawlist data
relates to.

minwidth=number (minw)

 Set the width of the virtual raster the drawlist data relates
to.

drawlistdata="value1|value2|..."   (dld=)

 The draw list data defines a set of drawing instruction to create an image. Each drawing instruction has 6 values.
directive|X1|Y1|X2|Y2|pen

The possible directives are

0 END
1 LINE
2 RECT
3 FILL
4 ELLIPSE
5 CIRCLE
6 LINEPAT
7 FILLPAT
8 AMOVE
9 ADRAW
10 AFILL
11 BEVELBOX
12 ARC
13 START = BOUNDS
14 LINESIZE

Register as a Class Act developer and read the docs for more info on drawlists.

When sending binary data you send an array of structure DrawLists.

struct DrawList
            {
                WORD dl_Directive;
                WORD dl_X1, dl_Y1;
                WORD dl_X2, dl_Y2;
                WORD dl_Pen;
            };
The last structure MUST be END (dl_Directive=0).

Definition Reply
-----------------

 When the image creation is successful the pipe replies with

'ok'
