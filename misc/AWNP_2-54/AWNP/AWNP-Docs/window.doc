The parameters defining the CA window must all be on one line terminated by a newline. The pipe will reply with 'window ok'.


screentitle="screen title text"  (st=)

 Set the text for the screen title when CA window is active.

title="window title text"

 Set the title for the CA window.

pubscreen="Screen name"  (ps=)

 Open the CA window on a public screen

IconifyIcon (ii=)

Set the name of the icon to use when you iconify the window.

IconTitle="icon title text"  (it=)

 Set the title for the CA window when iconified.

backfill="filename"  (bf=)

 Image file to use as backfill for window. If backfill is not specified you get the default window backfill. Setting backfill="" can be used to have no backfill at all. Use this carefully as it overrides the user CA prefs.

NoBorder (NB)

 Make the window borderless.

Quiet  (q)

 Tell the pipe not to reply to the window, gadget definitions, or modify commands. This is actually a toggle switch turning replies off and on. SOME modify commands are ALWAYS replied to. (addnode and getfile selected 0|1)

NoWindow

 switch to causes no window to be opened. This will not work unless modify is set and an arexx object is defined.

NOTE: At times you may want to modify a GUI after is is created, but BEFORE the window is opened. Use the 'NoWindow' keyword in the window definition, create the GUI as usual. When you send 'open' the window does NOT open but you do go into modify mode. Modify the GUI then send 'id 0 s 64' to open the window after it has been modified.

app

 Make  this  window a application window.

activate  (a)

 Switch to activate theCA window when it opens.

depthgadget (dg)

 Switch to include a depth gadget on the CA window.

dragbar  (db)

 Switch to include a drag bar on the CA window.

closegadget (cg)

 Switch to include a close gadget on the CA window.

askclose

 Switch to stop the close gadget from actually closing the window. The close gadget will generate an 'askclose' event instead. This switch is ignored unless modify is also set.

sizegadget (sg)

 Switch to include a window size gadget on the CA window.

iconifygadget  (ig)

 Switch to include an iconify gadget on the CA window.

fullscreen    (fs)
centerscreen   (cs)
topleft         (tl)

 Relative position to open the CA window at. Defaults to centermouse.

top=number
left=number
width=umber
height=number

 Position and size to open  the CA window. Using the left parameter over rides the relative positioning above.

 Switch to have the CA window return keystrokes.

sendqual  (sq)

(See modify parameters below)

help (h)

  Switch to have the CA window return help events.

state

Switch to have the CA window return active/inactive events.

refresh

Switch to have the CA window return refresh events. This is only useful if you are doing your rendering directly into the window.

defer

 Switch to defer window layout from the input device to the pipe task. This will make input.device more responsive, and drop the (possibly quite heavy)process of recalculating the display to normal application priority instead of the priority 20 of input.device.

 It also means window refresh is blocked if you are sending modify commands to the pipe. The window refreshes AFTER you send 'continue'.

SpaceOuter (so)

tags="tags|data[|tag|data...]|0

 A list of tag and value pairs in HEX. Do not forget the trailing null !

info

 Include the drawinfo pen array for the screen in the reply to the window definition line.

 If successful the reply is

'ok window NUMBERofPENS PEN0 PEN1 ...'

see include:intuition/screen.h for more about drawinfo pens.


Modify GID 0
------------

GID 0 is used to specify the GUI window itself. It can be used in modify lines to control certain aspects of the window.

selected=function_bitmap (s=)
