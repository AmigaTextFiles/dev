Arexx event  stream
-------------------

Arexx events are handled differently than other types of events, be careful.

The events are as follows.


'arexx FID textlength <newline> text'

    FID is the function ID number

    textlength is the length of the text after the newline character.


If modify is turned on, after each event you MUST write a single line to the pipe in the following format.

'rc=number result="(result text|length)" [bd]'

If rc > 0 result is ignored, if RC is omitted it defaults to 0.

If the bd (binary data) keyword is given result MUST be the length of the data to be returned, and you then MUST write length chars of data to the pipe.

The pipe replies with 'ok' to your result line (unless quiet is set).

If modify is not turned on all arexx events are given a rc of 0 (success) and a null result.

Arexx object parameters.
-------------------------

gadgettext="HOSTNAME|Function0|Function1|..."  (gt=)

The gadget text defines the arexx host name and the functions available. Hostname should be all capitals, function names should not contain spaces. The first function is FID 0, the second FID 1, ...

slot

This switch causes a slot number to appended to the host name. TESTHOST would become TESTHOST.1 or TESTHOST.2 etc.

Arexx definition Reply
----------------------

 When the ARexx object creation is successful the pipe replies with

'ok HOSTNAME'

NOTE only one arexx host can be defined for each GUI window.

Additional info
---------------------

To have a arexx host with no GUI window, set the NoWindow switch in the window definition.  See the window docs for more information.
