BrowserNode gadget parameters.
-------------------------

 Browsernodes always belong to last defined listbrowser. NEVER use the BrowserNode keyword after you GUI window has opened. Use the AddNode modify command instead.

selected=number (s=)

  The node is selected if number != 0 , unselected if number = 0. Defaults to unselected.


  Set which choice is selected when the window opens. This is only for multiple select list browsers. Set selected in the Listbrowser definition for single select lists.

GadgetText="[^|¶]text0|[^|¶]text1|[^|¶]text..." (gt=)

 Set the text(s). This parameter MUST be given. YOU MUST NOT GIVE MORE TEXTS THAN THE AMOUNT OF COLUMNS IN THE LISTBROWSER. A leading '^' makes the text editable. A leading '¶' (ALT p) uses the last defined image for the column rather than text. Note that images used in browsernodes can not be more than 255 pixels high. (hint: split larger images and use more than one node)

NOTE: the following parameters may only be used if the ListBrowser containing the node allows parenting.

defnumber=number  (defn=)

 Set the Generation of this browser node.

browsernodeparent  (bnp)

 This browser node has children.

removenode (remn)

 remove this browsernode from its ListBrowser

selected=number (s=)

  The node is selected if number != 0 , unselected if number = 0. This is only for nodes in multi select listbrowsers, for single select browsers see the listbrowser modify docs.

read
sort=COLUMN#

 To read a browser node you must also specify a column. The text contents of
that column are returned.

refresh (ref)

 Refresh this listnodes listbrowser (not just the node itself). When setting multiple nodes in a multiselect listbrowser only refresh when you set the last node. This avoids multiple refreshes.

hidechild=num (hc=)

 If num =0 show all this nodes children . If num >0 then hide all this nodes children.
