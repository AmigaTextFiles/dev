 AWNPipe itself is stable and quite well tested. These docs are still a work in progress so please excuse typos and omissions.

 At first glance AWNPipe may appear complex. Actually each of the functions in the pipe are simple to use when taken individually. Don't try to learn everything at once, pick a single function and try it out. Each function can be used without knowing anything about the other functions.

 Most of you will be primarily interested in building and operating GUI's. You can go directly to the GUI Creation section and start there. The important part to read about is the conversation, then try the tutorials in that section.

 To learn about pipe functions go straight to Pipe Functions/Tutorials/Simple and work through the examples.

 Right Amiga C can be used to cut and paste example text from the docs. This helps to avoid typos.

Feel free to contact me, <bill@amitrix.com>, with your questions and comments.

 Have Fun !
