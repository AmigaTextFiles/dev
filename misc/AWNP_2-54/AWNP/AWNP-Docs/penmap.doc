PenMap parameters
-------------------

The penmap keyword does not produce a gadget.  It creates an image to be used later. Up to 50 images can be predefined, the last one defined is the first one used. Last In First Out.

bindata (bd)

The PenMapPalette,penmapdata, and selectedimage  will be passed to this pipe in binary after the command line, AND IN THAT ORDER. The penmapdata,selectedimage, and PenMapPalette parameters now give the length of each data segment. Do NOT specify a data length of 0 for selected image, omit the keyword instead.

dataout="filename" (do)

 Send the data for this gadget to a file. This is a development tool to allow you to create binary data to pass to the pipe. It is ignored if the Bindata keyword is also present.

penmapdata="data" (pmd)

The image data. NOTE all values are ascii HEX. The data is in the following format.

"width_h_byte|width_l_byte|height_h_byte|height_l_byte|data1|data2..."

If the bindata keyword is used the image data is the following format

word width, height;
char data[];

Note the size specified in penmapdata INCLUDES the 4 bytes for width and height.

selectedimage="data" (si)

The image data for a selected image. NOTE all values are ascii HEX. The data is in the following format.

"width_h_byte|width_l_byte|height_h_byte|height_l_byte|data1|data2..."

If the bindata keyword is used the image data is the same format as
for penmapdata.

PenMapPalette="data" (pmp)

The palate data. NOTE all values are ascii HEX. The data is in the following format.

"triplet_count|red1|green1|blue1|red2|..."

If the bindata keyword is used the palate data is the format

           ULONG palette[] =
           {
               number_triplets,
               red1, green1, blue1,
               red2, green2, blue2,
               ...
           };
