ListBrowser gadget event
-------------------------

'gadget GID event_source event_column NodeGID [NodeGID [NodeGID ...]]'

event_source&1 means normal selection of node.

event_source&2 means this nodes children have been hidden.

event_source&4 means this nodes children are now shown.

event_source&8 means node has been edited.

event_source&16 means double click on node.

event_column is the column the mouse was over when the node was clicked.

ListBrowser gadget parameters.
-------------------------

font=GID

This sets the font for the gadget. The GID points to an ALREADY defined text attribute.

readonly (ro)

 This list browser entries can not be edited.

disable=number (dis=)

 The gadget is enabled if number = 0 , disabled if number != 0. Defaults to enabled.

selected=number (s=)

  Set which choice is selected when the window opens. Selections start at 0 . This defaults to none. CAREFUL modify uses the listnode GID, this parameter uses the ordinal position of the node.

ListbrowserLabels="text0|text1|text..."  (lbl=)

 Set the column labels for the list. Defaults to 1 unlabeled column.  NO MORE THAN 20 COLUMNS can be defined !

bnparent (bnp)

 Allow parenting in this listbrowser.

showtitles (st)

 Show the column tiles of this listbrowser.

vertical (v)

 Use vertical separators in the listbrowser.

hori (h)

 Use horizontal separators in the listbrowser.

arrows   (a)

 Show arrows for horizontal scrolling and make this a virtual width list.

multi  (m)

 Switch to allow multi selection in the list. Multi select by holding the shift key.

minwidth=number (minw=)

 Set the minimum width for this gadget

minheight=number (minh=)

 Set the minimum height for this gadget

weightedwidth=number (weiw=)

 Set the weighted width for this gadget

weightedheight=number (weih=)

 Set the weighted height for this gadget

nominalsize (noms)

 Set this gadget to its nominal size.

SPECIAL FUNCTION
-----------------
/* do not use this function it may be removed !*/
/* instead see the note at the end of this doc */
 Using sort on a line BY ITSELF during gadget definitions will cause the last defined listbrowser to be sorted. This is to allow a list browser to be sorted before the gui window is opened. (the modify sort command sorts the listbrowser after the window is opened.)

sort=COLUMN#

(optional) sort=COLUMN# defn=COLUMN#

 Sort list browser based on the column number, if the sort entries are the save a secondary sort based on the defaultnumber column is done. Specifying a secondary column to sort by is optional. Remember columns start at 0. You MUST NOT specify an invalid column number.

Definition Reply
-----------------

 When the gadget creation is successful the pipe replies with

'ok GID'

ListBrowser gadget modify parameters.
-------------------------
down

Select the next node in the list.

up

Select the previous node in the list.

addnode (addn)

 Add a new node to this ListBrowser.

 You should keep this modify command a s simple as possible, only use keywords that specifically deal with the creation of the node. (tar gt bnp defn sc )

 Put additional changes like select= or disable = in a separate modify line. Some keywords like refresh, tick, disable, sort, and others could cause extra 'oks' to be in the response line.

 Keep it simple and this modify command is responded to with 'ok GID' where GID is the ID of the browser node.

GadgetText="[^|¶]text0|[^|¶]text1|[^|¶]text..." (gt=)

 Set the text(s) for the added node. This parameter MUST be given if you are using 'addnode' . YOU MUST NOT GIVE MORE TEXTS THAN THE AMOUNT OF COLUMNS IN THE LISTBROWSER. A leading '^' makes the text editable. A leading '¶' (ALT p) uses the last defined image for the column rather than text. Note that images used in browsernodes can not be more than 255 pixels high. (hint: split larger images and use more than one node)

defnumber=number  (defn=)

 Set the Generation of this browser node.

target=GID  (tar=)

 If GID=0 add the new node at head of list. If GID=-1 add the new node at tail of list. Else add the new node immediately after the node specified by GID.

browsernodeparent  (bnp)

 The new browser node has children.

List=number

 If number=0 detach the node list from the listbrowser. If number!=0 then reattaches the node list to the listbrowser.

removenode (remn)

 Remove ALL browsernodes from this ListBrowser.

readonly (ro)

 This list browser entries can not be edited.

disable=number (dis=)

 The gadget is enabled if number = 0 , disabled if number != 0.

scroll=GID (scr=)

 Scroll the listbrowser so the node specified by GID is at the top.

selected=num (s=)

  For multi select lists

 Setting selected=0 sets all nodes as unselected. Setting selected=-1 sets all nodes as selected.  You may set the nodes individually instead of using this command. See browsernode modify commands.

selected=node_GID (s=)

  For single select lists

 Set the selected node. Selected=0 sets all nodes as unselected, else the specified node is selected. CAREFUL modify uses the listnode GID not the ordinal position. This is different then in the listbrowser definition.

order

 Read the order of nodes in the listbrowser. This does not return the normal 'ok' instead it returns a sequence of GID's in the same order as the nodes in the listbrowser. THIS COMMAND SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH ANY OTHER MODIFY COMMANDS ON THE SAME LINE.

sort=COLUMN#

(optional) sort=COLUMN# defn=COLUMN#

 Sort list browser based on the column number, if the sort entries are the save a secondary sort based on the defaultnumber column is done. Specifying a secondary column to sort by is optional. Remember columns start at 0. You MUST NOT specify an invalid column number.

autofit

 This keyword forces the listbrowser to evaluate its size. It is only needed when a listbrowser uses a font other than the screen default font AND no new browser nodes are added after the GUI window is opened.

hidechild=num (hc=)

 If num =0 show all the children in this listbrowser. If num !=0 then hide all the children in this listbrowser.

NOTE: At times you may want to modify a listbrowser after is is created, but BEFORE the window is opened. Use the 'NoWindow' keyword in the window definition, create the GUI as usual. When you send 'open' the window does NOT open but you do go into modify mode. Modify the GUI then send 'id 0 s 64' to open the window after it has been modified.
