Data Conversion
----------------

The data passing through the pipe may be modified by the pipe with the following options.

H option
========

html conversion - some special characters are translated into html tokens.
& > <  become &amp; &lt; &gt;
This option must be specified on the file handle that is written.

copy ram:test AWNPipe:test/h
copy AWNPipe:test ram:test2


G option
========

The same as the H option above, except that any special html character preceded by an '@' is not converted. The preceding '@' is removed during the translation process.

U option
========

UNhtml conversion - some html tokens are translated into special character.
&amp; &lt; &gt; become & > <
Tokens of the form &#NUM; are also translated.
This option must be specified on the file handle that is written to..

copy ram:test AWNPipe:test/u
copy AWNPipe:test ram:test2

P option
========

AWebPost conversion - some special characters are translated into standard ascii. This must be specified on the file handle that does the writing.

copy ram:test AWNPipe:test/p
copy AWNPipe:test ram:test2

B option
========

backwards blocks - characters read from a pipe are returned in reverse order
of the character blocks written. This must be specified on the
file handle that does the reading.

if you write 5 blocks of characters .....

'hello'
'world'
'1'
'2'
'3'

they are read back as

321worldhello

Funny things can happen if you read before all writes are completed.

O option
========

 Adds the text '<option>' after every '0a'x . I use it in AWebNews.

copy ram:test AWNPipe:test/o
copy AWNPipe:test ram:test2
