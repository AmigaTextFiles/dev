 Several GUIs of example gadgets can be viewed by running the Gadgets# in the demos drawer inside AWNP-Docs. To generate these GUIs a simple text file is being copied to a GUI generating pipe. The 'wcon:300//200/200/PipeEvents' at the end of the pipe name simply sends the output of the pipe to a con so you can see what is going on.

 Some example scripts using pipe generated GUIs are also in the demo drawer. These demos are mostly ARexx or ADOS scripts. Load them in your text editor and take a look at them. I think you will find they are very simple script considering the powerful GUIs they create. Reading the comments in the scripts should help you when learning to build and operate your own AWNPipe GUIs.

 CAList is an ADOS script. It is graphical wrapper for the standard list command. It is a VERY simple script. Put it in 'C:' with its script bit set if you like it enough to make regular use of it. Use 'calist ?' to get a usage display.

 This script gives a good example of how to build a simple gui. It shows how much can be accomplished  in a short script.

---

 Form is an ADOS script that displays a form. Use 'execute Form' or set the script bit for the file and simply type 'form'.

 This gui is truly interactive and requires the name to be set before the form is accepted. It allows resting of the form and knows when the user aborts.Its rather extreme for an ADOS script but is included to show you just how much can be accomplished with ADOS and AWNPipe working together. ADOS wizards may find the handling of the event file and environment variables interesting.

 Fonttoy is an ADOS script to play with fonts. Use 'execute FontToy' or set the script bit for the file and simply type 'fonttoy'.

 This script creates a very simple gui. However it uses gadget interconnection to do some magic that only experienced GUI developers are likely to understand. It also uses numerical tag values, you will likely never do this. Note that numerical tags CAN be used with defining AWNPipe GUIs and this means you will be able to access new CA/Reaction features as they come out without changes to AWNPipe.

 Dict-thesar.rx is an arexx script. It is run from its icon or shell. words are search in the Merriam Webster site so you must be online. The menu will start and control miami if you have it installed. Bubble help is provided and it is simple to use so no real docs are needed.

You should find this tool useful enough to keep installed on your system.

 xo.rx is an arexx script. Use 'rx xo.rx' to run it. You must 'cd' into the demo drawer first so it can find its image file (xo.gif). It does not play against you so you must  play both sides of the game. (click in the squares).

 It changes the button images in a operating GUI. It shows how to create multiple images from a single source image. It also lets you see how to modify a gui after it has been opened. An additional gadget is even added to the GUI after it has been opened. Take a look at xo.gif in an image viewer, you may be surprised to see how small the image is.

 DropBox.rx can be run from its icon or by typing 'rx dropbox.rx' in a shell. Looking at the tooltypes of Drop box should help you understand what is going on. You set tooltypes to tell the program what to do with files or drawers that are dropped on it. I hope it is something you will keep around and be able to make use of. With a little modification it could be very powerful indeed.

 The gui is so simple it almost unbelievable, however it is an app window. That makes it very special. The script also makes heavy use of AWNPipes ability to do pattern matching. Finally the script will also teach you how to read tooltypes using AWNPipe.

Possible tool types.

pat (pattern)=YourCommandText

This tells dropbox  to execute your command for any files that match the pattern you have set. '%f' in the command is replaced by the name of the file that was dropped on dropbox.

pat (pattern)=drawer

Tells DropBox to use its default drawer handling for that pattern.

pat (pattern)=image

Tells DropBox to use its default image handling for that pattern.

pat (pattern)=text

Tells DropBox to use its default text handling for that pattern.

bin BinaryPattern=YourCommandText

This tells dropbox  to execute your command for any files whose first 12 bytes match the binarypattern you have set. '?' is the only wildcard allowed in the BinaryPattern. '%f' in the command is replaced by the name of the file that was dropped on dropbox. iconify

A tooltype of 'iconify' tells DropBox to iconify itself as soon as it is run. You can still drop files on the iconified window to have dropbox process them.

multi

A tooltype of 'multi' tells DropBox to allow files dropped on it to have more than one command run for them. The default is for dropbox only to only respond once to each file dropped.

 The first real projects to use AWNPipe GUIs were some aweb utilities.

CacheControl.awebrx allows you to micro manage AWebs caching of websites.

Put the script and CacheControl_doc.html in AWeb3:plugins, it may be called directly from the ARexx menu or from an AWeb button.

GUI Button
name            CCtrl
command         run awebpath:plugins/cachecontrol.awebrx

ARexx Menu
title           CacheControl
macro           awebpath:plugins/cachecontrol.awebrx

---

AWebModes.awebrx allows you to easily control many of AWebs settings. Gabriele Favrin has kindly allowed a version of it to be included here. Put the script and AWebModes_Doc.html in AWeb3:plugins, it may be called directly from the ARexx menu or from an AWeb button.

GUI Button
name            Modes
command         run awebpath:plugins/AwebModes.awebrx

ARexx Menu
title           AWebModes
macro           awebpath:plugins/AWebModes.awebrx

---

DropZone.awebrx opens an appwindow on WB so you can drag and drop files to be displayed in AWeb, even while aweb is on its own screen. Put the script and DropZone_Doc.html in AWeb3:plugins. It may be called directly from the ARexx menu or from an AWeb button.

GUI Button
name            DZone
command         run awebpath:plugins/DropZone.awebrx

ARexx Menu
title           ChangeModes
macro           awebpath:plugins/DropZone.awebrx
