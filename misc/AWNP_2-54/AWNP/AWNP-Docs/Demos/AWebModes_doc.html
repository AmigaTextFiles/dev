<h2><a name="1">Introduction</a></h2><p>

<strong>AWeb Modes</strong> is an ARexx script that allows you to easily change
frequently used AWeb settings without the need to search for them in the various
settings windows. <strong>AWeb Modes</strong> uses William Parker's
<strong>AWNPipe:</strong> to build a Reaction interface with menues and
hotkeys.<p>

<h2><a name="2">Installation</a></h2>

Installer should already have installed all the files in the proper directories
and configured AWeb, but if you prefer to install <strong>AWeb Modes</strong>
manually you must proceed as described:

<ol>
<li>Copy to the &quot;AWeb/Plugins/&quot; directory the following files:<p>

<ul>
<li>AWebModes.awebrx
<li>AWebModes_doc.html
</ul><br><br>

<li>Configure AWeb. AWeb Modes may be called from AWeb in several ways. You
can use a userbutton, a menu entry or a key.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong> if you are using AWeb 3.3SE you can't configure menues
or keys. In the 3.3SE version AWeb Modes it's assigned by default to an user
button.<p>

To set AWeb Modes in AWeb (as a menu, user button or a key), add the
following entry in the appropriate AWeb GUI settings.<p>

<strong>Title:</strong> Modes<br>
<strong>Command:</strong> <code>RUN AWebPath:Plugins/AWebModes.awebrx</code>
</ol><p>

<h2><a name="3">Usage</a></h2>

AWeb Modes opens a Reaction interface from which you may change the
various settings. If it's started while another copy is running, the second
one will simply move the first copy in front of all other windows and quit. In
some cases it can be faster to restart AWeb Modes then search for
its window.<p>

These are the available functions:

<h3 align="center">AWeb Modes GUI</h3>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Strict (HTML 2.0/3.2/4.0)<br>Tolerant (also 3.0/MSIE/NS HTML)<br>Compatible (badly written HTML)</strong>
<dd>These three options are mutually exclusive. You can choose one of them
(with mouse or the hotkeys S, T or C) to get the relative HTML mode.<p>

<dt><strong>Use Frames</strong> (hotkey: F)
<dd>Toggle frame usage.<p>

<dt><strong>Nominal (fixed) frames height</strong> (hotkey: N)
<dd>Toggle the frame height to make framesets more readable
on low resolution screens.<p>

This option can only be changed when <strong>&quot;Frame usage&quot;</strong>
is enabled.<p>

<dt><strong>GIF animations playback</strong> (hotkey: G)
<dd>Toggle GIF animation playback.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong> this option can be changed only if the
<cite>AWebGif.awebplugin</cite> has been already been used in the current AWeb
session to display a GIF image.<p>

<dt><strong>JavaScript usage</strong> (hotkey: J)
<dd>Toggle JavaScript usage.<p>

<dt><strong>Show JavaScript errors</strong> (hotkey: E)
<dd>Toggle the displaying of errors found in JS scripts.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong> this option can be changed only if
<strong>&quot;JavaScript usage&quot;</strong> is enabled.<p>

<dt><strong>Suppress JS banner window</strong> (hotkey: B)
<dd>Toggle the displaying of the JS generated banner popup windows.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong> this option can be changed only
if <strong>&quot;JavaScript usage&quot;</strong> is enabled and only from the
<strong>full version</strong> of AWeb.<p>

<dt><strong>Anonymous browsing</strong> (hotkey: A)
<dd>Toggle the stripping of the HTTP &quot;referrer&quot; header which sends
the URL of the last visited page to servers.<p>

<dt><strong>Spoofing</strong> (hotkey: P)
<dd>Toggle the spoof of Netscape 3.x when sending the &quot;User Agent&quot;
HTTP header to a server.<p>

<strong>Note:</strong> AWeb can spoof other browsers as well but NS 3.x is
the one with the most similar JavaScript support, so in most cases it's best
spoof to use. Note also that this option can only be changed from the
<strong>full version</strong> of AWeb.<p>

<dt><strong>Ignore MIME TYPE server header</strong> (hotkey: M)
<dd>Toggle the ignoring of the server &quot;MIME type&quot; header (useful only for
badly configured servers, if left turned on it can cause serious problems in your daily
browsing!).<p>

<dt><strong>RFC 2109 compliant cookies</strong> (hotkey: 9)
<dd>Toggle the usage of the cookies definition standard described in RFC 2109.
Disabling it can improve compatibility with some servers, other sites may
need it turned on.<p>

<dt><strong>Show Navigation gadgets</strong> (hotkey: V)
<dd>Toggle the displaying of the navigation buttons, status, and url
fields.<p>

<dt><strong>Show User buttons</strong> (hotkey: U)
<dd>Toggle the displaying of the user buttons.
</dl><p>

<strong>Note:</strong> when either of the last two option is changed, all the
open browser windows are closed and then reopened. AWeb Modes waits 75 ms
and then put it's window in front of all others. This delay is usually long enough.
In case it is not, it's possible to get AWeb Modes back in front by just
restarting it.<p>

<h3 align="center">AWeb Modes menues</h3>

AWeb Modes offers some options in the <strong>Project</strong> menu. Beyond
the about menues, there is a <strong>Window</strong> menu with the following
items:<p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Snapshot</strong> (hotkey: right Amiga + S)
<dd>Saves the current position and size of the AWeb Modes GUI.<p>

<dt><strong>Unsnapshot</strong> (hotkey: right Amiga + U)
<dd>Forget the saved position and size of the AWeb Modes GUI.<p>

<dt><strong>Small</strong> (hotkey: right Amiga + M)
<dd>Toggle between a big and small AWeb Modes window.
</dl><p>

<h2><a name="4">ARexx host</a></h2><p>

Thanks to the power of AWNPipe: this humble ARexx script has also an... ARexx
interface!<p>
The ARexx host is called <strong>AWEBMODES</strong> and supports the
following commands:<p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>front</strong>
<dd>Move the AWeb Modes GUI in front of all other windows.<p>

<dt><strong>quit</strong>
<dd>Tells AWeb Modes to close its GUI and quit.
</dl><p>

If you have written a program that forces AWeb to open a new window, you can bring
AWeb Modes back to the front automatically. Here is a short
example.<p>

<pre>'NEW &quot;file://localhost/'filename'&quot;'
if Show('P','AWEBMODES') then address AWEBMODES 'front'</pre><p>
