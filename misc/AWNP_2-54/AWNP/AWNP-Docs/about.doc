     AWNPipe:   Multifunction Device
     Author:    William H. M. Parker
     Version:   2.54  31 Jan 2001

 AWNPipe is a new kind of ADOS device. It's functions can be accessed from almost any program including C, E, Assembler, Arexx, and simple ADOS scripts. AWNP has many uses but the most popular is the creation of Graphical User Interfaces. Other functions include clipboard support, tooltype access, pattern matching, Html conversion, data stream twinning, ...
 Programmers will find that GUI development is VERY fast using AWNP and testing various layouts is as easy as editing a text file.

 Programs written using AWNP present the user with a GUI that is easy to use and consistent in form. The ease of adding menus, Arexx hosts, help information and images encourages authors to add more of the 'Nice' features to their programs.

Distribution

 AWNPipe can be freely distributed in the form of this archive, complete and unmodified.

 The operational parts (AWNPipe-handler and AWNPipe) may be included in the distribution of programs using AWNPipe if the following three conditions are met.

1. The distribution contains an install script and the AWNPipe files are handled as follows (NOTE the use of 'copylib' for awnpipe-handler).

(copylib
  (source "device/awnpipe-handler")
  (dest "l:")
  (prompt "Installing AWNPipe-handler")
)
(copyfiles
  (dest "Devs:dosdrivers")
  (source "device/awnpipe")
  (prompt "Installing AWNPipe")
  (infos)
)
(working ("Activating AWNPipe:"))
(run "C:assign AWNPipe: dismount")
(run "C:mount AWNPipe:")

2. The docs mention the use of AWNP and the version number of AWNPipe in the distribution.

3. The AWNPipe author is notified, bill@amitrix.com .

This software is CHILDWARE. I require whoever uses this program to make a donation to a beneficial organization working to help children. If you don't know of any, ask at your local post office and learn how to make a payment to UNICEF. The amount is up to you, but please do it!

Requirements

 AWNPipe requires ADOS 3.x
 You must have Class Act installed or be using ADOS 3.5+ to use the pipes GUI building functions. Class Act can be found on Aminet, or use http://www.amitrix.com/AWeb30ca.lha (the latter has been tested for compatability with AWNPipe).

Support

 Support is currently available from :

 or directly from the AWNP Author, bill@amitrix.com.

Origin

 AWNPipe was originally developed as a way to speed up the execution of my ARexx script AWebNews.awebrx. As I continued writing scripts I added more and more functions to the pipe. Some of the functions have proven useful to others writing Amiga prpgrams. I built these docs in the hope that AWNPipe: will be of use to Amiga programmers in general.

Acknowledgements

 I would like to thank Gabriele Favrin (author of HTTX) for his input, testing and constant encouragement while writing AWNPipe.

 I also thank...

 Bruce Steers for maintaining the AWNP support page and finding many subtle bugs.

 Nils Goers for his testing under ADOS 3.5 and developing his wonderful program T.H.E. using AWNP, as well as his bug reports.

 Bernd Gollesch for writing the script that creates the Amiga Guide and plain
text versions of the docs automagicaly.

 Everyone else who provided bug reports or feed back helping me make AWNP better.
