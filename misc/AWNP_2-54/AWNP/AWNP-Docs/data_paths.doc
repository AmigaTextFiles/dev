Controlling data paths.
-----------------------

T option
========

TEE's or data taps. A tap is a extra read handle on a pipe connection. If the pipe is not yet created the tap will wait for it to be created. A tap does not see any data written to the pipe before the tap was created. Taps are useful to listen in on interactive (2way) pipes as they read the data written to both ends of the pipe.

Try this is 3 separate shells.

type AWNPipe:test/t
type AWNPipe:test
echo > AWNPipe:test "test data"


R option
========

Read a file. The second end of a pipe can be connected to file automatically. The file name is given after the 'R'.

Create a file 'ram:test' containing some text including the characters '<>&'.
Now try this in a shell.

type AWNPipe:test/h/rram:test

The data from ram:test is read through a modifying pipe.

W option
========

Write a file. The second end of a pipe can be connected to file automatically. The file name is given after the 'W'.

Create a file 'ram:test' containing some text including the characters '<>&'.
Now try this in a shell.

copy ram:test AWNPipe:test/h/wram:test2

The data from ram:test is copied into a modifying pipe, the pipe automatically
outputs the data into a second file ram:test2 .

L option
========

Read AND write to an interactive file such as con: . The interactive file name is given after the 'L'.

This is useful to be able to 'tap' into a two way conversation at a con: or other interactive file handle. Instead of opening con: directly, open
AWNPipe:test/Lcon:////mycon/
Now you can open AWNPipe:test/t to tap the data exchanged with the con:.

V option
========

This option opens a pipe directly to the clipboard.

type AWNPipe:test/v

You may also specify a clipboard unit, defaults to 0 (the primary clip).

To access clipboard unit 5

type AWNPipe:test/v5


C option
 ========

This option allows you to set the clipboard

echo "set this as the clip" >AWNPipe:test/c

You may also specify a clipboard unit, defaults to 0 (the primary clip)

To set clipboard unit 5

echo "set this as the clip" >AWNPipe:test/c5

E option
========

execute a command . The file name is given after the 'E'. A command is executed  with the pipe name as an argument. The pipe name replaces a '%' or is placed at the end. You CAN NOT use a '/' instead of a '%' !.

copy ram:test.doc AWNPipe:test/h/eaweb3:aweb-II

copy ram:test.doc "AWNPipe:test/h/eaweb3:aweb-II % config
local"

Both of these load a file ram:test into AWeb through a modifying pipe and call AWeb to view it .

Into a file requester such as AWebs save requester...
'awnpipe:jpeg/eUtil:fjpeg_ecs'
will send the data directly to the viewer.
