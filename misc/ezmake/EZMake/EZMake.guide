@node "Intro" "Introduction"

Hi there, this is the introduction(nothing new I quess).
So, you allready started the program and still gotta "What the hell is this"
feeling? Then this is THE chapter for you!

When you're a fanzy programmer, like me, prefably assembly, and are
working with multi-source projects, you certainly need this tool!


EZMake provides you with an GUI based invironment for compiling source files
like pascal, C/C++, assembler or any programming language which needs an
external compiler callable from shell/CLI.

The advances of EZMake is that you don't have to hazzle around in the shell
to compile/link/edit/run/debug some source/executable. Just click on that
button and it happens. No need to type lots of things anymore or sticking to
that stupid limited editor with something like EZMake buildin.

More reasons to use ezmake:
 It's cool to look at it
 I use it myself
 It's bugfree
 

I have designed EZMake to be very flexible. It works with internal scripts, so
you can program a button to do whatever you want.

I know there are more project managers but they all suck because:
 it's too big (mui)
 or very limited in function
 or stupid design
 and most of them can't handle multiply commands per button


You know it: EZMake is an advanced piece of software


1 more thing:

If you're interested in project-managers but don't like ezmake or simply don't
want to register I appreciate email where you say so. It may be very short.

 examples: ezmake sucks, greetz and die
       or: ezmake rules but I'am busy to crack it, so bye

@node "registration" "Registration"
REGISTRATION

What?? Yups, the demo version is a bit crippeld.
(In fact, I get this by compiling it with SAS-C instead of my assembler!)
 o You can't save
 o and no arexx port(not implented yet)

You can order a full version. It's very cheap
I need that little money because otherwise I've got the feeling I'am doing
work for nothing.
So, get yourself the best project-manager existing.


 In case you like it...

 To get a registered version you need to send me:
   -the orderform
   -the registration fee
   
 If you want to recieve EZMake by postal mail you also need to include:
   -a self-addressed-envelope and a disk
 

 It's only possible to send the money by (snail)mail and only in
 these currencies: 
   Dutch FL 10,-
   Eurocheck Dutch FL 10,-
   US$ 10 (ten dollar)

 WARNING:
  Make sure the money isn't visable from the outside!!! (it could get 'lost')
  (place it between 2 pieces of paper ie)
 
 
 Dutch people with E-mail address:
 Een extra mogelijkheid:
 Maak FL 10,- over op bankrekening 370617584. Vermeld bij de  overschrijving
 je naam en E-mail adres. Stuur me de orderform, ingevult zo ver als mogelijk,
 via E-Mail(belangrijk).


 See the orderform.txt for more details.

 You can always contact me for bugreports, ideas or things like that...

 
 @{"address" link "myaddress"}  

When I've recieved the orderform and money I will send you EMake soon as
possible.


UPDATES
-------

New demo versions will be placed in aminet/dev/misc
It can take a while before I release a next version because I'am pretty
busy and I have to rewrite some code.

If you're a registered user and like to have an update just E-Mail me.
(Don't forget to mention your name and address)
If you want me to send you a disk, make sure I don't have any costs.

@node "usage" "Usage"

@{b}@{u}Starting EZMake@{ub}@{uu}

EZMake can be started from
  shell/cli
  Workbench(no tooltypes yet)

TEMPLATE: FILE/K,QUIT/S,C=COMPILE/S,TOP/N,LEFT/N
  FILE		a ezmke file
  QUIT		quits ezmake(after compiling)
  COMPILE	emulates the MAKE button after loading the ezmke file
  TOP/LEFT	window opening position

EXAMPLE: EZMake file=ezmake.ezmke quit compile


example.ezmke:
Load it. Browse through the program and you know how it works.
You can't compile/make or things like that because there are no sources.


Full manual:
Ok, start EZMake by entering just ezmake.
You will get an cockpit looking window with lots of buttons:

Now puzzle it out! Start with  Listview or sources
 
(Use multiview instead of amigaguide if above links are not outlined right)


@endnode





@node "WindowPrefs" "WindowPrefs"

WINDOWPREFS

For each @{"list" LINK "lists"} you can set some output settings:

 o No Open  : No window will be opened, if output occuires, default output
              will be used. If you started EZMake with run >ram:xyz EZMake,
              outputs will go to ram:xyz. From workbench it's nil:.
 o No Delay : Window will be opened, command list(s) are executed
              then window is closed.
 o Wait 1   : EZMake waits 1 second before closing, giving you the
              opportunity to read the output
 o Wait 2   : idem dito (almost the same as above)
 o Wait 4   : idem dito (almost the same as above)
 o Wait 10  : idem dito (almost the same as above)
 o Wait 60  : idem dito (almost the same as above)

 BE CAREFULL WITH 'run'.
    If you run something and then its default output is closed,
    and the prog wants to output something your system will crash.

NOTE:

 SOURCES LIST    : WindowPrefs is used for the compile/make buttons
 EXECUTABLES LIST: Windowprefs is not used.



@endnode


@node "Save" "Saving a ezmke file"

SAVING  - saving a ezmake file

 default file extension and filter: .ezmke

 Almost all current settings are saved:
  - Selected item for each list
  - All lists with all settings per item

 not saved:
  - list to show
  - Depandant=allways flag (useless to save)

@endnode

@node "Load" "Loading a ezmke file"
LOADING  - loading a ezmake file

 directory is changed to that directory.


@endnode

@node "lists" "lists"

The show button determinates what is being showed in the Listview.
Maby you better use Cycle2Menu with you workbench as there are 11 items
to cycle through.

There is always an item selected in a list.
The selected item (for each list)is saved in the .ezmke file
and is reselected when loaded.


   @{b}@{u}File lists@{ub}@{uu}
   @{"Sources" LINK "ls_source"}
   @{"Executables" LINK "ls_exec"}


   @{b}@{u}Command Lists@{ub}@{uu}
   
   In these lists you put commands which are executed one by one.
   The following words have special meanings:
     %s -Current selected source in the source-list
         NOTE: EZMake selects sources on its own when using the MAKE button.
     %o -Objectname
         Same as %s but with any suffix removed and @{"objectsuffix" LINK "objectsuffix"} added.
     %l -Linker names
         Object names of all sources separated with a space
     %e -Executable name
         The highlited name in the executable list. 
   

   @{"Compiler1/2/3" LINK "ls_compiler"}
   @{"Macro1/Run/Debug/Edit/Linker" LINK "ls_other"}
   @{"Macro2" LINK "ls_macro2"}


@endnode


@node "ls_source" "Sources list"

@{b}@{u}Sources list@{ub}@{uu}

list:
 sources

In this list you put the sources in your project.
It is also used to select which source you want to edit/compile etc.

Every sourcefile has the following settings (source settings):

o Compile:
   Never     : compile never
   Always    : compile always
   Prot.bit A: compile when A-bit is cleared, A-bit is setted after
               compiling. Even when Dependant=Always is checked!!
   ObjectDate: compile if sourcefile date is elder than objectfile date

o Compiler:
   Compiler1
   Compiler2
   Compiler3 
  Here you select which compiler script you want to use for THIS source.
  I use this for changing between compile options

@endnode


@node "ls_exec" "executables list"
@{b}@{u}executables list@{ub}@{uu}

list:
  executable

Select as much executables as you want.(at least 1 is recommended)

The name(item) that is highlighted will be used to compile to.
The highlighted item is used to replace the %e in the commandlists.

Be sure you don't include objects or source files in this list!!

For ease you can use the filerequester:
 select the mainsource
 change the name with the string gadget to (example) <mainsource>.exe. 
 DON'T FORGET TO PRESS ENTER!!

@endnode



@node "ls_compiler" "compiler list"
@{b}@{u}compiler1/compiler2/compiler3 lists@{ub}@{uu}

lists:
  compiler1
  compiler2
  compiler3

One of these 3 lists will be executed when compiling a source-file:
Compiling source files:@{"Make" LINK "bt_make"} @{"compile" LINK "bt_compile"}

example:
  compile from %s to %o     ;compile
  rx ErrorsToEditor         ;parse errors to editor
  echo "compiled and errors parsed"
  echo "click close button to continue"

@endnode

@node "ls_other" "other command list"
@{b}@{u}other list@{ub}@{uu}

Lists:
  Macro1
  Run
  Debug
  Edit
  Linker

Commands in these list are executed when you press the equal named @{"buttons" LINK "bt_other"}.

examples:
 run:	run %e
 Debug:	devpac:monam %e
 Edit:	ced %s (better: rx ced_open %s)
 Link:	blink from %l to %e

@endnode
   
@node "ls_macro2" "macro2 list"
@{b}@{u}macro2 list@{ub}@{uu}

list:
 macro2

When you press the @{"Macro2" LINK "bt_macro2"} button, all commands in this list are
executed FOR EVERY SOUCE-FILE.

example:
  c:delete %s

 This will delete all your sourcefiles you specified in the source-list.
 (ok, stupid example)

@endnode

@node "Selecting files" "EZMake/Selecting files"

@{b}@{u}Selecting files@{ub}@{uu}


General info:
  - To add an new entry, press 'Add'
  - When you use the file requester the dir(+name) in the string-gadget is
    used.
  - Select string-gadget OR the name in the list to edit name.
  - Press *ENTER* to fix the changes in the list.
@endnode

@node "bt_other" "other buttons"
  
buttons:
  Macro1
  Run
  Debug
  Edit
  Link

The equal named @{"list" LINK "lists"} is executed once.
@endnode
 
@node "bt_compile" "compile button"

button: Compile

One of the three compiler-script is executed, depending on
the @{"source-settings" LINK "ls_source"}
  
@endnode

@node "bt_macro2" "macro2 button"

button: Macro2
  The macro2 script will be executed FOR EACH SOURCEFILE.
@endnode

@node "bt_make" "make button"

button: Make
  This button will compile every source in the sourcelist depending on the
  source settings. Then the program is linked just like you clicked
  the Link button.
  Your programm is compiled now!
  If you show the sources in the listview you actually see the sources
  being selected one by one(and the settings too).

@endnode

@node "window" "EZMake/Global"

GLOBAL SETTINGS/Window

  Define here a window that will be opened depending on the
  @{"WindowPrefs" LINK "WindowPrefs"}. It is allowed to specify
  a file here. EXAMPLE: CON:0/0/640/200/bleh/AUTO/WAIT/CLOSE
  hmm, maby you didn't know:
    AUTO=open window visually only when output occuries
    WAIT=blocks windowclosing till user closes it. (by CTRL-\ for ex.)
    CLOSE=Add an close gadget to the window. (can be used instead of ctrl-\)

@endnode

@node "ObjectSuffix" "EZMake/ObjectSuffix"

GLOBAL SETTINGS/ObjectSuffix

  Put here the object-suffix (INCLUDING THE '.') you want to
  use for your objects. Recommended is '.o'. This is used to create a
  object-name which will replace the %o in a commandlist.

@endnode

@node "Dependant" "EZMake/Dependant"

GLOBAL SETTINGS/Dependant=Allways

  When this box is checked ALL sources are compiled when
  pressing @{"MAKE" LINK "bt_make"}. It does not matter what the compile-
  settings are, except when it's 'NEVER', then it won't be compiled.
