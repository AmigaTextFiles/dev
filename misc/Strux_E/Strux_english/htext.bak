#m 2000
menu: Refinements
Here you find all functions concerning the refinement of blocks. With
a refinement, the function of a block can be specified more precisely
with an additional flowchart.

#m 2010
menu item: Refinements » Refine Block
A refinement is attached to the current block, this means that the function
of this block is described more precisely in a seperate flowchart.\
A new flowchart appears on the screen with the name of the refined block
as the title. You can edit this flowchart with all the known functions
including further refinements.\
A refined block is shown in bold letters if the menu option "Refinements »
Show ?" is selected.\
If a block already has a refinement, you can get into its refinement with a
double click on the block.\\
With the menu item "Refinements » Higher Level" you can get back to the
block that has been refined.

#m 2020
menu item: Refinements » Higher Level
You get back to the previous level of refinements, exactly to the block
which has been refined.\\
By double clicking on the top border of the diagram (not the window)
you also get back to the higher level.

#m 2030
menu item: Refinements » Top Level
You immediately get back to the top level of the flowchart.

#m 2050
menu item: Refinements » Show ?
Here you can select whether all refined blocks should be marked or not.\
All refined blocks are shown in bold letters. One of them is written in
another color, which means that the refinement is actually attached
to this block. All operations done with this block (Cut, Copy, Paste etc.)
have influence on the refinement.

#m 2060
submenu: Refinements » to "Subroutine"
You can choose if refinements are shown as blocks of type "Subroutine".\
This can be useful as blocks of type "Subroutine" are translated differently
(e.g. as a procedure call) when saving the flowchart as text.

#m 2061
menu item: Refinements » to "Subroutine" » Automatically ?
When this menu item is switched on, each block that is refined is converted
to the type "Subroutine".\
This can be useful as blocks of type "Subroutine" are translated differently
(e.g. as a procedure call) when saving the flowchart as text.\
However, the conversion is only possible with blocks of type "Action",
"Input" or "Output". All other blocks keep their type.

#m 2062
menu item: Refinements » to "Subroutine" » Change All
All refined blocks are converted to the type "Subroutine".\
This can be useful as blocks of type "Subroutine" are translated differently
(e.g. as a procedure call) when saving the flowchart as text.\
However, the conversion is only possible with blocks of type "Action",
"Input" or "Output". All other blocks keep their type.\\
ATTENTION: The conversion cannot be reversed !

#m 2070
menu item: Refinements » Set Main Refinement
If the current block has a refinement, the actual flowchart of this 
refinement will be attached to this block. Its text will be shown with a
different color if the menu item "Refinements » Show ?" is switched on.\
All operations done with this block (Cut, Copy, Paste etc.) now have 
influence on the refinement.

menu item: Add » Select of
A decision with a choice of several branches will be inserted below the
current block.\
(multiple exclusive selective)

#m 3060
menu item: Add » Case
Another branch with another condition will be added to a "Select" block.

#m 3070
menu item: Add » Default/Else

(manual operation)\
The graphical representation is the same as for the type "Output", but both
types are translated differently when saving the flowchart as text.

#m 3180
menu item: Add » Output
An output will be inserted below the current block.\
(manual operation)\
The graphical representation is the same as for the type "Input", but both
types are translated differently when saving the flowchart as text.

the loop block itself)\
"down" : jump to the bottom block of a branch or loop body\
"right": jump to the last case (e.g. in a "Case" construct)\\
- with control key:\
"up"   : jump to the top block of the displayed flowchart\
"down" : jump to the last block of the displayed flowchart

#e 01
clipboard
Like in word processors, you can cut or copy parts of the flowchart and
paste them somewhere else. The most recent cut part is kept in the
clipboard until something new is cut or copied.\
There are different independent clipboard units with numbers from 0
to 255. Normally, all programs use unit zero, so they can exchange
data among each other. If you do not want this, you can change the number.
(menu item "Settings » Program...")

#e 02
current block
One block in the diagram is marked by reverse colors. This is the
"current block", it corresponds to the cursor in a word processor.
E.g. new blocks are always inserted below this block, the cut or copy
operations refer to this block etc.\
To select a block (make it the "current block") you may simply click on
it with the mouse.\
In blocks like selections or loops, the whole block with all branches
is marked and taken as the current block.

filerequester
To select filenames, a filerequester is displayed. Here you can select the
path and the name of the desired file.\
As this is a standard filerequester, please refer to your Workbench
documentation for more information.

#e 04
fontrequester
To select Fonts, a fontrequester is displayed. Here you can select a
font and the height of that font.\
As this is a standard fontrequester, please refer to your Workbench
documentation for more information.

help
There is help available for all menus and menu items, all windows and
some special terms.\
To get help, do the following:\\
· menus and menu items:\
Select the menu or menu item as usual with the right mouse button, but
keep the button pressed. Then, while still holding the right mouse button,
press the help key. After a short time, the help text will be displayed
in this window.\\
· windows:\
Activate the window you need help for by clicking in that window.
Then press the help key. A help text appears for that window.\\
· special terms:\
Select the button "Keywords" in the bottom of this window. A list of
words for which there are help texts appears. By clicking on a word
the help is displayed.\\
When the help is not needed any longer, you can close the window with
the close gadget. It is also possible to continue work while the help
window is displayed.\\
The help texts are for a quick reference and assume that you have
some basic knowledge about Strux. You can find more information and
an introduction to Strux in your printed manual.

#e 06
main refinement
A refinement can be used by several blocks which must have the same text.
However, the flowchart of the refinement exists only once and is actually
attached to one block. The refinement of this block is called the "main
refinement", all other blocks with the same text only have a reference to
the flowchart of the refinement.\
All operations performed with this block (cut, copy, print etc.) have effect
on the refinement.\
If the menu item "Refinements » Show ?" is marked, the text of this block
is written in a different color. When you perform an operation with the
blocks which have only boldfaced text, they have no effect on the
refinement itself !

#e 07
keyboard
Both the menu items and the gadgets in the requesters can be activated by
the keyboard. This allows you to work faster.\\
· menu items:\
Most of the functions have an associated key. These keys are shown in the
menus and have to be pressed together with the right Amiga key to select
this menu item.\\
· requester gadgets:\
The gadgets which have one letter underlined can be selected by pressing
the key with that letter. You can select items in lists with the arrow
keys.

#e 08
Strux-format
When using the Strux-format for saving to disk, the flowchart is saved
with all details, so that it can be restored without change. However,
this format cannot be read by other programs.\
If you save the flowchart as text or as an image, you cannot restore it
completly with Strux, because some information will be lost. But you
can use the texts or images with other programs.
