Strux
¯¯¯¯¯

Strux has been a commercially distributed flowchart editor.
Because the software is not available for more than a year
now, I decided to release it as freeware. This means:

- The manual is only available in DVI format (TeX). There will
  be no other version available from me.

- There is no support given by me.

- The program will not be devoloped any further and no bugs
  will be fixed.

- If the program does not fulfill your requirements, just delete
  it.
