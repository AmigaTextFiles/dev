   The AutodocViewer Lite configuration are base upon list headers and nodes, the node
   handling system in AutodocViewer Lite are very complex. There are many different types
   of nodes, eg. group , autodoc, function nodes etc.<P>

   While an node is created it retreives it's own unique number, which later are saved in
   the configuration file along with other information about the node. This way
   AutodocViewer Lite are able to restore the complete configuration with all linking from
   an function to includes and to other functions within the same autodoc or in another autodocs.<P>
