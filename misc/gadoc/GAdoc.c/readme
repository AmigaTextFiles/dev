This program extracts the autodocs from your source codes and generates
a texinfo file out of it.

What makes this program different from ``autodoc'' [(c) Commodore] is
that it generates a texinfo file.
This has several advantages:

	Easy to generate a hypertext out of it (makeinfo)

	Easy to generate a .dvi file (Using TeX)

	Easy to generate plain ASCII text (makeinfo)

GAdoc is very easy to use, just open a shell and enter the following


	gadoc <source> <dest> [options]


This will extract the autodocs from <source> and generate two new files
<dest>.menu and <dest>.data, where <dest>.menu is the main part.


Options:

         -i:     Also extract internal documentation
         -c:     Convert \* to /* and *\ to */
         -amiga: Include amiga support for texinfo
         -aicon: Generate an icon for the Amiga workbench (GUI)
         -s<ID>: Only extract entries that have a special ID, default
		 ID is "**".


Please read the documentation for further details.
Check the file ``2PagesTexi.scr'', if you want to use gadoc in
combination with TeX; it makes a booklet out of your .dvi file.

This program was inspired by Robodoc 0.92:

Well, Robodoc didn't work very well with my CLisp source files, so I wrote
my own program.


GADOC and NON-AMIGA systems

The .info files contain the icon information for the amiga workbench
(graphical user interface). You may delete them, BUT NOT IF YOU WANT TO
RE-DISTRIBUTE gadoc!
