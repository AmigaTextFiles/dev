   A program to extract the autodocs from your source files.

   `Get Autodoc' generates a texinfo file, which can be converted into
a .dvi file with TeX or into a hypertext using makeinfo.

Requirements
************

                         Amiga computer family

   The minimal configuration for running this program is at least 1MB
of free RAM. If you got a compiled version of the program, you need at
least OS 2.04, too, because it got compiled using gcc263 and this is an
2.x only compiler.

   If you want to use the `-aicon' option, you should use Amiga OS 3.0
at least, since this icon calls multiview, which gets shipped with OS
3.0 and later versions.

                                Others

   To recompile GAdoc, you need an ANSI/C compiler, GNU/C works.  Just
type in "make" (using gcc) and wait.

   If you want to use this program with MS-DOS, you have to alter the
file extexsions, of the generated programs, otherwise the program might
not work at all.

   Using this piece of software with U*IX computers caused no problem
with SOLARIS and NetBSD. Use it at your own risk on other architectures.

Installation
************

   Just copy the executable to somewhere in your path.

What are autodocs?
******************

   Every programmer knows about the problems of software documentation
or problems that arise from team work.

   After having finished a project or a part of it, you are glad that
it works at all, but what about your partner or your boss? They also
want to have the functions documented, if possible printed on paper.

   Now you have to sit down again and write down all what you know
about your functions. But what happens after you change some parts of
your functions, or add some ...? Your documentation will have to be
rewritten.

   That's really a problem that also affects big firms, not only hobby
programmers. There exist several systems, that allow you to write your
program and documentation at the same time, like cweb does. cweb is
great and very powerful, but most of the time, programmers need
something more simple, this is the time where autodocs enter your life.

   Autodocs are easy to use within your source code, no matter which
language you use, you only need a language, that allows you to use
blocks of comments.

Starting a project
==================

   Every source file should start with an autodoc, that describes your
project and gives GAdoc information about the author, the copyright
holder etc.

   Here is an example:

     /****h* project/Intro ***
     *
     * NAME
     *  project
     *
     * COPYRIGHT
     *  No name software, inc.
     *
     * FUNCTION
     *   This project is a project about projects.
     *
     * AUTHOR
     *  Gerhard Leibrock
     *
     * VERSION
     *  1.0
     *
     * NOTES
     *  Its not the size of the ship, its the size of the waves.
     *  LITTLE RICHARD
     *
     *
     ***/

   The first character of the first line gets ignored, then the line is
checked for 4 asterisks followed by "h*" and a space.

`Note:'
     Because GAdoc supports the usage of IDs that can be written
     instead of   the 2nd and 3rd asterisk, it is also possible to
     begin the autodoc entry   with something different from "/****h*",
     e.g. it can begin with   "/*IT*h*", if you choose "IT" as your
     favourite ID, maybe to indicate   a header written in italian.
     These special autodoc entries can only be   extracted using the
     `-s' argument. This flag can also be used to group   special
     functions, e.g. an ID like "WD" could specify the function as a
     special Window function, or something like that.

     The two asterisks at the 2nd and 3rd position can be seen as the
     default   ID.

   After this "begin" keyword you have to specify the name of the
project followed by a slash ("/") and a short description (Could also be
"project/TheNameOfTheGame").

   The keywords have the following meaning:

`NAME'
     What's the name of your software?

`COPYRIGHT'
     Who holds the copyright?

`FUNCTION'
     What can be done with this program?

`AUTHOR'
     Who wrote the software?

`VERSION'
     Version number, remeber that the numbers should be read as real
     decimals, meaning a Version number of 1.4 (one-point-4) refers to
     an older release than a number of 1.11 (one-point-eleven).

`NOTES'
     Bugs, features, statements, etc.

   Remember that this "header" must be specified before any other
autodoc, otherwise, GAdoc will cease its operation and give you an
error message.

   It is impossible not to specify the header. GAdoc will fill out the
author's name with Unknown, the version number with 0.0 and other vague
values.

   Also remember the order of the keywords, meaning `NAME' should be
specified before `NOTES', etc..

   You should take a look at the GAdoc source code, which gets
delivered with gadoc.

Function description
====================

   Here is an example of an autodoc for a function within C-source code:

     /****** misc/ShowReq *****
     *
     * NAME
     *  ShowReq -- Shows a requester (Needs at least KS 1.3)
     *
     * SYNOPSIS
     *   void = ShowReq( Title, Text);
     *                     D0   D1
     *
     *   void ShowReq ( STRPTR, STRPTR);
     *
     * FUNCTION
     *   Display a requester with title and some text.
     *
     * INPUTS
     *   Title  - Title of the requester
     *   Text   - Message for the user
     *
     * RESULT
     *   None
     *
     * EXAMPLE
     *   ShowReq("J EDGAR HOOVER", "I regret to say that we of the FBI are\\n"
     *                             "powerless to act in cases of oral-genital\\n"
     *                             "intimacy, unless it has in some way\\n"
     *                             "obstructed interstate commerce.");
     *
     *
     * NOTES

     ***/

   An autodoc for functions is recognized through the sequence of six
asterisks ("******"), the first character gets ignored (Here the "/").
Then follows a blank and the name of the module followed by "/" and the
functions name. The rest of the line gets ignored.

   Here some valid examples:

     /****** module/name ------------------------------
     ;****** module/name ------------------------------
     ******* module/name ------------------------------

   This marks six asterisks as a special keyword, which should be used
very carefully.

`Note:'
     Because GAdoc supports the usage of IDs that can be written
     instead of   the 2nd and 3rd asterisk, it is also possible to
     begin the autodoc entry   with something different from "******"
     (6 asterisks), e.g. it can   begin with "/*IT***", maybe to
     indicate an entry written in italian.    These special autodoc
     entries can only be extracted using the `-s'   argument. This flag
     can also be used to group special functions, e.g.    an ID like
     "WD" could specify the function as a special Window   function, or
     something like that.

     The two asterisks could be seen as the "default ID".

   After this "begin" statement follows the description of the
functions.  You can use some of the following keywords to describe it:

`NAME'
     Put in the function's name, followed by two minus ("-") symbols and
      a one line description. You should write sentences, ending with
     a period   (".").

`SYNOPSIS'
     It consists of three parts: The calling convention, the assembly
     registers   and the function prototype. The line with the
     prototype should be   "ready to compile". Take care of this (This
     doesn't matter to GAdoc,   but "autodoc" as shipped with the 3.1
     Amiga Developer Update, requires   this.

`FUNCTION'
     Describe what your function does, try to avoid jargon and use
     generally   accepted english. Write as much as needed but as short
     as possible.

`INPUTS'
     Describe the parameter's valid range and tell the reader what
     happens,   it you receive e.g. a NULL-pointer or something like
     that.    Use the variable name specified in the SYNOPSIS line and
     use a minus   ("-") as a seperator (See example above).

`RESULT'
     Describe the return values and error conditions, as error messages
     ar   also seen as a kind of return value.

`EXAMPLE'
     `Short' example of how to use your function. Test the example to
     avoid   misunderstandings.

`NOTES'
     Hints, warnings, tricks: Talk about side effects (If they exist),
     etc.

`BUGS'
     If your function has bugs, please describe them. Otherwise ignore
     this.

`SEE ALSO'
     If your function needs assistance of other functions, or you want
     the   user to scan e.g. include files, list them here. GAdoc
     recognizes references   to other modules ad generates a cross
     link! But therefore, the name   before the "/" `must' be identical
     to the file, where the function   is located.

   It is very important, that you use the keywords in the order listed
above.  You might ignore some of them, so GAdoc will replace them with
empty ones.

   An autodoc ends with at least three asterisks at the start of a line
("***").

   Please do not use any tabs within your autodos since they are of no
use with makeinfo or TeX.

Internal functions
==================

   If you do have functions, that should not be documented to others
for any reason, you should mark them with "****i*" (four asterisks, "i",
one asterisk). These functions will only be extracted if you specify the
"-i" option with GAdoc.

`Note:'
     Because GAdoc supports the usage of IDs that can be written
     instead of   the 2nd and 3rd asterisk, it is also possible to mark
     the autodoc entry   with something different from "****i*", e.g.
     it could look like   "*IT*i*", maybe to indicate a header written
     in italian. These   special autodoc entries can only be extracted
     using the `-s'   argument. The two asterisks could be seen as the
     "default ID".

   The syntax for internal functions is identical to that of normal
functions.

How to use GAdoc
****************

   GAdoc can be used from any shell and accepts the following
parameters:

   gadoc <source> <output> [-i -c -s<id> -amiga  -aicon]

`<source>:'
     Name of the source files

`<output>:'
     Name of the generated files <output>.menu, <output>.data
     (Existing files with identical names will be deleted without
     warning!)

`-i'
     Also extract internal autodocs

`-c'
     Convert `\\*' (Backslash asterisk) to `/*' and  ``\\*' to `*/'
     (Important for C compilers, that do   not allow nested comments,
     and this may happen, if you write down   C-comments within your
     autodoc).

`-s<id>'
     If you want to write the documentation in different languages, than
      you can specify a special ID, for which every autodoc entry gets
     checked.    If the entry matches the two character ID, than the
     autodoc gets extracted,   otherwise it won't get touched.    This
     special ID must be specified as the third and fourth character of
     the   beginning line of the autodoc.

                       Standard          Using ``GB'' as ID
                        1234567              1234567
          
          internal      ?****i*              ?*GB*i*
          usual         ?******              ?*GB***
          header        ?****h*              ?*GB*h*
          
          ? := any character

     E.g. you want to extract all autodocs written in german, so you
     could   use "DE" as ID for each german autodoc entry. Then you can
     call   `GAdoc' with the option "-sDE" and all autodocs that have
     "DE" will be extracted.

     Default is "**". This makes it easy for you to write multi-language
      autodocs and keep them together in one file.

`-amiga'
     Include amiga support for texinfo file

`-aicon'
     If this flag is specified, gadoc will create an icon with the name
     "<output>.guide.info". This file is only useful for people that
     do use an Amiga computer, otherwise the created icon will be
     worthless.   After creating the guide file with makeinfo, you will
     be able to use  the icon from workbench by just clicking on it and
     it will be loaded  into multiview (Workbench 3.0 required at
     least).

   The lines for the autodocs are limited to 80 chars/line.

   GAdoc reads the specified source file and generates two files with
the extensions .menu and .data. The file with the .menu extension is
considered to be the main part of the generated texinfo file.

The texinfo format
==================

   Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both on-line information and printed output.

   To produce on-line information like plain ascii text or hypertext
format, you need a program called makeinfo.

   It will generate a plain ascii file (Here: "output.doc"), if you
invoke it like that:

     makeinfo --no-headers -o output.doc output.menu

   If you want to generate a gnu infoview file, you should invoke
makeinfo with just the filename:

     makeinfo output.menu

   It will generate a file "output.guide", as this name is specified in
output.menu.

   If you want to generate amiga specific files, use the "--amiga"
flag, e.g.  to generate the amiga hypertext format for amigaguide:

     makeinfo --amiga output.menu

   To generate a .dvi file with TeX, just call virtex with the following
parameters:

     virtex output.menu

   Make  sure,  you have the texinfo includes available to use it with
virtex.  (If  you  use  a  special  amiga version, you need
amigatexinfo also, but I never needed it at all.)

Error messages
**************

``-xy': Specified twice (See argument # `n')'
     You specififed the parameter -xy twice.

`Unknown argument: <arg>'
     The argument <arg> that you specified in the command line is
     unknown   to GAdoc. Remeber that arguments with a minus ("-") are
     only accepted   in lower case letters.

`Could not open file ``<fname>''.'
     GAdoc could not open the requested file, maybe you should check its
      spelling (Some OS distinguish between lower case and upper case
     letters.)

`Error Line `n': Either keyword <key> used twice or in wrong order.'
     Maybe you did specify a keyword more then one time in one function
      description, or you used the keywords in wrong order.

`Error: End of file occured during internal docs.'
     Maybe you forgot the three asterisks to end this internal
     documentation.

`Error Line `n': Header specified after autodocs.'
     The header is to be specified before any other autodoc.

`Error Line `n': Second time header gets specified.'
     You did specify two header sections.

`Error: End of file occured during internal block.'
     During reading an autodoc for an internal function, an END OF FILE
      signal occured, maybe you forgot to specify the end marker.
