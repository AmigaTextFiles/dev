    Amiga Date Requester
    Mark R. Rinfret, 10/03/89

The contents of this package will provide you with 

    - AmigaDOS date support functions
    - A date requester which can be added to your programs.
    - A standalone ARexx-driven date requester program which can be
      called from ARexx macro files.
    - Some limited Intuition support functions required by this package.


The date requester module is dependent upon the ARP support library. The
arexx requester program requires that you have ARexx installed on your
system.


What it does -

    The MRDateReq module provides you with Intuition-based support for
soliciting a date value from the user. It supports both point-and-click
selection of date values and direct entry (typing) of the individual
components. All useful components of a date are available after the
request is satisfied.

    The RxDateReq module provides an ARexx execution framework for the 
date requester. At this time, it is not reentrant/shareable, but it can
be told the unique rexx port name to be used upon startup. The example
script, "test", illustrates one method for generating the unique port
name.

    The RxDateReq module works in three phases. First, certain parameters
are initialized using 'set' commands. Next, the date requester is
activated. At this time, program is under control of the date requester.
Finally, the results of the request can be polled using a variety of
'get' commands. As of this writing, the RxDateReq module responds to the 
following instructions:

'exit'

    Shut down the date requester.

'getdate'

    This command retrieves a formatted string representing the date
portion (year, month, day) of the user's response to 'request'. The
returned value will be found in the result variable. Be sure to use
"options results" in order to be able to retrieve the value.

'getformat'

    This command retrieves the current date format name and stores it in
the result variable. See 'setformat' for the possible name values
returned.

'getfulldate' <stem name>

    This command retrieves all date components in a compound variable
whose base name is <stem name>. In addition to the 6 components listed
under 'setfulldate', element 7 will contain an index for the day of the
week, where 0 = Sunday. Example:

    'getfulldate' "finaldate"
    say "The weekday index was " finaldate.7

'gettime'

    The time component of the current date value (hour,minute,second) is
retrieved as a formatted string and placed in the result variable.

'request'

    This command activates the date requester. The requester will remain
in control until the user selects either the OK or CANCEL gadget.

'setformat' "International" | "DOS" | "USA" | "Canadian"

    This sets the date presentation format. Note that only the unique
portion of one of the format names need be passed (e.g. "Int" or "I") in
order for it to be recognized.

'setfulldate' <stem name>

    This command allows the macro to preset a default date value. The
components of the date are expected to be in a compound variable whose
base name is <stem name>. Prior to calling 'setfulldate', the macro must
initialize the compound variable:

    defdate = 0
    defdate.1 = 1989    /* year */
    defdate.2 = 10      /* month */
    defdate.3 = 5       /* day */
    defdate.4 = 14      /* hour */
    defdate.5 = 20      /* minute */
    defdate.6 = 30      /* second */
    'setfulldate' defdate
    
'setprompt' <prompt string>

    This sets the prompt message that appears in the date requester. For
example:
            'setprompt' "Please select the date:"
