SetNewScreen							 SetNewScreen

    (void) SetNewScreen(ns, type, scr)
    NS *ns;		D0   D1    A0
    ulong type;
    SCR *scr;

    This function fills in the Width, Height, and Depth fields of the
    passed NewScreen structure according to the specified standard screen
    (ala GetScreenData()).  If you pass WBENCHSCREEN for the type you
    should pass NULL in scr.  If you pass CUSTOMSCREEN for the type you
    should pass a pointer to the custom screen in scr.

    Only those fields in the NewScreen which are ZERO (0) will be modified.

    ns->Width is set according to the specified standard screen and adjusted
    if the ns->ViewModes differs from the standard screen's viewmodes.  That
    is, if the standard screen is HIRES and the ns->ViewModes is not, the
    ns->Width will be set to half the standard screen's width.  The other
    side of the coin (standard screen is not HIRES and NewScreen is),
    ns->Width will be set double the standard screen's width.  If the
    viewmodes match the width is set exactly.

    ns->Height is set according to the specified standard screen and adjusted
    if the ns->ViewModes differs from the standard screen's viewmodes.  If
    ns->ViewModes specifies LACE and the standard screen is not, ns->Height
    will set to doubled the standard screen's height and vise versa (ns
    is not LACE and standard screen is, ns->Height is set to half).  If the
    viewmodes match the width is set exactly.

    If ns->Depth is zero and the CUSTOMBITMAP flag is set and the
    CustomBitMap pointer is not NULL, the depth will be set to the bitmap's
    depth.  Otherwise, if the ns->Depth is still zero it will be set to the
    specified standard screen's depth.

    This function calls GetScreenData()


GetStdWidth							  GetStdWidth

    short GetStdWidth()

    This function returns the width of the workbench screen in HIRES PIXELS.
    I.E. if you workbench screen is 702 across, 702 will be returned.  If
    you somehow have got a LOW-RES workbench screen which is, say, 320 pixels
    across, 640 will be returned.

    This function calls GetScreenData()


GetStdHeight							 GetStdHeight

    short GetStdHeight()

    This function returns the height of the workbench screen in
    NON-INTERLACED PIXELS.  I.E. if you have a non-interlaced workbench
    screen 320 pixels high 320 will be returned.  If you have an interlaced
    workbench screen 640 pixels high 320 will still be returned.

    This function calls GetScreenData()
