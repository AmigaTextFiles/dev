    These are general memory handling routines which will perform operations
    as quickly as possible.  They are super-optimized to use long word and
    multiple-register moves whenever possible.

BZero								    BZero

    (void) = BZero(buf, bytes)
    APTR buf;
    long bytes;

    Zero out an area of memory.  That was simple!  This is simply a special
    case of BSet()


BSet								    BSet

    (void) = BSet(buf, bytes, value)
    APTR buf;
    long bytes;
    long value; 	(only lower 8 bits used)

    Jam a byte value into an area of memory.


BMov								    BMov

    (void) = BMov(src, dest, bytes)
    APTR src, dest;
    long bytes;

    Move a block of memory from the source to the destination.	An
    ascending or decending copy is used depending on how the source and
    destination overlap, if at all.  Both are optimized to use multiple-
    register moves when possible, longword moves, or byte moves if the
    two blocks are hopelessly out of alignment.


BCmp								    BCmp

    BOOL   = BCmp(src, dest, bytes)
    APTR src, dest;
    long bytes;

    Compare two blocks of memory.  (1) is returned on success, (0) on
    failure.  Currently, this routine is not optimized at all.
