ReadMe.doc                                                (C)1994 P.D.Turner.

All the code on this disk is copyright.  It was all designed and written by
me, with the following exceptions...

   startup.o  -  The startup module.  The source is not supplied because of
                 copright, contact commodore for source or get RKMs.
                 (C)1988 Commodore-Amiga, Inc.

   apack.asm  -  IFF file compressor.  Used by SaveILBM routine to pack the
                 ILBM files.
                 (C)1988 Creative Focus.

The code on this disk is for your own use only.  I do not want anyone messing
about with it and then releasing The Designer V4.23 or whatever!

There are four modules you can use....

   LoadILBM         -  IFF ILBM file loader.
   SaveILBM         -  IFF ILBM saver.
   FileRequester    -  A File requester.
   PaletteRequester -  A palette requester.

You can use the object code of the above in your own stuff as long as you
give me a mention, and mention The Designer.  A guide to using each of these
modules can be found at the start of the source code for each module.


The "make" project is on this disk in a drawer called "Make" (wow!).
The file you should look at next is "Docs/Source.doc".  It contains info on
assembling The Designer, and also a dictionary of routines, this is a list of
all the routines in The Designer and what they do.
