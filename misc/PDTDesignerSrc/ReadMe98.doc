Read_Me_First.doc                                         (C)1998 P.D.Turner.


This the source distribution for a tile map editor for use by game
programmers, developed by me between 1992-98.

Get the main program archive (V2.15a) for all the proper instructions etc.

Yes I know, it's all been done before!  However, I still think this stands
up well when compared to other offerings.

Previously this was released as a cut-down version, upgradable via a
shareware registration fee.

I have now decided to release the full version onto Aminet, as well as this
68000 source code (see below).  Obviously, these can be downloaded for free,
but I will still accept all cheques, postal oreders, money-orders etc, made
payable to P D Turner, sent to the address at the end.

This is the 68000 source archive for V2.14 of The Designer available only via
Aminet.

It contains all source code and gfx data and is exactly the same as that
which I have used, with the following additions...


   A file to explain what all the modules are about and how to re-assemble
   them.
   
   A subroutine dictionary containing a description of each routine.
   
   An additional directory containing the source and executable of a small
   "make" program, which automates re-assembly.  (requires startup code)
   
And Exceptions!...

   No Amiga startup, or include files are included.  These are required
   to rebuild the main executable.  These are available from Amiga or with
   commercial language vendors.

Other Stuff, The Past, And the Future!!

Until recently I had been away from computers for "Personal" reasons,
however, now I have returned!

Another piece of software is a (semi) secure hard-disk login requester for
Amiga computers.
This is available as C source code only, since the password is hard coded
into the program.  People interesed in getting thier hands on this should 
email me at the address below, if enough people want it, it will be made
available.

I am currently working on a couple of possible projects (one game), these will
more than likely be dual Amiga / PC releases, further information will be
released at approriate times.



!!!! DISCLAIMER !!!!

Although I have tried to get everything right, I cannot guarantee anything
that has been said in any file on this distribution.  You use this program
at your own risk.  I will not be held responsible for any loss or damage
caused by the use of this or any other program.
