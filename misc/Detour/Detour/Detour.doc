	>> Detour <<


	Object  file  basing  on  this  source-code  is  for  the Maxon, HiSoft and
	eventually Storm (up to V3) compilers.

	When  encountering  compiler  errors  about unreferenced symbols it is very
	likely  that  the function which is unknown stays in a pragma-file and this
	pragma-file  isn't  understood  by the above stated compiler - respectively
	is for this compiler empty.

	This  occurs  often  when the original source-code was built for the SAS/C,
	VBCC or GNU-C compiler.

	Detour  does  now  nothing  else than to rename the original NDK pragmas to
	"..._old"  and  creates  a  file  -  with  only one line that says that the
	required file can be found at an other loaction.

	Usage:

	If you don't know what's going on, you can simply call Detour as follow:
		1> detour work:mcpp4.0/amiga/c-inc/pragmas          (as an example)
	Detour  will examine this specified directory accordingly for non-compliant
	pragmas  (from  Maxon,  HiSoft compiler point of view) and displays what it
	would do when calling in real.
	NOTE: No modification will be made at this stage of invoking.

	In order to let the modifications take place, you have to call it like this:
		1> detour work:mcpp4.0/amiga/c-inc/pragmas real
	The  "real"  statement  forces Detour to rename the standard- and to create
	new pragma-files in this directory.

	You can undo the made modifications by calling Detour so:
		1> detour work:mcpp4.0/amiga/c-inc/pragmas real revert

	In  this  case  (after  changes  have been applied) all will be put back to
	original state.


	A  simple  example.  Normally,  depending  on the compiler's type you would
	have  to  do the following in order to build a source-code that is readable
	under SAS/C, and MaxonC++ (HiSoftC++):

	#if !defined(__MAXON__)
	#include	<pragmas/exec_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/graphics_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/intuition_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/gadtools_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/dos_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/asl_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/wb_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/icon_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/diskfont_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/locale_pragmas.h>
	#include	<pragmas/rexxsyslib_pragmas.h>
	#else
	#include	<pragma/exec_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/graphics_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/intuition_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/gadtools_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/dos_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/asl_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/wb_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/icon_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/diskfont_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/locale_lib.h>
	#include	<pragma/rexxsyslib_lib.h>
	#endif

	Now, after Detour has modified these files, you can use this instead:

	#include	<proto/exec.h>
	#include	<proto/graphics.h>
	#include	<proto/intuition.h>
	#include	<proto/gadtools.h>
	#include	<proto/dos.h>
	#include	<proto/asl.h>
	#include	<proto/wb.h>
	#include	<proto/icon.h>
	#include	<proto/diskfont.h>
	#include	<proto/locale.h>
	#include	<proto/rexxsyslib.h>

	This  should  eleminated several problems to port code from one compiler to
	an other.
