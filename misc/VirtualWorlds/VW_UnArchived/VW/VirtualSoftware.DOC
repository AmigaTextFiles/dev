   PROGRAMS
   ========
      Virtual Worlds     V1.019
      ==============
      Available under dev/misc on aminet as VirtualWorlds.lha

         An adventure authoring system for which you need
         _NO_ programming knowledge to create worlds. Using
         an easy to use point and click interface, you can
         design an entire adventure without having to type
         in a single line of code.

   BLITZ ][ 'LIBRARIES'
   ====================
       VS-Includes
       ===========
       Available under dev/basic on aminet VS-Includes.lha
       
       Consisting of:

       TextEntry Library  V1.05
       =================
         An include file which provides a cute resizable
         text entry window which has multiple lines and a
         listview type operation to it. This is really handy
         and of course cute. This requires the Window
         Graphics library and elmorelib.

       ToolTypes Library  V1.01
       =================
         A small include file which allows Blitzers to
         access the ToolType Information contained within an
         icon.

       ASLRequestlib Library V1.01
       =====================
         Another small include file enabling Blitzers to
         bypass the crap ASLRequest Function in blitz, and
         to hit the library directly. This is necessary to
         avoid certain bugs in Blitz, and to enable some
         features not provided in the Blitz command.

       Window-Gfx V1.02
       ==========
         A small library that provides some handy window commands including
         those for adding and removing GadgetLists, and also redrawing
         entire GadgetLists in one go.  Other features include a few nice little
         additions to windows, such as the Final Copy II like outline. Needed
         for the TextEntry Library.

IBM CLONES (The scum that they are)
==========

   Virtual Ballistics   V1.00
   ==================
      A small utilty which was written as a first year
      physics project which produces plots of trajectories
      of particles that experience drag forces. Nothing
      special. This program received a mark of 100% from the
      Physics Computing Dept. at Birmingham University.
