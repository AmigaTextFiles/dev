                  =====================================

   Welcome to Virtual Worlds Help.  This help file has been opened such that
it is running concurrently with Virtual Worlds - i.e. you can nip back to
Virtual Worlds and try something and this help file will still be ready for
you.  To return to Virtual Worlds, click on the button in the top right hand
corner of the screen, and do the same again to return here. If you close the
file, then it can be reopened in the normal way.

   <WARNING> If you keep using the Virtual Worlds button to get help and
             do not close the help files, then you will end up opening
             several copies of this file!  This will take up memory so is
             inadvisable.

   Please note that if you are using a 1.3 machine then this help file will
appear corrupted.  This is merely due to accessing of newer functions that are
unavailable in KickStart 1.3, and will not impair the information contained in
the text.

@node "1_HARDWARE" "Virtual Worlds - Hardware Requirements"

   To run Virtual Worlds you will need at least 1 MB of memory.  However,
with 1 MB machines, this help file may not be accessible from within the
Virtual Worlds program.  A hard disk is recommended, but not required -
however a RAD: device will allow similar benefits when working on a World file
from such a device.

   Virtual Worlds requires KickStart 1.3 or greater to run.  However, the
interface was originally designed for WB2+, and the fact that it runs on
WB1.3 machines is an unexpected side-effect!  All features ARE accessible on
both versions, but may be accessed in a slightly different manner. Virtual
Worlds utilises the extra features available from 2.x upwards where
available.

   Please note - this help file is designed for WB2+.  On WB1.3 machines,
certain features (such as italics) do not appear to be shown correctly. As
such there may be a few 'misaligned' characters - these will not marr the
functionality or information contained within this document.

@endnode

@node "1_SOFTWARE" "Virtual Worlds - Software Requirements"

   The only software required to run Virtual Worlds is what is supplied in
the original archive.  Obviously, it requires the appropriate WorkBench
version, ie 1.3 or greater.

   Please note that the correct version of asl.library MUST be used for your
machine.  In the directory ASL are the 1.3 and 2.04+ libraries.  When Virtual
Worlds is run by booting from a disk created by the install program,  the
correct file is automatically selected for you.  However, if running from  a
hard disk or another boot disk, then the appropriate library MUST be present
in your Libs: drawer under the name of ASL.LIBRARY (as opposed to
ASL204.LIBRARY.  Virtual Worlds should then function correctly.

   It has been brought to my attention that the supplied asl.library does not
function correctly on the A3000.  If you already have a copy, please use
that. If not then try using either of the two supplied in this archive.

   Please do NOT distribute the program as the disk created with the install
program.  Virtual Worlds may ONLY be distributed in its original archive.

@endnode

@node "2_FLOPPY" "Virtual Worlds - Floppy disk users"

   Floppy disk users should use the install utility provided in the archive.
This will produce a fully working bootable disk from which Virtual Worlds
should run.  If you are booting from your own Workbench disk, you should
ensure that the appropriate files in the LIBS, L, S, and FONTS directory are
present on your boot disk.  The use of a RAD: device is recommended if
available, as this will reduce disk access times for the World files you are
working on.

@endnode

@node "2_HD" "Virtual Worlds - Hard disk users"

   Hard disk users should use the install program provided to set up Virtual
Worlds.  Please see the @{"software requirements" link "1_SOFTWARE" 0}.

@endnode

@node "3_INTRO" "Virtual Worlds - Introduction"

    Virtual Worlds has been designed to enable users to create large and varied
Worlds.  In simplest terms, Worlds are adventures.  However, this is a very
simple term, and doesnt really cover everything that Virtual Worlds can (or
will be able to) do.  A World is created through a simple point and click
interface, and is then played using the interpreter VWRun.  No programming
knowledge is actually required, all the hard work is already implemented for
you.

@endnode

@node "3_MENUS" "Virtual Worlds - Menu System"

   Virtual Worlds provides two types of menus for you to use.  All features
of Virtual Worlds are accessible from both, so there is no benefit of one
over the other, except for personal preference.
   The standard menu to be used with Virtual Worlds is a @{"Floating Menu" link "FLOATMENU" 0} which
can be positioned anywhere on the screen, and the appropriate options
selected from it.  This menu can be turned off using the @{"Preferences" link "3_PREFS" 0} section.
   The second menu type is the intuition style pull-down menus.  These are
always available and allow you to instantly access any feature of Virtual
Worlds.  These menus also have associated @{"keyboard shortcuts" link "KEYBOARDSHORTCUTS" 0}, which can be
used by the power-user to edit a World quickly and efficiently.


@endnode

@node "3_PREFS" "Virtual Worlds - Preferences"

   Virtual Worlds can be customised to your needs through this section of the
program.  From here, you can select whether to use a custom screen or the
currently open Workbench screen, and also choose whether you wish to use the
@{"floating menu" link "FLOATMENU" 0} system.

   From this options screen, you can also change the variable sizes used in
World file.  These only need to be changed if you have run out of places to
store your information (a requester will tell you when this happens). For
these options to work, you need to change them, and then select the save
option.  Now you will need to quit Virtual Worlds and reload, you should now
be able to continue with your World.

   If Virtual Worlds wont load after changing something here then bracket out
offending tooltypes and restart.  This will reset Virtual Worlds to its
default settings.  If a file is too large for the current variable size
settings, you will be informed and presented with the option to enlarge your
preferences settings to accomodate it.

@endnode

@node "4_COMMANDS" "Virtual Worlds - Commands"

   Within your world, the player needs to be able to make things happen,
otherwise it wouldn't be worth their while playing it!  Certain standard
functions are already handled for you, such as the picking up and dropping of
objects, and movement around the World.  Examinations of items is also built
in and you do not need to define these yourself.

   However, in certain situations, you will need other commands, such as PULL
for PULL THE LEVER, and USE when you wish to USE THE SCREWDRIVER ON THE CAT.
These extra commands will need to be defined by you.

   On the Command Editing Window, there are two lists, the first being a list
of all the commands you have defined, and the second being a list of all the
objects you have defined.  To add a new command, hit the Add Command gadget on
the right and enter a name for it such as USE.  It will be automatically
converted to uppercase.  Thats all there is to it.

@endnode

@node "4_OBJECTS" "Virtual Worlds - Objects"

   No World would be complete without actual objects.  These are the items
that the player can interact with, including immovable ones.  To add a new
object, hit the Add Object gadget and then enter a name for it.  Each object
may have a series of attributes, edited using the toggle gadgets on the
Object Name Window.  Any Object may either be movable or non-movable (as to
whether the player may pick it up), and may emit light, or be worn.

   In addition to these simple facets, an object may have objects inside or on
top of it, ie, a MUG may have a HANDLE on it, or a DESK may have a LAMP on it.
Or the MUG may have TEA in it.  These can all be provided for using the Items
In/On Windows.  The list on the left of this screen are all the objects
available, and the list on the right is all those in or on the object.  Items
may be added or removed via the two buttons in the centre.

   Possibly the most important gadget in this window in terms of understanding
its use is the 'Visible' gadget.  Obviously just about all your objects will be
visible in the literal sense, but here it is used in the sense that an object
which is visible will be mentioned whenever someone LOOKs at a room (and when
they enter it).  Also 'invisible' items will not be meentioned If they are in
the players inventory.  Standard procedure used to be that all 'Available' items
were 'visible' items, so this is the assumption when loading a file from pre
1.015 versions.  It is fairly good practice to keep to this convention, but
there may be some objects that you wish to have as visible, but not available. 
An example might be a magical sword that you cant pick up, but which is always
mentioned whenever you enter its locality.  Also, you might want an available
item to be hidden from immediate view, such as a loose brick in a wall. 
Remember that normally this would remain 'invisible' once picked up, so you may
want to add an effect to the GET LOOSE BRICK command that makes the brick
visible from then on.

@node "5_HISTORY" "Virtual Worlds - A not so brief history"

   Virtual worlds started out life as a little utility for myself that I
designed to help me create my own adventures in AMOS.  I then realised that
by fiddling with a few things, I could make an adventure creator, thus was
born ACS, Adveenture Creator System (the running system had the unfortunate
name of ARS) in Nov. 1988.  Around March 1989, I started giving ACS to my
friends, and slowly it grew.
   By the middle of 1990, ACS was beginning to look tacky.  It had undergone
so many revisions that it was on version 2.34 and rising rapidly. The
organisation of it all was awful, so I started again - on Inspiration.
   This was finished in Oct. 1990, and it looked a bit WB2.0 like, but not
the real thing (because AMOS is bloody crap - and I dont want to start
arguing with AMOS Pro fanatics - I have used BOTH and guess which I prefer?).
It then stayed pretty much the same, undergoing changes to take it to V1.36,
up until about Dec. 92.   'A' level exams came and went (3 A's by the way),
and I did nothing with Inspiration.  Nothing came of sending it to magazines,
but friends liked it (they would) so I was happy.
   Then Amiga Format came along in Nov. 93 and gave me Blitz2.  I was hooked.
I had played with C and Pascal, but I loved Blitz2.  I borrowed the whole
thing from a mate for a week, and wrote V1.000 of Virtual Worlds in that time
(ie menu system, windows, file stuff, a few editing things). So I forked out
the £50 and bought it myself, and haven't looked back since.
   Although I was at University (Physics at Birmingham), and I had very little
time to program, I started producing Virtual Worlds.  I bought an A1200 in 
January 94 and 2Megs of extra RAM in April 94, and produced the program you 
are hopefully finding at least slightly useful now.

@node "5_UPDATES" "Virtual Worlds - Update Information"

   Here is a record of updates made to Virtual Worlds in reverse order. (cos
I get _REALLY_ hacked off when I have to sit and wade through 100's of
updates to get to the latest info at the bottom!)

V1.018
======

ADDED: Support for Workbench Version command.
FIXED: Menus should now be (almost) style guide compliant.
FIXED: Loading a file which is too big now owrks as expected.
FIXED: Large file loading on startup bug removed.
FIXED: Help option now doesnt hang up VW.
FIXED: Effect editing window now details what effect is being edited.
FIXED: Bug on effect menu where a double click was required previously.
FIXED: Spurious operation of effect item selection.

V1.017   16/1/95
======

    All listviews should now work properly (in previous versions, some would not
allow you select items far down the list if you had enlarged the window).  When
adding Locations/Objects/Commands, you can no longer press the add gadget
repeatedly, then end up wading through millions of requesters when you run out
of space - you just get the one.  Also some more A500 compatibility was forced
in - VW runs more frequently and crashes less on my A500 - I honestly dont know
what the reasons for crashing are - I believe the problems are to do with
Blitz2.  Saved a bit more memory whilst running, but VW is still fairly memory
hungry, at last count you need 379K free to run it.

V1.016   10/1/95
======

    Fixed a bug in the menu window redraw routine which caused VW to crash
occasionally when changing screenmode.  CardSections are now removed from
preferences window when the option is selected.  Screen mode selector added for
WB3+ machines.  I _THINK_ that the TextEntry window problems should FINALLY be
eradicated, due to cheating andjust using the topaz font inside the window. 
Eradicated bug in effects window where strange things would occur if the last
command was deleeted.  All current effect commands may be edited.  Effect window
may now be resized with no risk of crashes.  Load/Save function now display
correct version number in window bar.  Tidied up screen names slightly.
Compressed the executable from 272K down to 88K!

    Also sorted out a few of the problems that had arisen on WB1.3 over the time
since I was last able to check it (V1.009!!!).  Surprisingly, most things still
work, but due to the new gadget handling, something goes wrong when redrawing
entire gadgetlists.  I have a suspicion this is a bug in Blitz2, do this may
well be fixed soon.

V1.015   6/1/95
======

    Fixed a rather obscure bug, whereby if you double clicked a location and
then hit the name option on the menu window, an item was removed from the list
of items in the room. Also fixed a very minor in the loading routines which
would only occur with non-VW files.  Added Visibility to objects.  Improved menu
window updates slightly using new routines.  Also added objects in rooms and
inventory maximums to the World files.

V1.014   1/1/95
======

    Thanks to finally sussing how to bypass the Blitz2 gadget commands and
access the Intuition library directly, a window no longer needs to be closed
and reopened in order to change its gadgets.  This greatly reduces the time
taken to change between editing windows, and also makes the resizing operation
far cleaner than it was.

V1.013   29/11/94
======

    Gadgets in the effects editing window now work.
    More stable thanks to (finally) receiving Blitz2 upgrades.
    Editing and menu window sizes and positions are now saved in your
preferences file.
    Text editing window now works as expected.
    Bug in loading help file fixed (i think).
    Author information now saved with the World files.
    First version released with a running system (minimal version).


V1.012   30/10/94
======

   Entire Interface is now screen font sensitive and will adapt itself to
(hopefully) produce good-looking windows.  Resizing of windows implemented
which was actually the main bulk of the changes made.
   CardSections implemented (similar to those in MicroShaft Excel) as an
'alternative' to menus, although they do not provide all possible menu
selections - don't actually work yet!
   DoubleClick detection now uses intuition Function which means that it
will conform to whatever it was set to in your Prefs and not an estimate
made by me.
   Locations and Objects Descriptions now use the new text entry window
rather than the cumbersome window used previously.  Appropriate menu items
have been removed.
   TextEntry window has now been updated to be completely font sensitive.
   A lot of work was done in the making of this version in terms of
investigating the possibility of modularisation of the program, ie different
modules for Monkey Island / EOB / Heimdall style adventures, and also for
population things.  Preliminary work has started on these ideas, and will
feature in a later version.
   Introduction of KeyFiles for registerred users.  This allows me to
distribute the latest versions freely, and any user can use them - those
who registerred get their advantages, and unregisterred still wont be
able to distribute their files without being blatantly obvious.  Ha Ha.
This means registerred users wont have to write to me and get updates direct-
If they get the latest full archive, then it will work as a registerred
for them, and not for others.
    MagicWB icon designed for those that use it.

V1.011  29/6/94
======

   Effects Implemented!!!  Finally you can actually edit something useful!
Okay, so theres only a few effects in this version, but more can easily be
added (and will be).  Feel free to suggest any new ones.
   An addition that could easily be missed is the new connection feature for
Location exits.  Double clicking on a roomname on the Location Exits Window
will not only set the specified direction to that room, but also the
corresponding direction in the other room will be set to the current room as
long as there is nothing already set for that direction.
   Shouldn't be any nasty Gurus when VW does decide to die - not that it ever
happened before of course ;).
   Also, you will be told if VW cannot find its Gfx file in the normal place,
the same applies to using the times font and the asl.library.
   Configuration information has been moved to the ToolTypes of the main icon.
Users of previous versions will have their S:VW.config files removed, and the
information saved in the tooltypes when they first run a more recent version.
   ASL File requester now opens on VW's custom screen and doesn't show any
.info files or .DAT files any more.  It will also stay in the same place that
you last closed it, and will also open onto the last used path.  Note that the
ASL requester works as an AppWindow - so you can drag the file/directory you
want into its window, and the path/filename will be duplicated for you.
   The option to expand your prefs will now open on the custom screen (if you
are using it), and will not exit if you decide not to change your prefs.  It
will also attempt to reload the file that you were editing.
   Install to floppy program finished and appears to work fine - Ill have to
let the public tell me of any configurations that protest...
   Minor problem in the corruption of the default effect text fixed.
   Quit/New/Load all ask for confirmation if the file has been edited since
the last save.  This only works for WB2+ cos I'm being lazy.  It will be done
for 1.3 in a future version.  And the check for changes only works on the
principle of a gadgethit/keypress/mousebuttonhit event occurring in the edit
window, so the requester may appear to pop up for no reason - sorry.

V1.010   30/5/94  
======

   Spurious operation of edit items on the prefs screen fixed from V1.009.
Use gadget no longer takes the Workbench's first four colours for the custom
screen.  Memory consumption reduced from 433K -> 344K (A whole 89K back!) for
a normal load (no file in memory).
   Oh, and a few spelling mistakes in the docs were corrected (for those
people who just love to find things wrong with my program ;} -> MW ).
   .DAT file protocol modified extensively for two reasons...
      1) It took up too much space before
      2) It was rather slow
   New protocol enables faster access and smaller files, and the data is now
more scrambled than ever, reducing the possibility of users tampering with
code.  One side effect of this is that any commands that you may have set as
special/default before will have lost this information, this is of no great
consequence as there was no real information stored there anyway before
V1.010, and all efects take the default anyway even if you do not define it.
   Menu operation is back to how it ought to be, effect window and menu
display is now implemented, but doesnt do anything!
   Bug whereby the loading window remained if loading failed part way through
has been removed - if the .DAT file was not of the right format/non-existent,
the loading window no longer floats around aimlessly.

V1.009   16/5/94  
======

   Floating menu now has a better 'feel' to it, and doesn't show wrong
information any more.  Choice between default+special effect implemented.
Double-click on Listview implemented in most cases :-

      o Command Name Window  o  Command List  -> Edit Normal Effect
                             o  Object List   -> Edit Combo. Effect
      
      o Object Name Window   o  Object List   -> Edit Object Description

      o Location Name Window o  Location List -> Edit Location Description

      o Putting objects into Object/Location
                             o  Left hand list  -> Add item
                             o  Right hand list -> Remove item

   Words in the Vocabularly can no longer be two words -> if two or more
words are entered then they are seperated and put into the list.

   Optimised save routine now cuts out all the references to effects which
contain no information.
   
   Addition of extra definitions for built in commands implemented.  (Only
GET and PUT at the moment - more will go in later versions).

   Naming of undefined items has been slightly changed to sound a bit more
'professional'.  Whatever next?

V1.008   12/5/94  
======

   Vocabulary bug fixed, intuition menus implemented (+shortcuts), object
editing moved around slightly.  A few minor bug fixes here and there.
ListView gadgets now have real-time update, and up/down arrows have continued
movement. Save as function implemented.  Option to remove the floating menu
implemented.

V1.007   27/4/94  
======

   Nearly finished - everything implemented apart from effects and population.
Vocabulary editing added (work has started on the interpreter and the parser
is finished.  Even more object support implemented, and you can finally put
objects in rooms.  Colours all go to nice WB2+ colours in the custom screen as
they were supposed to, and the annoying effect that WB1.3 machines get with
buttons (all reversed) is put straight in the CUSTOM screen mode.  (AFAIK)

V1.006  
======

   Realized that Virtual Worlds actually worked on an A500!  Fiddled with a
few things, such as the ASL file requester so that it worked happily with
WB1.3.

V1.005  
======

   More Object support added, Location work completed.  Text editor sped up.

V1.004  
======

   First version sent out for testing/evaluation.  Had lots of bugs in still.

V1.000-V1.003  
=============

   Prototype versions.  V1.003 was the first version to grace anyone elses
Amiga.  V1.000 was written in my first week of using Blitz2, and contained
all the menu, window,gadget handling, and command editing, all of which have
only changed minimally since (except after V1.010 where the menu system was
completely fixed).

@node "5_COMPATIBILITY" "Virtual Worlds - Known Compatibility"

   As far as I know, the following versions of Virtual Worlds works on....

 Version |  Machine | Chip Mem/K | Fast Mem/K | WB Version | Hard Disk/MB

  1.006  |  A600    |    2048    |     0      |     2.01   |     0

Known Problems  
==============

   On A3000's, the ASL.LIBRARY does not work for WB2.04 as intended.  If you
already have a copy, please use that - if not use the other one provided.

   On A500s, if there is to be an edit window opened with a proportional gadget
in it, then VW will more than likely crash.  I believe that this may well be
down to a bug in Blitz Basic 2, and it not setting the NEWLOOK flag correctly.

   Also VW will not always run on an A500 - this is a very hit and miss bug, and
I believe it is yet ANOTHER bug in Blitz2, possibly due to incorrect accesing
of libraries.

be copied and distibruted FREELY.  Anyone who finds this  program useful
should @{"REGISTER" link "REGISTRATION" 0}.  Only persons who have registered may release the World
files created by Virtual Worlds so that  they are available to the public (ie
Public Domain/Shareware).

   The editor and interpreter may be distributed freely ONLY as supplied in 
      the original archive.  See @{"ARCHIVE CONTENTS" link "ARCHIVE" 0}
   The interpreter may be distributed along with a World file by registered
      users only.  Registerred users should refer to their license agreement
      for more details.

   The distribution of ANY file CREATED by Virtual Worlds (ie your World), is
strictly ILLEGAL if you have not registered -> If you dont register and start
distributing your adventure then you are breaching copyright and BREAKING THE
LAW.  I can and will follow up EVERY incident that I find of this behaviour.

   This applies in kind to PD distribution companies in part.  As a PD
distributor, you must gain written permission from me before distributing ANY
part of Virtual Worlds _OTHER_ than the original archive.  This applies to
magazines (paper AND disk based).  The original archive may be freely
distributed by any means, including BBS's, <>< Disks, CoverDisks, etc.

@node "REGISTRATION" "Virtual Worlds - REGISTRATION"

   Virtual Worlds is Shareware.  This means that you can copy it and pass it
around to all your mates (please do!) as long as it is distributed as
supplied in the original archive.  See @{"Archive Contents" link "ARCHIVE" 0} If you  find it useful
then send the registration form to me (print it out or copy it out (it doesn't
need to be EXACTLY the same!)).  The form is in the file RegistrationForm in
this directory.  In any Case contact :-

                  37 Norfolk Road

   Registerred users will not only receive the latest version, but also several
demonstration adventure files, a document which takes you through making an
adventure in easy to follow steps. These can be ordered separately - the main
program costs £10, but the Standard Pack is £15. See the registration form for
more details.  Also a manual detailing the use and distribution of the
Interpreter will be included. Your registerred version will be personalised, and
when the adventure is run using the interpreter, your name will be displayed as
the author for any Worlds saved with your copy. Normally the author would be
quoted as unknown, and a requester saying that it was produced on an
unregisterred version would appear. This requester does not appear for licensed
World files.  There may also be a decent manual available for VW at some point
if enough people ask about it.

   Worlds created with Virtual Worlds may NOT be distributed UNLESS you have
registerred, and I have been informed that you will be distributing it.  See
@{"Copyright notice" link "COPYRIGHT" 0} for details.

   NB: Anyone registerring now will recieve the latest version and their
   keyfile.  Anything that is not complete at this stage, such as the tutorial,
   will forwarded as soon as it is available.

@node "WORLD" ""

   A world is the region which you are creating.  It need not be a complete
definition of an entire world, but a small region in which your adventure
takes place.  Worlds are defined using @{"locations" link "LOCATION" 0} and @{"objects" link "OBJECT" 0}.  Inhabitants of
your world are your @{"population" link "POPULATION" 0}. The way that the player interacts with the
world is defined by @{"commands" link "COMMAND" 0} which are defined using @{"effects" link "EFFECT" 0}.

@endnode

@node "COMMAND" ""

   A command is a command that the user can enter when playing the game.

@endnode

@node "OBJECT" ""

   An object is something the user can manipulate within the game.

@endnode

@node "LOCATION" ""

   Where the user can permeate (exist).

@endnode

@node "EFFECT" ""

   Defines how the user can interact with certain items.

   Commands can be added by selecting a new one from the list on the left.
This will insert the required command with null information.
   To insert or delete a line, click on the current commands image at the
top. To edit a commands parameters, click on the appropriate part of the top
bar, ie if it says

   Move <person> to <Location>

   click on the location bit to edit that.  If there is only one parameter
then you can click anywhere on that bar.  If there are no parameters to be
edited, or they are not implemented yet, then the current screen will be
beeped.
