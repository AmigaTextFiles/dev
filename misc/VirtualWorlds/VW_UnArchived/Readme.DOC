Hello!

      Heres a few notess you might want to read before you do anything else.

           o To install Virtual Worlds onto a hard disk OR a floppy disk
             then you should use the install utility provided.  This will
             place everything you need onto your hard drive in the correct
             place as pertained by you.  For floppy users, a self-booting
             disk will be created provided that :-
                     This archive has been unarchived onto a floppy that
                     is not called VW, and that you have a spare blank floppy
                     disk on which to install Virtual Worlds.
             EVERYTHING that came out of the archive can be deleted if you
             want because EVERYTHING will have been set up for you.
             The Installer program is provided for you - I dont know how many
             people have this, but certainly people without hard drives are
             unlikely to possess it.
             Otherwise...
              o If you want icons saved with data files then bung the VWProject
                icon into your s: drawer.
              o Put VirtualWorlds + VW.gfx in a drawer and assign VW: to it.
              o If you dont have a times font or yours doesnt like Virtual
                Worlds then copy the times font from the font draw.
              o If you dont have asl.library then copy the correct version
                to your libs: drawer -> call it ASL.LIBRARY.
                Also -> check that you dont already have a newer version number!
           o The online help will only work if AmigaGuide or MultiView is in
             your sys:utilities drawer.  (AmigaGuide is available on Aminet
             in a fish disk somewhere.)
           o ASL.LIBRARY MUST be present in LIBS: to run Virtual Worlds.
           o Floppy disk users should boot from a copy of Workbench, ensuring
             that an appropriate version of ASL.LIBRARY is in the libs drawer
             of your boot disk.  Final version will be supplied as an archive
             that can install itself to a boot disk.
           o PLEASE let me know if you let anyone else use VW, and PLEASE give
             me a bit of feedback - if you detest VW then TELL ME!  I need to
             know what you like and dislike so I can make any progress.
           o Give me some kind of report (if you can) including :-

                  Machine Running On
                  KickStart Version
                  AGA/ECS/OLD Gfx Chipset
                  Free Mem + Fast Mem
                  Hard Disk size

             And say whether it works of course!  A quick mention of things
             you like/dislike/want would be greatly appreciated.
             If you have found a bug before and its still there - tell me 
             again!  I have a mind like a sieve, so keep reminding me if its
             not been sorted out!  >BUG ME IF VW IS BUGGING YOU<


   Everything else is pretty much self explanatory, but I ought to mention what
ISNT in there so that you dont come running back and complain about it!

      ALL THESE WILL GO IN AT SOME POINT :-

   Effects - More _WILL_ be added including If stuff and
   variables and the Interface option in conjunction with
   the interpreter Exits opened/closed then I add the
   population. Then Ill make it so you can do Monkey Island
   style things. This is now damn-near definite - It wont be
   done quickly, but I think I can... It may be more Virtual
   Theatre style (V1 - Lure of the Temptress)

   Feel free to suggest anything you feel I have missed / should include.
There is a large possibility of an in-line editor as well at a later date.
