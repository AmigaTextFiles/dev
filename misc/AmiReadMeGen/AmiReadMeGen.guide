@NODE "Contents"  "AmiReadMeGen (c) documentation:"

   @{B}AmiReadMeGen@{UB} is a GUI for generating readme files for any
   Amiga-related files you Upload to Aminet.
   
   Here is a list of the help available for this program:

   @{" Startup       " LINK "startup"} -- Running the System. 
   @{" Requirements  " LINK "requirement"} -- What do you need?
   @{" Configuration " LINK "DiskConfig"} -- Directory Storage. 
   @{" Warranty      " LINK "warranty"} -- (Are you kidding?) 
   @{" Distribution  " LINK "distribution"}
   @{" ToolTypes     " LINK "tooltypes"} -- Hurray, Someone who uses them!
   @{" Author        " LINK "Author"} -- Who is this Guy?

   @{" Logo          " LINK "AmiReadMeGen.bsh/main"} -- The program Logo.

@ENDNODE

@NODE "startup" "Running the system:"
@PREV Main

  The AmiReadMeGen program is invoked by typing the command @{B}AmiReadMeGen@{UB}
  or by clicking on the AmiReadMeGen icon.

  The program will open its own windows on the workbench.  Using the 
  @{" ToolTypes " LINK "ToolTypes"} stored in the icon, the program will 
  load whatever constant information is specified by the ToolTypes.

  After the program is done setting up, the @{"Logo" LINK AmiReadMeGen.bsh/main}
  is displayed.  By pressing & releasing the START! button the title will 
  close & the main GUI window will open, where you can add, modify or 
  delete the contents of any readme files.

  The program consists of the following CanDo (c) cards:
  
  @{" TitleCard " LINK "titlecard"} -- The Logo Display window.   
  @{" MainCard  " LINK "maincard"} -- Where you'll spend most of your time.
  
  @{" ToolTypesEditor " LINK "ToolTypesEditor"} -- Change the ToolTypes.

  SEE ALSO @{" Help Conents " LINK "Contents"} 

@ENDNODE

@NODE "TitleCard" "The Logo Display window:"
@PREV startup

   This window displays my program @{"logo" LINK AmiReadMeGen.bsh/main} until you press &
   release the START! button @{FG SHINE}(how groovy!)@{FG TEXT}.

   This is where the ToolTypes set-up the program.

   SEE ALSO @{" Help Conents " LINK "Contents"} 

@ENDNODE
   
@NODE "MainCard" "Where you'll spend most of your time:"
@PREV startup

   This window is the main GUI for running the program.  From here you
   can enter, modify or delete information.
   Most of the gadgetry is self-explanatory, except that some fields are
   considered mandatory by Aminet.  These string gadgets are in a different
   color of text for their labels.

   @{" Menus " LINK "MainMenus"} -- What do the menus do?
 
   SEE ALSO @{" Help Conents " LINK "Contents"} 

@ENDNODE

@NODE MainMenus "Menu items on the MainCard:"

   Menu items available are:

@{FG SHINE}   PROJECT @{FG TEXT}

      |- @{" SaveAs " LINK "SaveAsMI"} - Rename the readme file.
      |- @{" Quit   " LINK "QuitMI"} - Quit the Program.
      |
      |- @{" About..  " LINK "aboutinfo"}

@NODE "CallExtEditor" "Use an External Editor on your readme file:"

   AmiReadMeGen will send everything displayed to the filename given.
   
   Then it will start your External Editor (See @{" DefaultEditor " LINK "ToolTypes"}).
   
   You will then have to select the Load menuitem to get your changes back
   into the display gadgets.
    
@ENDNODE

@NODE LoadMI "Load a readme file:"

   This menuitem will load the specified file into the program's memory,
   then update the display to reflect the contents of the file given.

@ENDNODE

@NODE SaveMI "Save the entered information:"

   This menuitem will save the display contents into the filename you 
   entered into @{B}FileName:@{UB}

   See Also, the
   @{" Save As.. " LINK "SaveAsMI"} menuitem.

@NODE SaveAsMI "Rename the readme file:"

   This menuitem will Bring up a system file requester so that you may
   select a filename to use in order to save the display contents
   Other than that, it performs identically to the @{" Save " LINK "SaveMI"} menuitem.
   
@ENDNODE

@NODE HelpMI "How you got here:"

   Selecting this menuitem will open this AmigaGuide file so that you
   can figure out what you're doing (hopefully).

@ENDNODE

@NODE QuitMI "Exit the program:"

   @{B}AmiReadMeGen@{UB} is smart enough to ask you to save your data before it

   when you're using it. @{FG TEXT}
@ENDNODE

@NODE aboutinfo "Brief information Requester:"

   This Requester just displays some brief information about the Program 
   itself.
   
@ENDNODE
  
@NODE ToolTypesEditor "Change the ToolTypes:"
@PREV startup

   This window allows you to change the ToolTypes that the program uses
   in configuring itself.  You have to select the @{B}Save@{UB} menuitem in order
   for any changes you've made to be stored in the icon.  Clicking on the
   @{B}Cancel@{UB} gadget or the window's @{B}Close@{UB} gadget will return you to either
   the @{" MainCard " LINK "maincard"} without changing the ToolTypes.

   The @{B}Restore@{UB} menuitem will reset the List of ToolTypes to the ToolTypes
   stored in the icon.
       
   See Also,
   @{" ToolTypes " LINK "tooltypes"}

@ENDNODE

@NODE DiskConfig "File System Configuration:"
@PREV Main

  This is the layout of the AmiReadMeGen environment that you need to have
  in order to suppress un-wanted requester activity:
  
  @{FG SHINE}
  AmiReadMeGen            -- The main program.
  AmiReadMeGen.info       -- The main program icon.
  @{FG TEXT}

  @{"AmiReadMeGen.bsh" LINK AmiReadMeGen.bsh/main}    -- (The Program Logo, DO NOT rename this!)

  AmiReadMeGen.guide      -- This file.
  AmiReadMeGen.guide.info

  AminetTypes.txt -- A List of the different directories in the 
                     Aminet system (see @{" ToolTypes " LINK "ToolTypes"}).
                     You will have to update this file yourself if there
                     are any changes to Aminet or if the file is in error.

   @{B}REQUIREMENTS
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~@{UB}
   AmiReadMeGen uses DeckBrowser which is Copyrighted (c) by InovaTronics.
   I've included a copy of it with my distribution.  It should be placed
   in the command path where the Amiga OS can find it (example: @{B}C:@{UB})
   If you have cando.library or the CanDo! (c) program, you can use
   AmiReadMeGenSmall (see the .readme file) along with DeckRunner instead.

   The following fonts are used by AmiReadMeGen (if present):
   
       Helvetica - 13
       Times     - 24
       Topaz     - 8
       
   68000 or better microprocessor.

@NODE distribution "AmiReadMeGen distribution:"
@PREV Main

   @{B}DISTRIBUTION
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~@{UB}
   This software package is @{B}ShareWare@{UB}. It may be put on any
   media which is used for the distribution of ShareWare, like Public
   Domain disk collections, CDROMs or FTP servers.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package, distributors
   should use the complete original distribution. The author cannot be held
   responsible if this software has become unusable due to modifications
   of the distribution contents or of the distribution files themselves.
   There is no limit on the costs of the distribution, e.g. for the media,
   like floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact disks, or the process of
   duplicating.  Such limits have been proven to be harmful to the idea of
   shareware, i.e., instead of reducing the price of the
   floppy disk below the limit, the software was simply removed from the
   master disk.

   Although the @{" Author " LINK Author} does not impose any limit on the 
   distribution of this software, he would like to express his personal 
   opinions on this matter:

   * This software package should be made available to everyone free of
     charge whenever it is possible (so they can send me money instead ;)).

   * If you have acquired this software package under normal conditions
     from a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk at a price higher than
     US $5, then you have definitely paid too much.  Please don't
     support this improper profit making any longer and switch to a
     less expensive source as soon as possible.
