  Please note that this AmigaGuide file uses Version 39 formatting 
  commands. If you are using an earlier version of AmigaGuide all 
  bold commands will be shown as a white | character (at least under 
  version 37). So if you see something like |text| it is bold under 
  version 39. This is still quite readable if you dont have version 
  39 or above.

@{b}@{u}INTRODUCTION@{ub}@{uu}

  RCSGUI is as the name sounds like, a GUI for RCS. It of course 
  does not include RCS. It @{"requires" link "Requirements"} HWGRCS. 
  
  I decided to start using RCS instead of copying old versions 
  to another directory, or archiving it in a lha file. I down-
  loaded it from Aminet, installed it, and played around with it 
  a little. At first it seemed very nice (I still think it is), 
  but since I have the SAS/C compiler, which have very nice 
  workbench support, which I prefer using over using it from CLI, 
  it became very irritating having to open a shell to check my 
  files in and out of RCS. Since the icons for my source files 
  were still left it was very hard to se if a file was checked 
  out or not, and if it was locked. 
  
  I started dreaming, thinking that it would be nice if I could 
  have files checked in and out by just draging and dropping the 
  icons. I started playing with this idea, and RCSGUI was born.

@{b}@{u}FEATURES@{uu}@{ub}

  RCSGUI implements the basic features of RCS: checking in, checking 
  out, locked and unlocked, rlog, and rcs -n to assign a symbolic 
  name to a rev. It does not implement all options to all RCS 
  commands.
  
  
  @{b}Available in previous version (1.41):@{ub}

  Checkin in by drag and drop.
  
  Checkout with double click or checkout button.

  Lock/nolock selection for checkin and checkout.
  
  Completely font sensitive GUI. The control panel buttons and the
  icons will be distributed according to window size.
    
  All @{"configuration" link "InstallConfig" 0} can be done in the @{"tooltypes" link "InstallConfig" 18} of the icon.
  Some of the parameters can also be saved with the snapshot button
  in the window. (Button was previously called SSP).

  Shows all rcs operations in a console window.

  Uses separate repositories for files and icons. (Icons are actually
  not checked in under RCS, they are just kept in a directory).

  @{b}Features added in 2.41:@{ub}
  
  Checkout by drag and drop.
  
  Double click will also edit or view the file after checkout.
    
  Separate lock/nolock selection for checkin and checkout. (usually
  you want nolock on checkin, but lock on checkout). 
    
  The state of the toggle gadgets are also saved on snapshot.

  If the window isn't big enough to hold all icons, a scrollbar
  will be shown.

  Can now hide or show the rcs operations in the console window with
  the Verbose/Quiet toggle button.

  Will create icons in the icon repository for files that doesn't have
  any icons there. Useful when you use RCSGUI on an old RCS repository.

  Uses HWGRCSs RCS_link feature. (Now actually @{"requires" link "Requirements" 0} HWGRCS).
  Also implements an RCSGUI_link for the icon repository.
    
  Will let you specify repository dirs with a file requester if no 
  _link files are found in currect directory. The _link files will
  then be created.
  
  Support for suffix (-x option to the rcs commands).

  You can set the background color to use for both the icon part of
  the window and the control panel.  
  
  It works nicely with the SAS/C WB compiler environment, but have 
  no connection to the SAS/C compiler. It can be used with any 
  compiler that lets you edit & compile from the workbench. (Well, 
  it can be used with any CLI based compiler too, but it wouldn't 
  make sense). 
  
  It can actually be used with anything that you use RCS for (source,
  code, pictures, music, documents, anything you want to keep several 
  revisions of).
  
  @{b}2.42:@{ub}
  
  No new features, just a small fix: All libraries opened are now closed
  on exit.

@{b}@{u}REQUIREMENTS@{ub}@{uu}

  RCSGUI was written on an Amiga 4000/030 with AmigaDos 3.0 
  (version 39), but should work on any Amiga with AmigaDos 2.04 
  (version 37) or above. It might even work on 2.0 (version 36), 
  but it uses some functions that are described as buggy under 
  version 36. 
  
  @{"HWGRCS" link "RCS:readme.guide/Main"} is now @{b}required@{ub}! RCSGUI is based on HWGRCS patch
  level 11, but might work with earlier patch levels. HWGRCS is
  available on AmiNet.

@{b}@{u}INSTALLATION / CONFIGURATION@{uu}@{ub}

  Copy the rcsgui executable anywhere you want. The icon is a 
  project icon and should have the default tool point to whereever 
  you copy rcsgui. The icon should be put in each directory where 
  you have stuff that you want to checkin to RCS. If you are using 
  SAS/C I suggest that you put the icon under SC:starter_project. 
  Then whenever you run SCSetup, it will be copied along with the 
  other icons. 
  
  The following tooltypes are available:
  
  RCSHOME have been removed since HWGRCS requires RCS: to be 
  assigned to the bin directory of the HWGRCS installation. RCSGUI 
  will also use RCS:.

  @{b}REPOSHOME=@{ub}directory
     
     This is just a suggested path that will be put in the file
     requester when RCSGUI is started in a new directory without
     any RCS_link file. If this is commented out an RCS directory
     in the current directory will be suggested. If you have all
     your repositories in one place, point REPOSHOME there.

  @{b}SUFFIX=@{ub}suffix
     
     This is the suffix to use on the files in the RCS repository.
     -x<suffix> will be passed to ci, co, and rcs.

  @{b}EDITOR=@{ub}editor
  
     This is the editor to use for editing log messages. Default 
     is ED.
     
  @{b}VIEWER=@{ub}viewer
  
     This is the viewer to use for RLog output. Default is 
     SYS:Utilities/More.

  @{b}CILOCK=@{ub}LOCK or NOLOCK
     
     This is the status that the CILock/CINoLock toggle button 
     will be started with. This tooltype is modified by the 
     SnapShot button in the window.
      
  @{b}COLOCK=@{ub}LOCK or NOLOCK
     
     This is the status that the COLock/CONoLock toggle button 
     will be started with. This tooltype is modified by the 
     SnapShot button in the window.
      
  @{b}QUIET=@{ub}TRUE or FALSE
     
     If TRUE the Quiet/Verbose toggle button will be set to Quiet,
     and if FALSE to Verbose. This tooltype is modified by the 
     SnapShot button in the window.
  
  @{b}SPACEICONSEQUAL@{ub}
     
     If this tooltype is specifed all icons will be alligned with 
     the space between them set by the largest icon. This looks 
     much nicer, but takes more space. 
     
  @{b}BGCOLOR=@{ub}color
     
     This is the color to use for the background of the icon part 
     of the window. Default is color 0.
     
  @{b}ICONTEXTCOLOR=@{ub}color
     
     This is the color to use for the icon name label text.
      
  @{b}CONTROLCOLOR=@{ub}color
     
     This is the color to use as background in the control panel. 
     Note that this does not affect the color of the control panel 
     buttons.
     
  @{b}WINDOWWIDTH=@{ub}width
  
     The window will be opened with this width if specified. Default 
     350. This tooltype is modified by the SnapShot button in the 
     window.
     
  @{b}WINDOWHEIGTH=@{ub}heigth
     
     The window will be opened with this height if specified. Default 
     200. This tooltype is modified by the SnapShot button in the 
     window.
  
  @{b}WINDOWTOPEDGE=@{ub}topedge
  
     The window will be opened with its top edge at this position. 
     Default is to let intuition place it. This tooltype is modified 
     by the SnapShot button in the window.
     
  @{b}WINDOWLEFTEDGE=@{ub}leftedge 
  
     The window will be opened with its left edge at this position. 
     Default is to let intuition place it. This tooltype is modified 
     by the SnapShot button in the window.
     
  For @{b}WINDOWTOPEDGE@{ub} and @{b}WINDOWLEFTEDGE@{ub} both have to be set for it to 
  work. Otherwise Intuition will place the window.

@{b}@{u}OPERATION@{uu}@{ub}

  When RCSGUI starts up, it makes the directory where the RCSGUI 
  icon you clicked on to start it resides the current directory. 
  The RCS_link file is then checked if it exists. If it exists 
  the first line is read to get the repository directory. If it 
  doesn't exist an RCS directory in the current directory will be 
  checked if it exists.If so it will be used. Otherwise a file 
  requester will be shown asking for RCS repository directory. 
  If the directory specified doesn't exist it will be created. An 
  RCS_link file will also be created then. Then the same prodedure 
  is done for the icon repository, but replacing RCS_link with 
  RCSGUI_link, and the RCS directory in the current directory with 
  RCSGUIIcons. 
  
  If no icon is found for a file in the icon repository, or if a
  file without an icon is checked in, an icon will be created.
  ENV:sys/def_<extension>.info will be used as icon if it exist,
  otherwise the default project icons will be used.
  
  The title of the window contains "RCSGUI <version> Dir: <dirname>" 
  where <version> is the version of RCSGUI, and <dirname> is the 
  name of the directory where the RCSGUI icon you clicked on to 
  start it resides. You can only check in files from this directory, 
  and checkout to this directory. 
  
  On top of the window you have the "control panel". It is a set of 
  10 buttons, and one string gadget.
  
  The following "control panel" gadgets are available:
  
  @{b}[All]  [None]  [CILock/CINoLock]  [COLock/CONoLock]  [Verbose/Quiet]
  [Checkout]  [RLog]  [SymName]  [string gadget]  [SnapShot]  [About]@{ub}
     
  Click @{"here" SYSTEM "rcsgui >CON://500/100/RCSGUI_Demo_output/CLOSE/AUTO"} for a demo. The icons for the files in the current 
  directory will be displayed, and no operations will be done.
  
     @{b}All@{ub}

        Selects all icons in the window.
  
     @{b}None@{ub}
     
        Unselects all icons in the window. Clicking anywhere in 
        the window where there is no icon or gadget will also 
        unselect all icons, just like in a WB window.
    
     @{b}CILock/CINoLock@{ub}
  
        This is a toggle button. The state of this button affects 
        checkin. If CILock then @{"ci" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/CI"} -l <...>  will be done on checkin,
        otherwise @{"ci" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/CI"} -u <...> will be done.
        
     @{b}COLock/CONoLock@{ub}
        
        This is a toggle button. The state of this button affects 
        checkout. If COLock @{"co" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/CO"} -l <...> will be done on checkout, 
        otherwise @{"co" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/CO"} <...> will be done.

     @{b}Verbose/Quiet@{ub}
        
        This is a toggle button. If set to Quiet -q will be added 
        to each @{"rcs command" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/Main"}. If set to Verbose the output of each
        @{"rcs command" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/Main"} will be displayed in a console window. Note 
        that if set to Quiet any errors will still be displayed in 
        the console window. No output is redirected to NIL: by 
        RCSGUI. This button only sets the -q flag.

     @{b}Checkout@{ub}
     
        This button will checkout all selected icons. See checkout
         below for more info on checkout.     
                
     @{b}RLog@{ub}
  
        This wil run @{"rlog" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/RLOG"} on the selected files/icons. The result 
        will be displayed with the viewer you specified in the 
        @{"VIEWER" link "InstallConfig" 35} @{"tooltype" link "InstallConfig" 17}.
                
     @{b}SymName@{ub}
     
        This will assign a symbolic name to all the selected files
        The name should be specified in the string gadget. @{"rcs" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/RCS"} -n
        <string gadget> will be done. No ":" will be automatically 
        added to the name. Therefore you can also use this to remove
        a symbolic name. See @{"RCS docs" link "RCS:/readme.guide/Main"} for more info.
 
     @{b}string gad@{ub}
  
        The text in the string gadget is used by checkin, checkout, 
        and symname.
                
     @{b}SnapShot@{ub}
  
        This button will save the window size and position, and 
        the state of the 3 toggle buttons in the icons tooltypes.

     @{b}About@{ub}
        
        This will bring up an about requester. It contains the 
        RCSGUI version, my name and address, both the RCS and 
        icon repository paths, and the number of files checked 
        in.
                
  @{b}Checkin@{ub}
  
     There is no button for checkin. Checkin is done by dragging 
     and dropping the file you want to checkin on the window. The 
     editor will then be brought up to edit the log message. Checkin 
     looks both at the state of the CILock/CINoLock button, and the 
     string gadget. If the string gadget is empty "ci <file>" will 
     be done, and rcs will bump the revision from the old revision. 
     If a rev is specified in the string gadget @{"ci" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/CI"} -r<string gadget> 
     will be done. If the CILock/CINoLock button is set to CILock, 
     -l will also be added to the command. This will cause RCS to 
     immediately checkout the file with a lock again after checking 
     it in. RCSGUI will then only copy the icon to the RCSGUIIcons 
     dir, and not remove it from the current dir. 
  
     PLEASE NOTE that no verification of the path is done on a drop-
     ped file, you can checkin a file from any directory! Checkouts 
     however can only be done to the current directory (the directory 
     RCSGUI was started from).
  
  @{b}Checkout@{ub}

     There are 3 ways to checkout a file:
     
        If you want to checkout several files at the same time, 
        you have to select the files, and then press the checkout 
        button.
        
        Double clicking on an icon will check the file out, and
        also bring it up in the editor if COLock otherwise the
        file will be brought up in the viewer.
     
        Dragging an icon and dropping it somewhere outside of RCSGUIs
        window will checkout that file. Since the workbench doesn't 
        support drag and drop from an application, only to it, there 
        is no way for RCSGUI to know if it was dropped on a workbench 
        window, and if so what the path to that window is. So dropping 
        anywhere outside of RCSGUIs window is considered an OK drop. 
        You have to drag an icon at least 5 pixels in any direction 
        before it is registered as a drag. This decrease the chance 
        of accidentally starting a drag when trying to double click.

     Files will always be checked out to the directory that RCSGUI 
     was started from (which was set to the current directory on 
     startup). 
     
     The checked out file(s) will be locked or not locked depending 
     on the state of the COLock/CONoLock button. Icons will only be 
     checked out if the file is locked. This makes only locked files 
     visible on the workbench (if you dont do show all).

     If the string gadget is empty @{"co" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/CO"} <...> will be done otherwise
     @{"co" link "RCS:/man/rcs.guide/CO"} -r<string gadget> <...> will be done.

  RCSGUI will open a console window for the output of the ci, co, 
  and rcs commands. This console window is of type AUTO/WAIT. That 
  means that it wont open until there is output in it, and wont 
  dissappear until it is closed with the close button. This console 
  window is acutally a built in feature of the SAS/C compiler. If 
  you set the Verbose/Quiet button to Quiet no output will be gene-
  rated by the rcs commands, and the console window will never open, 
  unless there is an error.

  If you get more icons than will fit in the window, a scrollbar
  will be shown. This scrollbar @{u}does not@{uu} scroll rows! It scrolls 
  icons. For example, say you have 9 files checked in. The window 
  contains 6 icons. That means that 3 icons are not visible. The 
  scrollbar can be moved 8 (total-1) positions. Each position will 
  increase the offset of the first icon. So if the scrollbar is on 
  top the first 6 icons are shown. If the scrollbar is at the bottom, 
  only the last icon will be shown. The point of this is that as 
  long as the window is big enough to hold the largest icon, all 
  icons can be reached with the scrollbar. At first I made it scroll 
  only the number of icons not visible, so that when the scrollbar 
  was at the bottom the last x icons was shown, where x is the number 
  of visible icons in the window. This was no good. If there was a 
  very large icon, that needed to be in the first position in the 
  window to fit in the window, you could never reach it if it came 
  last. Making the number of scroll positions be the number of icons 
  - 1 solves this problem. NOTE that if you have the SPACEICONSEQUAL 
  tooltype set, the number of columns in the window might differ as 
  you scroll. The number of columns is dependent on the sizes of the 
  icons currently displayed in the window. 
  
  You might notice that the buttons, and string gadget have smaller 
  edges than gadgets you see in other programs. This is because all 
  the control panel gadgets are BOOPSI gadgets. I'm not using gad- 
  tools because gadtools would have been to complicated here, and I 
  dont really like gadtools. I think that Commodore should have 
  implemented all the gadtools gadgets as BOOPSI gadgets instead.

  If you make the window so small that no icon will fit in there 
  no icon will be displayed. I didn't want to waste any memory on 
  a gimezerozero window with 2 rastports. This will cause gadgets 
  to overwrite the window border instead of being clipped. Therefor 
  the icons have to fit completely in the window for them to be 
  shown at all. 

  If you have icons of different sizes in the window, you might get 
  less icons in the window than will fit in there, even tough you 
  know that there are more icons. RCSGUI will think that it have 
  filled up the window when an icon wont fit vertically in the window. 
  For example, if you have a window wide enough to fit 5 icons in one 
  row, but the third icon is higher than the other icons, and dont 
  completely fit vertically, it wont be displayed, and no more icons 
  after it either. I haven't figured out how to check if the window 
  really is full in a smarter way yet. For now, just make the window 
  a little bit higher, so that all the icons in a row will fit in the 
  window. The scrollbar will also help here, but you cannot get any 
  icon that doesn't fit vertically in the window.

  I have tried to install cliprects in the window to make things clip 
  to the inner bounds of the window to solve this, but gadgets seems 
  to ignore all other clipping than the rastport edges. Anybody that
  knows how to make gadgets clip to the inner bounds of a window 
  without using a gimezerozero window please inform me.

  I have gotten a mail from the person that reported the enforcer
  hit on rezise in version 1.41 that it no logner existed in 2.41.
  I have the cheap 68E030, whitout a real MMU in my machine (A4000/030). 
  Therefore I can't use enforcer myself.

  The future of this tool depends on my needs and the time I have 
  to spend on it. It never hurts to send me bug reports and sugg-
  estions though.
