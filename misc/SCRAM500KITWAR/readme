Here is the first of a series of Public Domain KitWare hardware projects
for the Amiga. On this disk you will find the design for an 8Meg RAM and
SCSI controller for the Amiga 500 (SCsi RAM for the 500 = SCRAM 500).
You will also find an order form to obtain PCB, chips and whatever you
need to build one. The SCRAM 500 is easy to build, cheap and should be
useful to a lot of people. There is a lot of information on this disk,
so have fun!

I will be publishing more PD KitWare very soon. Next will be the SCRAM
2000 - similar to the SCRAM 500 but with an optional high performance 16
bit SCSI controller (53C94). After that will be the SCRAM Jet - a low
cost '030 accelerator companion card for the SCRAM 500.
