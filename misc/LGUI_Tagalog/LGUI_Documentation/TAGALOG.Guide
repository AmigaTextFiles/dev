               TAGALOG - (National Language Of The Philippines).
              ---------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

 The TAGALOG on the LGUI TAGALOG disk is written in a Day-to-Day format, as
 opposed to a Standardized Book format. By this I mean the following:

  As I cannot think of 1000+ Sentences off the top of my head, of course I
  had to look at Books for Ideas. After reading various Books, etc I chose
  the Sentences and Words I would like to Use - Not Copy.

  From there I filtered out Long Sentences, Words that I thought might be
  too long to remember (when used with a long sentence for example), etc.
  I then created the TAGALOG Files, using my chosen Filtered Out Sentences
  and Words.

  Before I could start learning TAGALOG I had to check that the TAGALOG
  Files were Correct. So I asked a few of my Filipino Friends to help me
  with them. They told me things like: Words used at the Present, Old
  Words, Deep Words, How to say things in a Day-to-Day manner (as opposed
  to saying things in a Standardized Book manner), etc thus improving the
  Sentences and Words.

  Obviously, some things in the Books, etc I read are going to be exactly
  the same as in the TAGALOG Files simply because if that is the way things
  are said (regardless of Books, Writing, etc) then that is the way things
  are said. As I learn more TAGALOG myself the better I will be If/When I
  update the TAGALOG Files. At this present time (Saturday 23rd January 99)
  I can now Speak, and more importantly Remember!, several Hundred of the
  Sentences and Words in the TAGALOG Files.

  When I say Standardized Book format/manner I mean a Sentence will usually
  be in a Long/Formal format....

  "Could I possibly have one of your Delicious Cakes?"

  ....as opposed to a Short/Informal (Day-to-Day) format....

  "Gissa Cake!"

  ....Okay, slight exaggeration. But you get my point?

 TAGALOG is based on the English Alphabet, so it should not be too difficult
 for you to Spell and Say TAGALOG words. As the Philippines used to be under
 the Spanish there is also Spanish in the TAGALOG Language. However, most
 spanish words become Tagalog-ized when you add a Tagalog Prefix to a
 spanish word for example.

 Warning@{fg text}

 I Do NOT Say, Suggest, etc that the LGUI TAGALOG Files are Correct, etc
 in any Way, Shape or Form. If you decide to use the LGUI TAGALOG Files
 you do so knowing the above.
@endnode

@node Notes "File Notes"

 Throughout the TAGALOG Files I have tried to make the Sentences as easy as
 possible to learn, but at the same time make them Easy-Medium, Short-Long,
 etc thus hopefully getting the learning balance right. The sentences have
 also been Mixed-Up. For example. If you had a question sentence like
 "What is your Job?" and an answer sentence like "I am a Teacher". This may
 seem fine - You would simply remember the `I am a Teacher' sentence when
 someone asked you "What is your Job?" because it was in sequence (Question
 followed by Answer). However, this sequence remembering pattern would be no
 good if you wanted to use another reply like "I do not have a Job". Simply
 because your brain would more than likely bring up the `I am a Teacher'
 sentence before remembering it has other replies it could use, like
 `I do not have a Job'.

 The Sentences I have put into the TAGALOG Files, together with the
 Categories, have been designed for purposes such as:

 * People who wish to learn TAGALOG over a One Year period for example.

 * People who wish to learn TAGALOG as a Language, as opposed to just a
   Tourist Language, etc.
 
 * People who need to learn the Basics of TAGALOG - Perhaps because they
   have a Filipino Partner, A Job in the Philippines, etc.
@{fg fill}
 I have tried to put the `Most Common' Question, Answer, etc Sentences into
 the TAGALOG Files. However, you must realize that the current sentences
 are mainly Question, Answer, Comment and Command type sentences. By this I
 mean - It is very possible to make a Conversation from the sentences, but
 my main aim was to allow you to be able to Ask Questions, Say Comments,
 Issue Commands, etc (on an Easy Level?) whilst on Holiday, when talking to
 Filipinos, etc.

 I have made the Tagalog files so that you work your way Left-Downwards on
 the LGUI Options Menu before going Right-Downwards. This is so you can see
 the easy? Sentences first before progressing onto not so easy Sentences.
 I would say that if you can learn the `Answering the Telephone' category
 and the `Talking To/Meeting People' category then you should be Ok.
@{fg text}
 Throughout the TAGALOG Files I have inserted the following symbols:

      [Word/s]  -  Square Brackets mean the Word/s can be changed, for one
                   of the same type for example.

                   If a Word is a NOUN for example then you could change it
                   for a different NOUN. This might also change that
                   Sentence's meaning or just the Word itself.

      {Word/s}  -  Braces mean the Word/s in the Braces, when added to a
                   Sentence, may extend that sentence and/or change that
                   sentence's meaning.


      {....}    -  This means you you could continue the Sentence.
                   For example:

                   What Do You Think {....}

                   What Do You Think {About TOM}, {Of This Dress}, etc.


      (Word/s)  -  Brackets mean My own comment/s about a Word and/or
                   Sentence.


 Item1 / Item2  -  This means Words and/or Sentences are seperated, perhaps
                   because Item2 is showing you that it can be said
                   differently to Item1 but still have the same meaning as
                   Item1.


   Item1/Item2  -  This means a Word and/or Sentence may have two different
                   meanings when Translated to Item1 and Item2. Or may have
                   the same meaning when Translated to Item1 and Item2 but
                   have different ways/words to show the meaning.


       Word-ng  -  This occurs when a sentence is broken up into {Word}
                   sections and means: Either add a NG to that word or do
                   not add a NG to that word. For example, with...

                   Ito Ay {Isang} {Malaki-ng} {Lunsod}

                   ...You could make any of the following...

                   Ito Ay Malaki = This is BIG (No NG).

                   Ito Ay Isang Lunsod = This is A CITY.

                   Ito Ay Isang Malaking Lunsod = This is A BIG CITY
                   (NG was added to Malaki).


        Word-g  -  Same as above, but applies to G.


        Blox/y  -  Blox or Bloxy are used as a Surname.


      H.S-Shop  -  H.S Shop is used to denote an High Street Shop. The
                   reason for Blox/y and H.S Shop is just to protect myself.
                   I did not want to use a proper name of a person or shop
                   just in case I got complaints.

 These symbols are in most, if not all, Categories to Help you. However, I
 have left some Words/Sentences without symbols so that you can test your-
 self. There are also a variety of ways to say certain sentences/things
 which could also be helpful for testing purposes.

 PLEASE NOTE: THE SYMBOLS ABOVE ARE FOR READABILITY PURPOSES ONLY. THEY ARE
              NOTHING TO DO WITH LGUI WHATSOEVER.

 The last Miscellaneous/Various Category is not really Mixed, as in the true
 sense of the word Miscellaneous. By this I mean, the last category has got
 a mixture of the other categories in it aswell. For example, instead of
 putting every `Home' sentence into the Home Category I just put the every
 day `Home' sentences into that category and then put the Not-Used-Every-Day
 'Home' sentences into the last Miscellaneous Category. Thus, at a later
 learning stage you could learn the Miscellaneous `Home' sentences.

 In this document I have put V.C Rule to denote the following...

 In many applications, such as Numbers, you will come across the V.C Rule
 (Vowel/Consonant Rule). This is a rule that means, for example, if a word
 ends in a Vowel it is usually NG-ed. However, if it ends in a Consonant
 it is usually NA-ed.

 Finally, You will notice that I use the same words over and over again in
 the Sentences. This is because I believe that by doing this you have a
 better chance of remembering the sentence structures. For example:

    Siya Ay [Maganda] - She Is Beautiful

 Siya Ba Ay [Maganda] - Is She Beatiful

 All you had to remember was the BA part of the sentence, when the sentence
 changed. If I had repeated the SIYA AY [MAGANDA] sentence 10 times, for
 example, changing the MAGANDA word each time this would of meant you having
 to remember 10 different words for the same sentence structure.

 This section describes the Basics of Tagalog (Plural, Prefixes, Infixes,
 Past/Present/Future Tenses, etc). This section has been inserted for those
 who want to learn Tagalog as a Language (as opposed to a Tourist Language)
 rather than just remember sentences from the top of their heads for example@{fg shine}

 TENSES@{fg text}

 UM and MAG Verbs are used to emphasize the Doer of the Action or the act
 itself.

 UM is Prefixed to the Root word when the root word begins with a Vowel.
 UM is Infixed (after the first letter) when the root word begins with a
 Consonant.
@{fg shine}
 UM Vowel@{fg text}

    Past Tense:  Prefix + Root (Of the same form as the Infinitive word).

                 E.g: Alis.  Prefix = UM.

                             Add the Root word (Alis).

                 So the past tense of Alis (Leave) is: Umalis (Left).


 Present Tense:  Prefix + Reduplicate 1st Syllable of the Root word + Root
                 word.

                 E.g: Alis.  Prefix = UM.

                             Reduplicate 1st Syllable of the Root word
                             (Alis) = A.

                             Add the Root word (Alis).

                 So the present tense of Alis (Leave) is: Umaalis (Leaving).


  Future Tense:  Remove UM and reduplicate 1st Syllable of the Root word.

                 E.g: Alis.  Remove Prefix UM, if need be.

                             Reduplicate 1st Syllable of the Root word
                             (Alis) = A.

                             Add the Root word (Alis).

                 So the future tense of Alis (Leave) is: Aalis (To Leave).
@{fg shine}
 UM Consonant@{fg text}

    Past Tense:  Infix UM into the 1st Syllable of the Root word (Of the
                 same form as the Infinitive word).

                 E.g: Takbo.  Infix UM.

                 So the past tense of Takbo (Run) is: Tumakbo (Ran).


 Present Tense:  Reduplicate the 1st Syllable of the Root word + Root word +
                 Infix UM into the 1st Syllable of the new word.

                 E.g: Takbo.  Reduplicate the 1st Syllable of the Root word
                              (Takbo) = TA.

                              Add the Root word (Takbo). You now have a new
                              word TATAKBO.

                              Infix UM into the 1st Syllable of the new word
                              (Tatakbo).

                      So the present tense of the Root word Takbo (Run) is:
                      Tumatakbo (Running).


  Future Tense:  Remove UM + Reduplicate 1st Syllable of the Root word.

                 E.g: Takbo.  Remove UM, if need be.

                              Reduplicate 1st Syllable of the root word
                              (takbo) = TA.

                    So the future tense of Takbo (Run) is: Tatakbo (To Run).


 Note: With Present Tense, If the 2nd Syllable of the Infinitive word has a
       final Consonant it should not be included.
@{fg shine}
 MAG, MA and MANG@{fg text}

    Past Tense:  Change M of the Infinitive word to N.

                 E.g:  Magbayad (To Pay) = Nagbayad (Paid)

                        Mabuhay = Nabuhay

                      Manghingi = Nanghingi


 Present Tense:  Change M of the Infinitive word to N and then reduplicate
                 the 1st Syllable of the Root word.

                 E.g:  Magbayad (To Pay) = Nagbabayad (Paying)

                        Mabuhay = Nabubuhay

                      Manghingi = Nanghihingi


  Future Tense:  Reduplicate the 1st Syllable of the Root word.

                 E.g:  Magbayad (To Pay) = Magbabayad (Going To Pay)

                        Mabuhay = Mabubuhay

                      Manghingi = Manghihingi
@{fg shine}
 IN@{fg text}

 The IN Verb emphasizes on the Receiver of the Action. The Receiver then
 becomes the Subject of the Passive sentence. All IN verbs are Passive.

 Note: The Doer of the IN verb is always in the possessive form. E.g:

       Action          Doer            Receiver
       ------          ----            --------

       Binili          Ng Bata         Ang Aklat

       Was Bought      By The Child    The Book


       Binasa          Ko              Ang Sulat

       Was Read        By Me           The Letter


 IN is used, in Past and Present Tenses, as UM above.

    Past Tense E.g:  Ibigay (To Give) = Ibinigay (Gave)

 Present Tense E.g:  Ibigay (To Give) = Ibinibigay (Giving)


 Note: All IN and NI Verbs which end in the suffixes IN, HIN or NIN lose
       their suffixes in the Present and Past Tenses. The suffixes are
       restored in the Future Tenses.
@{fg shine}
 IN Vowel@{fg text}

    Past Tense:  Prefix + Root Word (E.g: In + Alis = Inalis)

 Present Tense:  Prefix + Reduplicate the 1st Syllable of Root Word +
                 Root Word (E.g: In + A + Alis = Inaalis)

  Future Tense:  Reduplicate the 1st Syllable of the Root Word + Root Word +
                 Suffix (E.g: A + Alis + In = Aalisin)
@{fg shine}
 IN Consonant@{fg text}

    Past Tense:  Root Word + Infix (After the 1st Consonant)
                 (E.g: Basa + In = Binasa)

 Present Tense:  Reduplicate the 1st Syllable of Root Word + Root Word +
                 Infix (After the 1st Consonant)
                 (E.g: Ba + Basa + In = Binabasa)

  Future Tense:  Reduplicate the 1st Syllable of the Root Word + Root Word +
                 Suffix (E.g: Ba + Basa + In = Babasain)

 MAY@{fg text}

  May is followed by a Noun, Adjective, Numerals, the plural MGA and Action
  Words (Verbs).
@{fg shine}
 MAYROON@{fg text}

  Mayroon is followed by particles or monosyllables, the personal Pronoun in
  the nomative in transposed sentences and in answering Questions.
@{fg fill}
  Wala is a negative form of Mayroon and May.

  Both Mayroon and May express actual possession. When the possessor is not
  mentioned in the sentence the meaning conveyed by MAY is: There Is. They
  do not express specific Time or Time Relationship.

  The MA prefix in the words Marami, Mataas, Maganda, etc mean May Dami, May
  Taas, May Ganda, etc. In short, with Abstract Nouns, MA means: There Is.
  With Concrete Nouns MA means: Many.

  E.g: May is replaced by Wala with Ligature NG:

             May Pagkain Kami - We have food

          Walang Pagkain Kami - We have no food

  E.g: Mayroon is replaced by Wala only:

          Mayroon Ka Bang Pagkain - Do you have any food?

             Wala Ka Bang Pagkain - Don't you have any food?

               Was Eaten         By The Dog      The Bread


  Ng occurs as a Suffix to a word ending with a Vowel. When a word ends with
  an N, the N is replaced by NG.
@{fg shine}
 NGA@{fg text}

  Nga denotes PLEASE. I have not put this in the Tagalog Files that much as
  it is hard to pronounce. There are other ways to say Please, but Nga gives
  a sentence higher Respect, Sincerity, etc - especially when added to a
  sentence with Please already in it.
@{fg shine}
 AY@{fg text}

  Ay denotes Is, Are, Was, etc (Equivalent to linking Verb to be).
@{fg shine}
 ANG@{fg text}

        Good....And You? How Are You?
 
     A) Mabuti Naman.

        Good Also.

  In the above, Q) Naman was showing respect. In the first A) you could of
  said Kumusta Ka only, but the respect/politeness would not be there. In
  the final A) Naman was used to mean Also aswell as giving respect (you
  could of just answered with Mabuti). Of course body language, a smile, etc
  also denote politeness and respect but if you are on the phone where no
  one can see your face Naman simply confirms politeness/respect. Manners
  cost nothing.
@{fg shine}
 HOY@{fg text}

  Hoy is used to call someones attention, like in England: Pssst or Hey.
  Although Hoy may sound rude/aggressive in England, this is not the case
  in the Philippines (it is considered Friendly).
@{fg shine}
 MABAIT/MAHUSAY/MAGALING@{fg text}

  Mabait is only used for Characterization. I.e. Good Persion, Good Woman,
  Virtuous Person, etc.

  These 3 words (meaning: Good or Well) are used as:

       Siyang Magturo).

    2) The condition of an Object (I.e. The Machine Runs (Works) Well -
       Mabuti Ang Takbo Ng Makina).

  Magaling is usually used for Health. I.e. Is She Well Now? - Magaling Na
  Ba Siya. Magaling and Mahusay are used for Intelligence and Personal
  Ability. Mahusay example:

@{fg shine}
 IBIG/NAIS@{fg text}

  become Married). Mahalin or Magmahal are used for the love that exists
  between Family, etc. Sometimes Ibig and Nais words are expressed like so:
  I Love Ice Cream. I Wish I could have / I Desire Ice Cream. Although in
  most cases it is best to use GUSTO when expressing LIKE, WOULD LIKE, etc.
@{fg shine}
 NOONG@{fg text}

                  Noong Linggo = Last Sunday.

            Noong Isang Linggo = Last Week/A Week Ago.

             Noong Isang Buwan = Last Month/A Month Ago.
@{fg fill}
 Basically, I would say BA, KA, MO, PA, NA and MGA (Once mastered) should be
 your best friends in the Sentences. ANG and NG and the N and S words (Siya,
 Niya, Sila, Nila) might give you an Headache! to start off with (simply
 because it is hard to remember which ones should be used), but patience
 should pay off.
  
 For example, by reading the Past, Present and Future Tense parts of this
 document (when you need to) you should find reading Sentences easier. With
 ANG and NG, again read the relevant parts of this document when needed, you
 should find a pattern/rules emerging the more you study and learn. Words
 that start off with NG (I.e Ngiti - Smile) are like NGA (They are hard to
 pronounce) because you pronounce them through the Nose, thus, they may give
 you an Hang-Over!! Mind you, most NG words either have an alternative word
 to use or are words that are not said regularly - So you should not have
 too many problems!?

@{fg shine}
 NAKA@{fg text}

 NAKA when fixed to a Root word expresses the State, Condition or Appearance
 of a Person or Thing. It has no Tense forms, being Descriptive and Active
 in sense. Words with NAKA are closely similar to the English PARTICIPLE - A
 Verb used as an Adjective to describe a Noun.

 Examples:  E.g_1   Ang Bata Ay Nakaupo {Sa Mataas Na Silya}

                    The Child Is Seated/Sitting {On A High-Chair}

            E.g_2   Ang Lalaking Nakahiga Ay [???]

                    The Man Lying Down Is [???]
@{fg shine}
 MAKA@{fg text}

 MAKA Verbs have the same meanings as the MA Verbs, only they are all Active
 and so take the nomative doers. Not all MA Verbs have their equivalents in
 MAKA. Maka Verbs can only be made from words showing Action, NOT Emotion or
 Feeling. These generally do not have imperative forms.

 Examples:   MakaUpo   = To Be Able To Sit.
             MakaKita  =               See.
             MakaKain  =               Eat.

             MakaRinig =               Hear.
             MakaBili  =               Buy.
             MakaBasa  =               Read.

 MAGING@{fg text}

 MAGING is used with a Noun or Adjective. The two words, Maging and Noun
 for example, then mean `To Become' or `To Be' what the last one says'.
 In other words, it expresses a change from one condition or state to
 another. `To Become' and `To Be' are synonymous in Tagalog - They both
 can be expressed by Maging.

 Examples:  Maging Mabait  = To Become/To Be Good
            Maging Masama  = To Become Bad
            Maging Guro    = To Become a Teacher
            Maging Bulag   = To Become Blind

             Future Tense = Magiging Mabait


                  Gusto Kong Maging Guro - I Would Like To Become A Teacher

              Ayaw Mo Bang Maging Doktor - Don't You Like To Be A Doctor

 Interrogative Plurals@{fg text}

 When a word is composed of two syllables we repeat the whole word:

 When a word has three or more syllables we repeat the first two syllables
 only:

    Kanino = Kani-Kanino

   Magkano = Magka-Magkano

 Any sound of `O' in the last syllable becomes `U':

    Ano = Anu-Ano

@node Pronunciation "Pronunciation"

 In the TAGALOG Speech File/s I have tried my best to get the Pronunciation,
 etc as near as possible to the actual sound of each word. However, in some
 cases, I could not control the speech sound due to the Amiga of course.
 Thus, here are some basic guidelines to the speech file/s....

 * Because the Amiga makes its `A' sound sound like a small `a' (as you
   would pronounce a small `a' in school), I have had to make the `A' sound
   I need (As In: Ah for Apple) by using an h sound. For example. To get MA
   to have an Apple sound I used MAH instead. The trouble with this is that
   my MAH sound sounds over-stressed. So when you hear my MAH, TAH, etc
   words pronounce them with less stress on the h - Let your tongue/voice
   pronounce only half of the h. So not quite pronouncing/stressing the h.
   The opposite applies to the KITA words - The KI syllable should sound
   like Kee/Key (E.gs: Magkita = Mag Key Tah, Nakita = Nah Key Tah, etc).

 * Words beginning with `I' are, most of the time, pronounced as: E.

 * Words beginning with `E' are, most of the time, pronounced as Eh (As in:
   the way you would prononce a small `e' in school).

 * Words like Ka, Ba, Na, etc are pronounced with an Ah (Apple) sound on the
   `a' syllable, as mentioned above with MAH, etc.

 * The speed of speech varies, due to the Amiga. In these cases I have
   chopped a word up so that either each or all syllables of that word can
   be heard and/or pronounced better. And/or so that that word can be slowed
   down.

 * Some words that have TAY, GAY, etc in them are sometimes pronounced as
   Tie, Guy, etc.

 * Some words that have TAW, LAW, etc in them are sometimes pronounced as
   Tou (As In: Tower), Lou (As In: Allow), etc. They have an `How' sound
   is what I mean.

 * Most words that have a U in them are pronounced as: Who.

 * AY is pronounced as: I/Eye.

 * Kailan should be pronounced as Ka-E-Lan, but most people I know say
   Kay-Lan instead.

 * Some people use LANG instead of LAMANG.

 * Some people pronounce SIYA (Se Yah) as SHAH.

 * Some Syllables sound as though they over-lap when they do not. An example
   of this is the english word: Sister. Some people may say SIS TER but
   others may say (over-lap, etc) SIS STER, SIS STA or SIST A depending on
   where they come from. The same goes in Tagalog. Some may say OR AS and
   some may say (over-lap, etc) OR RAS for the word TIME. In tagalog this
   mainly occurs in words like MA-RA-MI (over-lap sounds like MA RAM MI.
   Double M sound).

 * TS is pronounced as CH.

   Example: Petsa (Date) is pronounced PEH CHA and not PET SAH.

 Overall, I would suggest you use the Speech File/s to get to know how a
 word is spoken (via each Syllable) as opposed to using the Speech File/s
 as the perfect way to say/pronounce a word. My Filipino Friends tell me
 that the Words/Syllables are quite accurate, it is just the TONE that is
 missing. I would also suggest (to some degree) that you try to imitate a
 Filipino's Voice.
