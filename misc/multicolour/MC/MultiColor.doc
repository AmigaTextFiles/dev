1.0 What is MultiColor ?
------------------------

MultiColor (MC) is a new technique to simulate displays with many colours.


1.1 How many colours ?
----------------------

Following table shows the number of possible colors.

\           |         |           |
 --\    typ | OCS     | AGA       |
    ---\    | ECS     | GFX-Cards |
res     --\ | 0       | 1         |
------------+---------+-----------+
ehb 236x276 | 4096/16 | -         |
low 236x276 | 1331/11 | 614125/85 |
hi  472x276 |  216/ 6 | 614125/85 |
shi 944x276 |    -    | 614125/85 |
------------+---------+-----------+

res :
This shows the maximum resolution.

typ :
What machine is used.

colours :
How many colours can be displayed.
1st number : maximum different colours
2nd number : number of shades of every colour part (r/g/b)


1.2 I want to see that !
------------------------

There are some small progis to demonstrate the system.
All prgramms have two parameters :
 typ   0=OCS/ECS 1=AGA/GFX-Cards
 res   e=ehb l=low h=hi s=shi

* MC_Bleed

mc_bleed typ res [edge1] [edge2] [edge3] [edge4]

This program generates colourshades with four edges. To alternate the colours
you can enter the colour for every edge as number (12 bit-number).

* MC_PicView

mc_bleed typ res name [red-offset] [green-offset] [blue-offset]

PicView displays you 24-bit pictures. Therefore you have to scale the picture
to the rigth resolution and to convert the picture to raw-format (AdPro :
sculpt-saver). Name the 3 Files as <name>.r, <name>.g and <name>.b.
The last thre parameters are for colourcontrol and the value should be between
-1.0 and 1.0. A positive number makes the part brighter and a negative one
darker.

* MC_Plasma

mc_plasma typ res [chaos]

This one generates the well known plasmas but more colourful. The chaosvalue
controls the smoothness. Smaller values -> smoother pictures. Bigger values ->
more chaotic pictures. This value should be between 0.0 and 1000.0 (default
20.0)

* MC_Spots

mc_spots typ res [spotlist]

This progie draws gradient filled balls on the screen. The positions and
colours are from a file (some examples are included).


1.3 For what purpose is this ?
------------------------------

MC could be used for true-colour previews, because you have no palette restric-
tions - every part of the colour lays between 0.0 and 1.0. MC does the trans-
lations for you.
Another idea is to use it for a game (it`s not slower). The advantage is that
this game will works on all amigas, because the gfx will automatically conver-
ted.


1.4 Please contact me !
-----------------------

Please contact me and let me know, what you think about it. I will not spend
very much time with developing this, because the is enough to do on my other
projects (SoundFX/FractalUniverse).
