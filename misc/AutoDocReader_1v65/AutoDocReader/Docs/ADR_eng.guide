///Wstep
@NODE Wstep "1.1 Introduction"

	@{b}@{u}For whom?@{uu}@{ub}

    Developers documentation in autodoc format is often needed in everyday
work.
    Getting familiar with a lot of files and searching tons of text for desired
information is not an easy task. That's where the idea of writing a programme
that could ease using autodocs came.
First versions of the programme have been written by Pawel 'Stefkos'
Stefanski. Currently the one who is responsible for it is Marian 'MaaG^dA' Guc.

	What does AutoDocReader give you?

 - possibility of creating a database of ours autodocs files,
 - fast and easy documents browsing,
 - possibility of independent loading of autodocs not included in a base,
 - search engine for functions, methods and parameters,
 - easy usage with mouse or keyboard.

The programme can act as separate viewer or autodoc-viewing module for other
software (e.g. DOpus or GED).

The programme is under constant development, so if you notice bugs or have
idea regarding the programme's function - contact @{"us" LINK Autorzy}.

@ENDNODE
///
///Wymagania
@NODE Wymagania "1.2 Requirements"

	@{b}@{u}Requirements and status@{uu}@{ub}

The programme needs MorphOS/AmigaOS system and a following, properly installed
components:

1. Magic User Interface (MUI) in version at least 3.8,
2. MUI classes:
	NList.mcc,
	NListview.mcc,
	NListtree.mcc,
	Balance.mcc (or better BetterBalance.mcc).

The programme is writen and tested on Pegasos II G4/1000 computer. Please
contact the respective authors in case of problems with version for other
machines.

@{i}
The most recent AutoDocReader version is available at:
<http://www.mguc.ppa.pl>
@{ui}

	@{b}This software is freeware.@{ub}
@{b}Notes:@{ub}
	@{u}You need the author consent to place the programme archive (in any
	form) on commercial publication .@{uu}
	@{fg shine}Distribution of single elements of the archive is
	inadmissible!@{fg text}

@ENDNODE
///

///Instalacja
@NODE Instalacja "2.1 Installation"

	@{b}@{u}Installation@{uu}@{ub}

	To run the programme first you must unpack the archive to any
directory on your disk. Now the programme can be run (if @{"required components" LINK Wymagania}
are installed.

@{i}Notes:@{ui}

I.	If you'd been using previous versions of the programme you should
	delete ADR.x.prefs and ADR.x.cfg (where x are successive numbers
        starting from 1) from env:mui/ and envarch:mui/ directories.

II.	The programme is developed in Polish and that's its default language.
	There are a few additional languages available. If your language is
	not supported and you don't want (or can't) use Polish, you should
	properly configure locale settings in your system. Add English or
	German (or other) to "Preferred languages" to receive setting like
	this:

        xxxxx (your language)
	English/Deutsch (or any other available with the programme).

	Now the programme will run in a chosen language.

@ENDNODE
///
///Shell
@NODE Shell "2.2 Shell"

	@{b}@{u}Command line parameters@{uu}@{ub}

In case of starting the programme from command line (Shell/CLI) use:

AutoDocReader FILE_NAME/A
where:
	FILE_NAME is full name of a file with it's path.

The programme will load given file at start if only it exist in this location.
This way of running the programme is intended for using AutoDocReader as
an external viewer for other programmes. That's why the GUI is simplified when
compared with the one for Workbench/Ambient starting.

For example, in case of DOpus 4.1x: define autodoc filetype and add
"AutoDocReader {f}" action for double-click. Now you can view documents is
easy way.

FILE_NAME argument can also be the name of an ADR base file (#?.adr). The
programme will load and open that base then.

@ENDNODE
///
///Tooltypes
@NODE Tooltypes "2.3 Tooltypes"

	@{b}@{u}Workbench/Ambient parameters (tooltypes)@{uu}@{ub}

Running the programme from Workbencha/Ambienta gives you, beside "full" GUI,
a chance of changing the way AutoDocReader works. It is possible by means of
parameters in the programme's icon (tooltypes).

Available parameters have been divided into function groups.

@{u}1. Group View - GUI settings@{uu}

@{b}View.TinyGUI@{ub}
Tooltype defining what kind of GUI should the programme use.
By default, starting AutoDocReader from Workbench/Ambient results in "full"
GUI - it means access to autodoc database is available. Simply active this
tooltype if you want to run the programme in viewer mode (like in case
of running it from command line).

@{b}View.NoSelFunc@{ub}
This tooltype switches on/off auto-marking of first available function of
opened files.
By default, opened file is analyzed, its index is shown and a content of
a first position on the index is displayed.

@{b}View.ASL_Pattern@{ub}
Tooltype which can be used to define wildcards for ASL file requester used
while loading files.

@{b}View.TabSize@{ub}
This tooltype defines the way the "TAB" (0x09) code is displayed.
When AutoDocReader finds "TAB" code in text, it'll convert it into defined
number of spaces.
Accepted range of value: 1 - 16 spaces (default: 7)

@{b}View.FunSize@{ub}
With this tooltype you can define how many spaces will precede displayed name
of a section (e.g NAME, OPTIONS).
Accepted range of value: 1 -32 spaces (default: 0)

@{b}View.TxtSize@{ub}
This tooltype define number of spaces preceding each displayed line of text.
Accepted range of value: 1 -32 spaces (default: 3)

@{u}2. Group Base - base operations settings@{uu}

@{b}Base.AutoOpen@{ub}
This tooltype define if AutoDocReader should open recently used base (with
functions and sections selection) at start.

@{b}Base.Default@{ub}
Tooltype defining name and location of default base of autodoc files. You
can give here a name of a base to open at start if Base.AutoOpen tooltype is
active.

	This options opens file reqester allowing us to select directory and
	name for saving current document. Action depends on active tab -
	with "Base" tab active document from file base will be saved, with

	Documents are saved in format not depending on group @{"View" LINK Tooltypes}
	settings.

	Use a string gadget to enter a name of added or modified group.

@{b}File(s)@{ub}
	"Add" opens an ASL requester to select files to be added to the base.
	Files will be added in a marked place in a base. In case of no place
	is selected, files will be added in main group of a base.

@{b}Selected@{ub}
	"Deselect" removes a selection from structure window. It is needed
	when there is a new object to be placed on the highest level of the
	structure.
	"Delete" - deletes selected objects (or groups of objects) from the

If there is need to move an object-tree to a different place, simply use
"drag'n'drop" technique to do it and place it in desired part of a structure.

Contents of the window (or its part) can be copied to system clipboard
as well.
@{i}
Not all of authors of autodoc files follow the rules of creating them, hence
it is possible that a file is displayed incorrectly. Corrections in sorce file
are needed to get proper presentation in such case. The programme has been
tested with a large number of documents and a lot of possible unobservances of
rules are implemented. However, it cannot be guaranteed that all unproperly
prepared files will be properly read and displayed.
