Short: An exec.library clone (C source included)

What is it?

Amigem is an exec clone originally designed to provide a amiga-like 
development environment for Posix compliant operating systems.
It's not only an emulation library but provides support for dispatching,
memory management, etc.

The original goal is not yet reached but there are some activities
going on in comp.sys.amiga.misc to rewrite the OS and there's no
need to invent the wheel twice (or me spending a lot of time for nothing).
Therefore I decided to release this pre-release :-/.

Copyright:

Oh, well - GPL. Talk to me if you think something else would be better.

Running:

Unpack the archive, cd into amigem/amilo then type amilo. After the
rom image is loaded you can see the dispatcher working.

Amigem is written mostly in C - if the C code might look a bit strange
to you don't worry - that's my way to provide registerized parameters
with gcc.
