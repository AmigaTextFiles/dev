@{B}
Introduction@{UB}
   Visions is a new programming language for the Amiga, which has
   been designed to allow you to create mini-multimedia presentations
   and graphical adventure games such as ClickBOOM's fantastic Myst.

   With visions you can include IFF images and animations, as well as
   standard tracker modules. The built-in variable system allows you
   to place collectable items etc. Buttons and `Area Zones' can also
   be added, which allows the user to goto different places when they
   click on the screen.

@NODE commands "Command List"
@{B}
Command List@{UB}
   This command list gives brief details of the commands available in
   Visions, and are in no specific order. Alternatively, you can go to
   the @{"command index" LINK "cindx"}, which lists all the commands in
   alphabetic order.
@{B}
BEGIN(PageName)@{UB}
   Sets up the start of a new page name or `node'. The first page of
   your scripts must be called ` MAIN '.
@{B}
STOP@{UB}
   Calls an end to the page.
@{B}
SCREEN(Width,Height,Depth,$ViewMode)@{UB}
   Opens an intuition screen. The width represents the pixels, and 
   likewise for the height. The depth is the amount of colours which 
   can be used on screen, these are:
   @{I}Depth Information@{UI}
   1   =     2 colours
   2   =     4 colours
   3   =     8 colours
   4   =    16 colours
   5   =    32 colours
   6   =    64 colours
   7   =   128 colours
   8   =   256 colours

   The view mode represents the screenmode to be used. Display ID's 
   are listed below:
   @{I}
   PAL Screen Modes:@{UI}
   $0          =   Low Res
   $4          =   Low Res Laced
   $8000       =   High Res
   $8004       =   High Res Laced
   $8020       =   Super-High Res
   $8024       =   Super-High Res Laced
   @{I}
   NTSC Screen Modes:@{UI}
   $11000      =   Low Res
   $11004      =   Low Res Laced
   $19000      =   High Res
   $19004      =   High Res Laced
   $19020      =   Super-High Res
   $19024      =   Super-High Res Laced

   @{U}Warning!!!@{UU}
   Incorrect usage of the SCREEN command will cause your system to crash!
@{B}
ILBM(IlbmFile)@{UB}
   Loads the specified ilbm image. A screen must be opened before use, 
   and must be large enough to display the image.
@{B}
ANIM(AnimationFile,FrameRate)@{UB}
   Loads and plays the specified animation. The FrameRate sets the
   speed of the animation playback, zero being the fastest possible.
@{B}
ANIMWAIT@{UB}
   Causes Visions to wait until the animation has finished before giving
   control back to the user.
@{B}
ANIMLOOP@{UB}
   Sets animations to loop. This command must be issued before the ANIM
   command is used.


@{B}
ADDZONE(x1,y1,x2,y2,$flags,PageName)@{UB}
   Add zone will set up a screen zone and will go to the specified page
   name if the user clicked within the X and Y zones.
   @{I}
   Flags@{UI}
   $0  =   LMB
   $1  =   RMB
   $2  =   LBM & RMB together
   $4  =   Any mouse button or combination
@{B}


IF(Variable=Value)@{UB}
   Sets up an IF structure, which can be ended using the command
   ` ENDIF '.
@{B}
ENDIF@{UB}
   Calls an end to any IF structure.
@{B}
GOTO(PageName)@{UB}
   Causes Visions to jump to the specified page name.
@{B}
GLOW(x1,y1,x2,y2,ColourRegister,R,G,B)@{UB}
   Glow allows you to setup a colour that will change if your mouse cursor
   is within the specified area. R,G and B can range from 0 to 255. This
   command is ideal for buttons.
@{B}


EXECUTE(CommandLine)@{UB}
   Execute will execute any command you specify within the CommandLine.
@{B}
SYSTEM@{UB}
   Forces Visions to quit.


@{B}
DEC(Variable[=Value][,])@{UB}
   Declares a variable for later use in the script. All variable *MUST*
   be declared be for use.

   Sets the variable to the specified value. i.e. LET(Score,0)

   Adds the specified value to the specified variable.
@{B}
SUB(Variable,Value)@{UB}
   Takes the specified value from the specified variable.
@{B}
DIV(Variable,Value)@{UB}
   Divides the specified variable by the specified value.
@{B}
MUL(Variable,Value)@{UB}
   Multiplies the specified variable by the specified value.
@{B}
RND(Variable,Range/Variable)@{UB}
   Causes the specified variable to equal a random number between 0 and
   the range given. i.e. RND(RandomNumber,1000)

@NODE Tips "Hints And Tips"
@{B}
Hints And Tips@{UB}
   If you are creating a graphical adventure game, then we recommend using
   a low screen mode or few colours. The main reason for this is to stop
   the screen from `flickering' every time a new frame is loaded. This is
   due to the fact that because Visions does NOT use double buffering,
   the AGA chipset is unable to redraw the screen quick enough, and causes
   the screen to flicker.

   Also try to keep to one screen mode and the same amount of colours,
   as Visions has to alter the screen if the images differ from the
   previous. Note that Visions is currently only in the early stages of
   development, and these limitations will probably be removed later on.
