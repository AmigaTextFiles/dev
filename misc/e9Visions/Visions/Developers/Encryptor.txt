Visions Encryptor v1.0B
-----------------------
Encryptor converts normal Visions scripts into an encrypted binary file 
format called `VIS2'. There are two advantages of using Encryptor. 
The first is that your code is very secure, as it can't be viewed or
altered because it's all encrypted, making it very hard for people to 
cheat whilst using your scripts. Secondly, VIS2 files load around 
40% faster into Visions than normal EAC scripts do, due to the fact that
all of the jump tables are contained within the code, this does however,
make your code a tiny bit bigger.


------------------------
Is Encryptor a compiler?
------------------------
No. Encryptor only scrambles the data so that no one except Visions
can read it. Encryptor will not make executable files.


---------------------------------------
Does this program work for EAC scripts?
---------------------------------------
Although similar, this program will *not* encrypt EAC scripts. Use the
EAC encryptor instead.


---------
Shareware
---------
To stop the shareware requester stating that you have used an unregistered
version of Visions popping up when you load your encrypted scripts into
Visions, you must register this software. Please read the guides for more
information.


----------
Disclaimer
----------
This program should only be used by advanced Visions coders. Make sure you
keep a copy of your source code when converting your scripts!
