@NODE "About" "About"

  The reason I developed the AutodocViewer was that I was tired
of paging the Amiga ROM Kernel and until now I have failed to find any
application to browse the autodoc files in a smooth maner.

The first version of AutodocViewer was made back in 1994, but I was not
entirely satisfied with the concept and completely rewrote the program.
The program has turned out to be most usefull, and as far as I know 
no major bugs.

This version was made in 1995 (???), in early 1996 some bugs where
removed.

AutodocViewer was coded in pure assembly. The final v1.0 source code
adds up to 230.258 bytes and the assembled file are on 30.124 bytes.
Since then, even bigger.

@NODE "WhatIs" "What is AutodocViewer"


AutodocViewer is a smart piece of code made by @{"Ronny Tennebekk" LINK "Author"} which enables
you to access your autodocs fast and effeciently, and with a standard
intuitive and highly configurable interface.

AutodocViewer is surely aimed at all developers out there looking for an
easy way to lookup the information found in the CBM's autodocfiles.
@ENDNODE


@NODE "Understanding" "Understanding AutodocViewer"


The AutodocViewer basically consist of four windows.
The Groups, Autodocs, functions, and viewer window.

These windows are connected, and their contens operates like a 
directory tree. To lookup information on a special function, you 
navigate from Groups to the autodoc wich contains the function you
want to lookup. Select the right function, and the viewer window displays
information on how to use this particular function.

See @{"Screenshot" LINK Screenshot.iff/Main} of AutodocViewer

The Group windows is for your own arranging of autodocs. You may have 
any number of groups, but you must have at least one.
Under each group you add the autodoc files you find appropriate.
The function and viewer windows are updated automatically.

@NODE "Tricks" "Neat tricks"


Here is a list of those little things that make life easier
when using AutodocViewer.


- You can use the TAB key to switch through windows.

- When Group, Autodoc, or Function window are active you may press
  a character on your keyboard (A - Z) to jump to closest match in the list.

- Any windows may be scrolled up and down by the Arrow keys.

- Shift + arrows keys jump one page up or down.

- CTRL + arrows keys jump to the top or bottom of the list.

- For improved filerequester, we recomend a patch like Reqchange.
  ( for compatibility we use ASL requesters as default )

AutodocViewer v1.32 History

Ronny Tennebekk

First release
Version BETA 1.0 release, had a number of minor bugs.


Version 1.32

Changes from v1.31

 02.04.99  - A minor bug reported from Jean-François Fabre has been removed.
 12:15:19    While having only one group added to the list and rerunning
             AutodocViewer, a DosError requester would appear.
             Even though no autodocs where added, AutodocViewer did try to
             access one. Thanx Jean :-)

 31.03.99  - Many people have pointed out the underscore in requesters,
 10:32:11    I did assume that rtpatch where used heavly out there, but
             I was wrong... All underscores in rtpatched requesters
             has been removed...

Changes from v1.3

 27.03.99  - The configuration and prefs file has been moved to the PROGDIR:
 22:35:51    instead of S: requested by several people. The install script
             will ask you if you want to copy existing files

 27.03.99  - A minor "Work up" in the function window when  it's
 22:09:42    empty and resized has been eliminated. Reported by Michael Malyshev


Changes from v1.2

 23.03.99  - Some bugs fixed in Univerzal Configuration
 22:16:24    except for one :-(

 23.03.99  - A minor bug in the keyboard shortcut
 21:09:06    routine has been corrected

Changes from v1.0

             to refresh it self.
