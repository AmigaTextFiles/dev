Version 1.32

Changes from v1.31

 02.04.99  - A minor bug reported from Jean-François Fabre has been removed.
 12:15:19    While having only one group added to the list and rerunning
             AutodocViewer, a DosError requester would appear.
             Even though no autodocs where added, AutodocViewer did try to
             access one. Thanx Jean :-)

 31.03.99  - Many people have pointed out the underscore in requesters,
 10:32:11    I did assume that rtpatch where used heavly out there, but
             I was wrong... All underscores in rtpatched requesters
             has been removed...

Changes from v1.3

 27.03.99  - The configuration and prefs file has been moved to the PROGDIR:
 22:35:51    instead of S: requested by several people. The install script
             will ask you if you want to copy existing files

 27.03.99  - A minor "Work up" in the function window when  it's
 22:09:42    empty and resized has been eliminated. Reported by Michael Malyshev
