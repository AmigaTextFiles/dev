@{b}INTRODUCTION@{ub}

ProtoMaker is a small programming tool that makes use of the SAS/C GENPROTO option. 
It opens an app-icon or app-window, where you can drop proto files, and c files, and 
then prototype declarations for the c file wil be generated and put into the proto file.

I wrote this program for myself in 1993. I have found it quite useful. I think the biggest 
reason why I haven't released it until now is that I have just been too lazy to do it. Writing 
this documentation and fighting AmigaGuide takes time ;-).

@{b}INSTALLATION@{ub}
  
ProtoMaker is made up of 2 files: the executable and the icon. That's it! Just copy it to
whereever you want. Also see the comment about the def_p icon under @{"Usage" link "Usage" 18}.

@{b}CONFIGURATION@{ub}
  
The following tooltypes can be set:

  @{FG HIGHLIGHT}@{b}WINDOW@{ub}@{FG TEXT} 
     This will make ProtoMaker open its window instead of the icon when it starts. Default
     is to start iconized.
     
  @{FG HIGHLIGHT}@{b}SCGPDEFOPTS=options@{ub}@{FG TEXT}
     This is the GENPROTO options to use. Default is GPPARM GPTDEF. See the SAS/C manuals for
     all the GENPROTO options available.
     
  @{FG HIGHLIGHT}@{b}WLEFTEDGE=leftedge@{ub}@{FG TEXT}
     This is the left edge of the window position. Default is to let intuition place the window.
     
  @{FG HIGHLIGHT}@{b}WTOPEDGE=topedge@{ub}@{FG TEXT}
     This is the top edge ot the window position. Default is to let intuition place the window.
     
The workbench (3.0) doesn't seem to accept placement of an app icon. The following 2 tooltypes
can be used when the WB does place the icon according to the position specified in it, if ever.

  @{FG HIGHLIGHT}@{b}ILEFTEDGE=leftedge@{ub}@{FG TEXT}
     The left edge of the app icon.
     
  @{FG HIGHLIGHT}@{b}ITOPEDGE=topedge@{ub}@{FG TEXT}
     The top edge of the app icon.

@{b}USAGE@{ub}

When ProtoMaker is started, it will open an app-icon, unless the WINDOW tooltype is specified.
Double clicking on the icon will remove the icon and open the window. Pressing the Iconize
button in the window will remove the window and put up the icon.

The window first contains 2 boxes with string gadgets below them. The left box is for the proto
file, and the right box is for the C file. H files are always assumed to be proto files. Dropping
an H file on the window will display its icon in the left box, and the path to the file in the
string gadget below it. Dropping a C file on the window will display its icon in the right box,
and the path in the string gadget under the right box. Dropping a C file will imediately launch
the compiler to genereate protos. The protos will be put in the H file. As soon as it is done
the C file icon and its path will be removed from the right box.

In the window there are alternatives to drag and drop. You can specify a path manualy in the string
gadgets, or you can double click in the icon boxes to get a file requester.

To create a new proto file, either specify its name in the left string gadget, or use the file
requester. SC:icons/def_p icon will be used, and created in the specified path. SAS/C dosn't 
include a def_p icon, so you have to put one there yourself (you can just copy def_h if you dont
have any better icon).

Under the icon boxes and path string gadgets there is a string gadget containing the GENPROTO
options. 

The ProtoMaker icon depicts a protomaker machine. Input files are dropped in from the top, and the
result ar kicked out on the right. The icon displayed on startup displays an inactive empty machine.
When you drop a .h file on it, the icon will be changed, and an H can be seen loaded in the machine.
When you drop a .c file on it, the icon image will change again to show it is processing a C file.
When the processing of the C file is done the icon will change back the the previous image. (Yes,
I had a little bit of fun here. You might also notice that I'm not very good at drawing. ;-)

ProtoMaker lets you put the proto declarations from several C files into the same H file. After
specifying a proto H file you can drop as many C files as you want. If you need to regenerate
protos for one C file, first drop the H file, and then the C file. The protos for that C file
will be replaced in the H file, not affecting the proto declarations for the other C files in any
way.
