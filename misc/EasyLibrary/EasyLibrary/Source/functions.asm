** Library Specific Functions
**
** These are the functions for your library, you need one for every function
** in the table functable.i These can either be straight Asm functions, or
** tags to C functions in other code you link in. If you're using C to write
** the functions, you must put an XDEF in library.i for every C function
** you use.
