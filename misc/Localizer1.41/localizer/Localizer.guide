@node "Introduction" "Introduction"

 @{i}Localizer @{ui}has been created to help both programmers and translators.

 Here is a brief list of what @{i}Localizer @{ui}can do:
    · scans source files, extracts locale IDs and builds a .cd file;
    · merges old and new .cd and .ct files and hilights differences for fast editing;
    · builds C source files to handle locale stuff;
    · can add comments to each .cd ID, useful for translators;
    · builds .catalog files;
    · fast load/save of projects;
    · bubble help for each gadget;
    · quickly moves among new/changed entries for fast update of .cd and .ct files;
    · and even more...

@endnode

@node "System_Requirements" "System Requirements"

 @{i}Localizer @{ui}needs:

 · A 68020 or better
 · AmigaOS 3.0 or better
 · MUI 3.8 or better
@endnode

@node "Installation" "Installation"

 Installing @{i}Localizer @{ui}is really easy: just launch the supplied installer script!
 If you don't want to use the script you can just copy the Localizer drawer wherever
you want and copy the files in the libs drawer to the MUI:libs/mui/ one.

@endnode

@node "MainWindow" "Main Window"

 This is the main window of Localizer, you can access all functions from here.

 Localizer does not use any menu.
 All gadgets have an associated bubble help with a brief description of their use.
 All time consuming operations will be noticed with the usual busy pointer.
 The window title bar will show the name of the currently loaded project or "---" if no
project is currently loaded or the project has no name.
@endnode

@node "InfoWindow" "Info Window         "

 This window displays copyright notes about @{i}Localizer @{ui}and MUI and @{"my addresses" link "Author_info" 0}.
@endnode

@node "EditProject" "Edit Project        "

 Here you can edit all the necessary options to work with @{i}Localizer @{ui}.

 @{b}Project name.@{ub}
 This name will be used as a prefix for .cd, .ct and .catalog files.
 For example if you write 'test', @{i}Localizer @{ui}will read and write test.cd,
test.ct, test.catalog.

 @{b}Scanner.@{ub}
 From version 1.24 Localizer offers 2 different source scanners.
 The ID scanner is the same of the previous Localizer version; it scans the source code
 to look for strings starting with the characters specified in the string gadget besides
 the scanner cycle gadget.
 Remember: ALL AND ONLY the locale IDs MUST use this prefix.
 For example if you write 'MSG_', Localizer will get strings like MSG_OK, 
 MSG_GADGET_CONTINUE, etc.
 The Func scanner, instead, will look for fake functions whose name is specified in the
 above mentioned string gadget.
 If you specify 'STRING' as the fake function name, the scanner will look at functions
 with this syntax: STRING(<locale ID>,<default string>).
 So you can have functions like: STRING(MSG_OK,"OK").
 Thanks to this syntax Localizer can completely build the .cd file from your source
 code, both the IDs and the default strings! You don't have to write the strings by hand
 in the .cd file anymore, everything is inside your source, saving a lot of time and
 boring work!

 @{b}Locale source dir.@{ub}
 In this directory @{i}Localizer @{ui}will save the C source code it generates.
 Localizer generates source code for both type of scanners.

 @{b}Source files.@{ub}
 Here you can specify the source file Localizer will scan.
 The list supports multiselection and you can sort the entries with drag & drop.
 The Add button opens a standard asl requester where you can select one or more
 source files.
 The Del button removes all selected files from the list.
 The Clear button will remove all files from the list.

 @{b}Catalogs dir.@{ub}
 This is the directory which contains all the .cd, .ct and .catalog files in
 the standard locale structure.
 That is, if you write 'RAM:' and the project name is 'test', @{i}Localizer @{ui}will
 search, for example, RAM:test.cd, RAM:italiano/test.ct or RAM:italiano/test.catalog.
 The catalogs directory contains the .cd file and the directories named after
 their language. These directories contain the .ct and .catalog files.
@endnode

@node "LoadProject" " Load Project"

 Here you can load a new project.
 The list displays all the currently available projects.
 You can select a project in the list or write its name in the string gadget below.
 Press OK to load the project or Cancel to abort the operation.
 From Localizer 1.24 there is also a Del gadget besides the string gadget. It will be
 enabled only when the string gadget contains the name of an existing project file.
 The close window gadget acts just like the Cancel button.
@endnode

@node "SaveProject" "Save Project"

 Here you can save the project you are currently working on.
 The list displays all the currently available projects.
 You can select a project in the list or write its name in the string gadget below.
 If a project with the selected name already exists, it will be overwritten.
 From Localizer 1.24 there is also a Del gadget besides the string gadget. It will be
 enabled only when the string gadget contains the name of an existing project file.
 Press OK to save the project or Cancel to abort the operation.
 The close window gadget acts just like the Cancel button.
@endnode

@node "ScanSources" "Scan Sources"

 As soon as you press the Scan Sources button in the main window, @{i}Localizer @{ui}will
 start scanning your source files.
 A small window will display the status of the operation: number of scanned files
 and total number of files.
 You can't currently abort this operation, sorry.
 The scanner function generates a file with the .newcd extension in your catalogs
 directory. This file will be read when you use the @{"Edit Strings" link "EditStrings" 0} function.
@endnode

@node "EditStrings" "Edit Strings"

 Here you can finally edit your .cd file.
 Localizer will look at both a .newcd file and a .cd file.
 If only a .newcd file exists, it will load it and sort entries alphabetically.
 If only a .cd file exists, it will simply load it.
 If both a .newcd and a .cd file exist, it will merge them, unless the .newcd file has
 the archive bit set.
 If an entry is present only in the .newcd file, it will be marked as NEW.
 If an entry is present only in the .cd file, it will be removed.
 If an entry is present in both files, it will be marked as OK.

 @{b}Author.@{ub}
 Enter here the author name.

 @{b}Language.@{ub}
 Select the language for this .cd file.
 Either enter it in the string gadget or select one from the popup list.

 @{b}Version.@{ub}
 Enter the version number of this .cd file.

 @{b}IDs list.@{ub}
 This list displays all available IDs.
 It's divided in 4 columns: they contain the ID name, the id number, the status of 
 this ID(see below) and the text of this ID.

 There are 4 possible status codes:
    New (the ID has just been added after the last scan),
    Updated (the entry was updated/changed in this session)
    Empty (no text),
    OK (self explanatory :-).

 You can change the size of the columns by clicking on the vertical separator bar
 which divides the columns in the list title bar and moving the mouse.
 Or you can change their order by clicking on the column title and moving the mouse.
 You can also drag sort the entries.
 In all cases(add, delete, copy or sort) the ID numbers will be correclty updated to
 avoid errors suh s two entries with the same ID value.

 @{b}ID String.@{ub}
 You can change the ID name here.

 @{b}Add.@{ub}
 Adds a new id before the currently selected entry.

 @{b}Del.@{ub}
 Deletes the currently selected entry.

 @{b}Copy.@{ub}
 Makes a copy of the currently selected entry.

 @{b}Text String.@{ub}
 In this text editor you can enter the text of the currently selected ID.
 When this gadget is active, yuo can move through the entries of the list with the  
 left amiga + cursor up or down keys.
 You can enter @{"escape sequences" link "Escapes" 0} here.

 @{b}Min Lenght.@{ub}
 Here you can select the min lenght that the translated text(in the corresponding 
.ct file) must have.
 You can enable and disable this option with the checkbox gadget on the left.

 @{b}Max Lenght.@{ub}
 Here you can select the max lenght that the translated text(in the corresponding 
.ct file) must have.
 You can enable and disable this option with the checkbox gadget on the left.

 @{b}ID Value.@{ub}
 Here you can choose the numeric value associated with this ID.
 If the checkbox is disabled a default value will be chosen by @{i}Localizer.@{ui}

 @{b}Next.@{ub}
 When you press this gadget @{i}Localizer @{ui}will jump to the next New or  Empty entry if any,
 unless the current entry is still New or Empty.

 @{b}Prev.@{ub}
 When you press this gadget @{i}Localizer @{ui}will jump to the Previous New or Empty entry if
 any, unless the current entry is still New or Empty.

 @{b}Search.@{ub}
 When you press this gadget @{i}Localizer @{ui}will open the @{"search window" link "SearchWindow" 0}.

 @{b}Preview.@{ub}
 When you press this gadget @{i}Localizer @{ui}will open the @{"preview window" link "PreviewWindow" 0}(if not already
 open) and display a preview of the current entry.

 @{b}Comment String.@{ub}
 Here you can enter a comment string for the current ID. It's useful when you  have to 
 send the .cd file to traslators.

 @{b}Save CD.@{ub}
 It saves the .cd file over the old one. If a .newcd file exists, it will set its
 archive bit, so it won't be loaded again next time.
 When you're using the function scan mode and have updated entries, Localizer asks you if he should
 change the contents of the dummy functions in the source files to reflect the current string value
 you've given. Answer "no" to leave the sources untouched.

 @{b}Build Source.@{ub}
 It generates 2 C source files to handle the .cd file: Locale.c and Locale.h.
 They will be saved in the source dir you have selected in the @{"Edit Project window" link "EditProject" 0}
 or you can change both the path and file name in the file requester @{i}Localizer@{ui} will
 display before generating the files.
 There are 3 functions to open the catalog, close it and get a string.

 @{b}Cancel.@{ub}
 Just cancels all changes and closes the window.
 The close gadget does the same function.
 If any string has been modified, it will put up a requester asking for confirmation
 before closing the window.
@endnode

@node "TranslateStrings" "Translate Strings"

 Here you can select the language of the .ct file you want to edit or create.

 @{b}Select Language window.@{ub}

 The list displays the languages a .ct file exists for.
 You can select a language in the list, type its name in the string gadget or select 
 it from the popup list.
 If you press Cancel or the close window button, the operation is cancelled.
 If you press OK, the Translate window opens.
 It's not too much different from the Edit Strings window.


 @{b}Translate strings window.@{ub}

 Localizer will look at both a .cd file and a .ct file.
 If only a .cd file exists, it will simply load it.
 If only a .ct file exists, it will simply load it, if the .ct file has not been
 generated by Localizer, it won't contain enough information to make it usable, so you
 really need the .cd file. If, instead, the .ct file has been generated by Localizer you
 won't need the .cd file anymore, because the .ct file contains all necessary
 informations.
 If both a .cd and a .cd file exist, it will merge them, unless the .cd file has the
 archive bit set.
 If an entry is present only in the .cd file, it will be marked as NEW.
 If an entry is present only in the .ct file, it will be removed.
 If an entry is present in both files, it will be marked as OK if the default string is
 the same in both files, as Changed if it is different.


 @{b}Author.@{ub}
 Enter here the author name. it will be saved in the .catalog file.

 @{b}Language.@{ub}
 Displays the language of this .ct file.

 @{b}Version.@{ub}
 Enter the version and revision number of this .ct file.

 @{b}IDs list.@{ub}
 This list displays all available IDs.
 It's divided in 4 columns: they contain the ID name, the id number, the status 
 of this ID(see below) and the ttransalted text of this ID.
 There are 5 possible status codes:
    new (the ID has just been added after the last scan),
    Empty (no text),
    Changed (the original text in the .cd file has ben changed),
    WrongSize (the string lenght is not within the min/max values),
    OK (self explanatory :-).
 You can change the size of the columns by clicking on the vertical separator bar
 which divides the columns in the list title bar and moving the mouse.
 Or you can change their order by clicking on the column title and moving the mouse.

 @{b}Text String.@{ub}
 In the list below the original text of this ID is displayed. You can mark portions
 of text with the mouse and they will be copied to the clipboard automatically.

 @{b}Translation String.@{ub}
 In the text editor below you can enter the translation for the current ID.
 When this gadget is active, yuo can move through the entries of the list with the  
 left amiga + cursor up or down keys.
 You can enter @{"escape sequences" link "Escapes" 0} here.

 @{b}Min Size.@{ub}
 Min size allowed for current entry.

 @{b}Current Size.@{ub}
 Current size of selected entry.

 @{b}Max Size.@{ub}
 Max size allowed for current entry.

 @{b}Next.@{ub}
 Goes to the next New, Changed, Empty or WrongSize entry if any, unless the current
 entry is not OK.

 @{b}Prev.@{ub}
 Goes to the previous New, Changed, Empty or WrongSize entry if any, unless the current
 entry is not OK.

 @{b}Search.@{ub}
 When you press this gadget @{i}Localizer @{ui}will open the @{"search window" link "SearchWindow" 0}.

 @{b}Preview.@{ub}
 When you press this gadget @{i}Localizer @{ui}will open the @{"preview window" link "PreviewWindow" 0}(if not already open)
 and display a preview of the current entry.

 @{b}Comment String.@{ub}
 Displays the comment for the current ID.

 @{b}Save CT.@{ub}
 It saves the .ct file over the old one. If the .cd file exists, it will set its
 archive bit, so it won't be loaded again next time.

 @{b}Build Catalog.@{ub}
 It generates the .catalog file.
 If one or more entries status is not OK, a requester will popup asking if you want to
 generate the .catalog file anyway.
 If one or more entries are empty another requester will popup asking if you want to
 generate these empty entries anyway or if you want to skip them. this is particularly
 useful for catalog translators, because they can partially translate the .cd file and
 see the original string and not an empty one for the not yet translated strings. This
 is possible because the AmigaOS locale system simply returns the default string to
 the application if it can't find the corresponding translated string in the .catalog
 file.

 @{b}Cancel.@{ub}
 Just cancels all changes and closes the window.
 The close gadget does the same function.
 If any string has been modified, it will put up a requester asking for confirmation
 before closing the window.
@endnode

@node "SearchWindow" "Search Window"

 The search window is available both when you edit cd and ct files and it's fully
 asynchronous.

 The search window in ct mode will offer you a cycle gadget at the top, so you can
 decide if you want to perform the search among the original strings or the translated
 ones.

 In the string gadget you can enter the string you want to search; the search engine
 fully supports ALL standard AmigaOS wildcards(just like AmigaDOS programs).
 Due to this usefull feature, if you want to search a substring inside your ones, you
 have to surround it with the '#?' sequence. For example to search for 'prog' you have
 to type '#?prog#?'.
 With the case cycle gadget you can perform a case sensitive or insensitive search.
 The 3 bottom gadgets finally perform the search operation:
 the 'All' button searches from the first string in the list;
 the 'Next' button searches forward from the currently selected entry in the list;
 the 'Prev' button searches backward from the currently selected entry in the list.

 You can close and reopen the window at any time and it will preserve its contents.
@endnode

@node "PreviewWindow" "Preview Window"

 The preview window is available both when you edit cd and ct files and it's fully
 asynchronous.

 The preview window in ct mode will offer you a cycle gadget at the top, so you can
 decide if you want to preview the original strings or the translated ones. You can so
 quickly switch between a preview of the original string and of its translation with a
 simple click on this button!

 The text area below will display the parsed string(as saved in the catalog file) of
 the currently selected entry.

@node "History" "History"

 Version 1.41
    · project ported to storm gcc
    · increase the maximum size of one catalog sting from 8192 bytes to 81920 bytes

 Version 1.40
    · some bugfixes of Carsten for Tales of Tamar

 Version 1.39
    · Reworked source scanning code. No more empty strings or Enforcer/CyberGuard
      hits while scanning
    · Now the date is written correctly to the CD/CT files
    · Added Updated-Flag to CD entries
    · Added automatic changing of source code when using func definitions and
      changing the original strings inside Localizer
    · Added some more languages
    · Added some nice and worthless menus

 Version 1.38
    · fixed an evil bug in the ct loading code, which could corrupt the ID numbers;
    · changed the shortcut keys in the cd and ct windows;
    · added 2 new shortcut keys which perform the same action of the next and prev
      gadgets;
    · now the cd and ct gadgets in the main window will always be ghosted when no
      newcd or cd file is available, thus avoiding possible dead locks fi they are
      pressed and no file exists.

 Version 1.37
    · the author string gadget is bigger, 120 characters;
    · the preview window in both the cd and ct windows is updated automatically when
      you edit the text;
    · sped up opening of both the cd and ct windows;
    · performed various code optimizations and cleanups.

 Version 1.36
    · the ID string gadget is now wider;
    · avoids merging .newcd and .cd files or .cd and .ct files when not necessary;
    · added installer script.

      gadget;
    · now you can't make the min lenght of the string bigger than max lenght or
      viceversa any more;
    · now you can add, delete, copy and drag sort entries in the edit cd window;
    · when generating the catalog file, it asks if you want to skip empty entries in
      the ct file. This is useful to test partially translated ct files, because you
      won't get empty text for the untraslated entries, but the default strings.

 Version 1.34beta (public beta)
    · opening of the cd and ct edit windows is now faster;
    · now uses TextEditor class by Allan Odgaard for editing strings;
    · you can now change the active entry in both the cd and ct edit windows with the
      left Amiga + cursor up/down keys.

    · now uses the NList classes by Gilles Masson.

 Version 1.32beta (public beta)
    · fixed a couple of bugs in the function scanner;
    · changed the shortcut key for the search function, due to conflict with another
      key;
