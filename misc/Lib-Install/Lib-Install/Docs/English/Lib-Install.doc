Description
-----------

Lib-Install is an installer script for Amiga shared libraries that is highly
modular to be reusable for other installer scripts.

Lib-Install features:

- Follows the V43 Installer Style Guide
- Correctly supports the different user levels
- Install new/update mode
- Uninstallation
- Supports Installers prior to V43
- Highly automated
- Very flexible
- Very intelligent (for an installer-script ;-)
- It uses WrapGuide (if present) for the  documentation if running
  under a pre V39 system.
- Autodetects the CPU/FPU
- Autodetects the OS version
- Autodetects existing files within the distribution archive
- Installs the optimal 68010-68060 binary if available
- It supports the following languages:
  English, German
- Supports source code installation for the following programming languages:
  C, Assembler, Amiga-E, Modula II, Oberon, ARexx
- It can be reused by (hopefully) all other Amiga shared libraries since the
  authors of shared libraries need to change only a few things:
  * The #copyright variable
  * The #min_os_version and #min_os_revision variables
  * The #language variable
  * The P_CustomExists, P_CustomInstall and P_CustomUninstall procedures
  * The 'APPNAME' tooltype within the Lib-Install icon
