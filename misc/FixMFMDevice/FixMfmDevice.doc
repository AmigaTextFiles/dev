*************
Distribution:
*************
It is forbidden to include this on a magazine coverdisk without first
writing to me to make sure you include the latest version, and also,
I want a copy of the magazine featuring FixMFMDevice.
No other limitations are implied on this distribution.


************
Requirements
************
Any Amiga, with CrossDOS.
XfdMaster [Optional]
Reqtools  [Only necessary if XFD is used]


***********
BackGround:
***********
Every version of CrossDOS I've seen has a bug in the LibOpen() routine.
It uses the d3 register, but doesn't save/restore it before/after using it.
This program will edit the mfm.device to fix this bug. It changes just two
bytes.

Although this bug is not fatal, it can cause problems, as I found out when I
recently wrote a program which used PC disks, after reading a file, d3 was
trashed, and I couldn't figure why, till I disassembled mfm.device.


******
Usage:
******
Just run the patch from a shell, and it will rename your old DEVS:mfm.device as
DEVS:mfm.device.old, and create a new debugged file called DEVS:mfm.device
If the file is packed, then it will be depacked if you have the xfd package
installed (Available on Aminet)


********
History:
********
v1.0: Release date 20-Sep-96
 First version.

v1.1: Release date 03-Nov-96
 BugFix - Removed enforcer hit.

*******
Future:
*******
I'm unaware of any other bugs in mfm.device, if I find any I'd fix them!
Maybe I'll add some speed-patches one day.. but I don't think I'd be able
to speed it up much without considerably rewriting it.
