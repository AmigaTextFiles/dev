ADocReader is FREEWARE and will stay free !   :-)
You can use it without paying any fee, anyway i'm not against it !  ;-)


Introduction
------------

ADocReader is an autodoc reader which make and use a database which
contain cross reference from autodoc and include files.

It means that when you double click on a word, it search in its base
for an autodoc entry or file, include file, define, typedef, struct
and open and show you the good file at the good line.
You can enter a string to find references about it. If more than one
reference as been found, you get a list of them and can select one
entry to see it.

You can select lines (not words, line only) and copy them
to the clipboard 0.

An history is made with all references where you went, which are
selectable on a list.


Use
---

You should go to the config window first, then change dirs string
contents (use some assign if your path is large, it's more readable
at use). Default starting drawer is needed.
If you want to make an XRef file, you should give xrefs, autodoc
entries and dir list files names, and some of autodocs and include
dirs names. Then push Make Xref and wait... When done, you can
make xref searches from it's window or just double clicking one
some word.

from CLI, you can use:
adocreader [ALL]  or   adocreader file.doc   or   adocreader [ALL] DIR dirpath
to see a specific file or start with some specific drawer.
Use ALL if you don't want only .doc files to be viewables in the start dir list.

Those who made the xref file with the 0.1 release should remake it !


Requirements
------------

I don't know exactly. It was made with kick 3.0, MUI 3.3, gcc2.7.0
with libnix (you don't need ixemul.library).

I suppose that kick 3.0+ and MUI 3.1+ are needed.

ADocReader is memory hungry  :-(, my XRef file is 340 Kb big and use
about 400 Kb in RAM when loaded.


Future
------

It's a prerelease, some things have not been made.

- Find word in current entry.

- possibility to search xrefs from the xref file without loading it.
  (only if someone ask it to me)

- a real new mui custom class which will handle better the horizontal
  scrollbar. If i succeed in, i'll make a free public class with it.
  Currently, i use a list/listview child and simulate the horizontal
  scrolling changing what the displayhook return  :-(

- add AREXX for direct xref word ask from editors.


If you think about other changes, tell me...



If you like it, mail me... give me something... as you want.
And if you don't like it, mail me why !




ADocReader is based for the idea and the sources on :
