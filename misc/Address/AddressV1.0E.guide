At first I have to say one thing: This is not(!!) an address bank. It is a tool
for programmers, who want to have a look into the computer addresses. Other
people may use the program too, of course.

When programming it some times is necessary to look into some computer addresses,
but this was difficult until now. This tool shall change this now, because it
has a little GUI (Graphik User Interface).

@node "Mail-Ware" "Mail-Ware"

   @{b}@{u}Mail-Ware@{ub}@{uu}

This program is mail-ware.

Therefore: If you want to use this program please send @{"me" link "Adresse" 0} a mail.

If you find any bugs or have a good idea, send this too. If I get enough mails,
I will spend more time with this program. It depends on you...

The program can do the following things:

 - direct input of the address

 - counting up and down the address in three different steps

 - Display the contents of the address as a decimal-, hexadecimal- and as a
   binary number.

 - Display in three lengths: Byte, Word and Long

 - The display is refreshed permanently, this means you see every change in
   the address directly (e.g. moving the mouse)

The installation is very simple: you only have to copy the drawer which contains
the program on your harddisk wherever you want. No assign or so.

Thats all :-)

@node "Start" "Starting"

   @{b}@{u}Starting@{ub}@{uu}

How to start the program?

Just double click on the icon on the Workbench. There are no tooltypes or
arguments.

@node "Bedienung" "Handling"

   @{b}@{u}Handling@{ub}@{uu}

After starting the program you see the following window with much gadgets
on the screen. The window is build as a table:

 +------------------------------------------------------------------+
 | Quit          DEC          HEX        BIN                        |
 | /\\ \\/   BYTE: 0            0          00000000                   |
 | /\\ \\/   WORD: 0            0          0000000000000000           |
 | /\\ \\/ @ LONG: 0            0          000000000000000000000000~0 |
 |                                                ___________       |
 | Basicaddress:1DC0D6E0 + 0   Address:1DC0D6E0  [___________]      |
 +------------------------------------------------------------------+

At the bottom of the window, the basicaddress is shown. When the program is
started, the adress is the Intuition Screen, the current screen. After the
"+" you see how many bytes the basicaddress was incremented or decremented.
Behind "Address:" you see the current address from that reading starts.
To change the basicaddress, type down an address as a @{u}decimal number(!!)@{uu}
into the input field. Pressing the <Return> key will start the reading and
the displaying.

Below the shortcut "DEC","HEX" and "BIN" there is the value as decimal ("DEC",
e.g. "34134"), as hexadecimal ("HEX", e.g. "12AB34C") and as binary number
("BIN", e.g. "0100110101").

Every line shows the value assuming a different length. Anyway, reading starts
from the same address, displayed at "Address".

Byte = 8  Bit
Word = 16 Bit
Long = 32 Bit

To count up or down the address, you have to click on the buttons "/\\" or "\\/".
The address will be counted up or down one byte, one word or one long.

When you press the button "@" the program will jump to the address, displayed
beside "LONG". Should in a structure be a pointer to another address, you
can jump to it directly. But @{u}attention@{uu}: a long value is not necessary
a valid address.

Leading zeros are displayed every time (000101 instead of 101).

"Quit"  : I think, I have nothing to say about it...

It has to be there...

The author does not take any liability for mistakes in this program or damage
at your machine. I don't make any guarantee that the program is running 100%
corectly. The program with all it's addendums is © 1997 by Malte Ried.

The program is @{"Mail-Ware" link "Mail-Ware" 0}. That means, you may copy it and give it to any person
you want, if you write @{"me" link "Adresse" 0} a mail, a post-card or so. The program may be included
at every PD-colection if one disc don't costs more than 7 US-$. The
program-package may not be changed.
