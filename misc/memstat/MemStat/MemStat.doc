Hi there.. 

This is MemStat V0.1 , a little Tool i've written because i wanted
to know something about Memory-Fragmentation in the Amiga.

------------------------ Legal hurtz ----------------------------

This Program is Giftware. If you like it, sent any gifts to me.
(cans of bex, chicks, 060-processor boards or anything you like ;)) 

You may give the Program to anyone but only on a non-profit-basis.

Use the Program on your own risk ! Don't blame me for any harm
the Proggy has done to you or you Computer ;))


----------- Why do i need to know about mem-fragmentation--------

Well.. Its a question of system performance. If your Program causes
bad memory fragmentation, all programs using memory in a dynamic way 
will slow down !

(The more memory is fragmented, the longer exec has to search for a 
fitting memory block on a memory request)


------------------ Here a example output: -----------------------

 Node 0 at  8000000 Pri=  40 ATT= 505    8741792 Bytes in   376 Chunks     
   182 Chunk(s) with Length >        8 Searchlength =     0
    24 Chunk(s) with Length >       10 Searchlength =     0
    32 Chunk(s) with Length >       20 Searchlength =    82
    31 Chunk(s) with Length >       40 Searchlength =   177
    23 Chunk(s) with Length >       80 Searchlength =   206
    31 Chunk(s) with Length >      100 Searchlength =   207
    13 Chunk(s) with Length >      200 Searchlength =   207
    12 Chunk(s) with Length >      400 Searchlength =   238
    12 Chunk(s) with Length >      800 Searchlength =   249
     6 Chunk(s) with Length >     1000 Searchlength =   280
     3 Chunk(s) with Length >     2000 Searchlength =   285
     5 Chunk(s) with Length >     4000 Searchlength =   285
     1 Chunk(s) with Length >     8000 Searchlength =   374
     1 Chunk(s) with Length >   400000 Searchlength =   375
 Node 1 at     2000 Pri= -10 ATT= 703    2020200 Bytes in     8 Chunks
     1 Chunk(s) with Length >        8 Searchlength =     0
     1 Chunk(s) with Length >       20 Searchlength =     1
     4 Chunk(s) with Length >       40 Searchlength =     1
     1 Chunk(s) with Length >     2000 Searchlength =     6
     1 Chunk(s) with Length >   100000 Searchlength =     7

------------ Now, what's all that stuff above ? -------------------

Listed are (up to 32 ;) Memory Nodes in decreasing priority
Node 0 is my 32Bit Fast Mem on the Warpengine Processor Board,
Node 1 is the well used ;) Chip mem.

below the Nodes are the memory chunks MemStat has found.

Example 1:

"   182 Chunk(s) with Length >        8 Searchlength =     0 "
means, that there are 182 MemChunks with a length larger than 0x00000008,
but smaller than 0x00000010. 

The  searchlength indicates, how many Entries have to be read to get 
a Block of 8..15 Bytes. (in this case the first try will get a block)

Example 2:

"     6 Chunk(s) with Length >     1000 Searchlength =   280 "
means, that there are 6 chunks with a length between 0x0001000 and 0x0002000,
and AllocMem will have to search at least 280! MemChunks to get such a 
Block ..


------------------------- further versions -------------------------

Hmm.. perhaps i should add a little gui.. show the fragmentation 
in a graphic way..
