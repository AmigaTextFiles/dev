## AUTODOC-IT 1.13 - THE PROGRAMMERS GUIDE
##
## This is a first approach to get ALL those autodocs linked together with
## amigaguide, the new document-help-format by Commodore.
## With amigaguide, you should have received some utilities, which
## are useful for converting autodoc-compatible (!) textfiles into the
## amigaguide/hypertext format.
## Do not use this database without having converted those files or
## autodoc-it will not work.
## Please read the short manual: Getting_Started.doc before using
## autodoc-it.
## Not included in this archive are, of course, the amigaguide package and
## the autodoc-files, because they are © by Commodore and available only to
## registered developers!
##
## You may redistribute this database and use it anyway you like, as long as this
## header and all files (see archive.txt) stay in it. Take a look at the docs
## for the copyright notice.
##
## Following are the non-system doc files supported (you have to convert
## the appropriate doc files included in the several packages of the
## programs:
##
## - reqtools
## - iff.library
## - appshell (DEVCON)

@node about "About Autodoc-It"

AUTODOC-IT helps you to control all those autodoc-files you have
generated with @{"ad2ht" link ad2ht}.

It presents the @{"autodocs" link adoc} in a way that you do not
need to load every autodoc when you need its specific information.
Just click on the reference you want information about and then return
to your programming environment.

Always use the "Retrace"-Gadget to get back from a subitem.
Use the HELP-Key to display some help about the Amigaguide-Reader
itsself. To return to AUTODOC-IT, just click the lower (!) close-
gadget.

Version history:
================

New features for version 1.0: 
-----------------------------

- first release, nothing much to say about this one

New features for version 1.01:
------------------------------

- corrected some minor bugs  

New features for version 1.10:
------------------------------

- found some typing-mismatches. 
- changed 'link amiga.lib' to 'link amiga_lib'...
- added credits

New features for version 1.11:
------------------------------

- changed user interface design (thanks to T.Strauﬂ)
- updated installation information (some guys had problems with
  cross-references (most of them did not read the manuals of amigaguide...). 
- corrected some minor bugs 
- added 2.0 version string
- added version history
- added arexx-script (T.Strauss) for cross reference feature, it does not
  work if include: cannot be found (see above). Use this script at your own
  risk. You do not need it, if you follow the converting instructions of
  AD2HT correctly!

New features for version 1.12:
------------------------------

- added reqtools (cross reference should work: try "screen" in
  'rteasyrequesta', it should find 'intuition/screens.h'). The reqtools
  converted file is not included, cause it is too long (>20000 bytes) for
  'z-netz/amiga/bin'. You should be able to convert it on your own anyway.


New features for version 1.13:
------------------------------

- added Workbench 2.1 enhancements (bullet.doc, appshell.doc)
  Please convert your autodoc-files supplied with the 2.1 package with AD2HT
  accordingly: asl.doc, bullet.doc, locale.doc, commodities.doc

- added iff.library (convert ifflib.doc included in the ifflib release)

@node adoc "About Autodocs"

Autodocs are programmer maintained documents that are embedded in the
source code for an application, utility or system software.  Using a
special tool called Autodoc (located on DevCon disks and the Software
Toolkit) these documents can be extracted from the source, indexed,
alphabetized and placed in a human-readable form.
@endnode

@node ad2ht "About"

AD2HT is fully documented in the amigaguide reference guide. It is used
to convert your autodoc-compatible doc-files into hypertext format.

Note however, that you must have your C_Includes in a directory 'include'
or any directory assigned to 'include', to let AD2HT find them. If you
convert your @{"autodocs" link adoc} without regarding this,
cross-references will not work with AUTODOC-IT!

@endnode

@node Credits "Credits"
Credits for help, suggestions, flames etc... must go to the following
persons:

Thomas Strauﬂ    - for realizing additional features, testing and critizism

And Commodore for the amigaguide-package.
