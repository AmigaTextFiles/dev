@Node "Lr_Alloc" "LineReq.Library/Lr_Alloc()"

   NAME
    Lr_Alloc()  -- Alloc LineReq Stuff. (V1)


   SYNOPSIS
    result := Lr_Alloc()

    ULONG  Lr_Alloc( void );
    D0

   FUNCTION
    This routine allocs all needed stuff and initialize LineReq library.


   INPUTS

   RESULTS
    result          - This could be:
                        TRUE  =  CORRECT initialization.
                        FALSE =  INCORRECT init.  (Should NEVER happen!)


   NOTES
    Call this routine EXACTLY ONCE at startup! And also remember you HAVE
    to call also @{" Lr_SetScreen() " LINK "Lr_SetScreen"} before attemping
    to open a requester!

   SYNOPSIS
    Lr_Dispose()

    VOID Lr_Dispose( void );

   FUNCTION
    This routine frees all alloc()ated stuff. Use this to free everything 
    before closing the library.


   INPUTS

   RESULTS

   NOTES
    It is not so dangerous not to call this routine before exiting. You will 
    only have:

        - gadtools.library opened one more time...

        - 16 Bytes lost.

        - Maybe a screen locked.

    LineReq.Library V1.00 - (C)1995 By Fabio Rotondo

    *** NOTE: This library is dedicated to all Amiga fanatics around the  ***
    ***       world. Please, continue developing for this machine now and ***
    ***       forever. All Amiga community needs you. (And keep prices    ***
    ***       as low as possible!! ;)                                     ***

                      *** AMIGA. Feel The Power !!! ***

    This is a very small library I have written to overcome some ASL library
    lacks.

    I have always found useful the string/number requester present in the
    reqtools.library by Nico Francois, but you cannot create COMMERCIAL
    product with this library because it is not free. So, for my SHAREWARE
    or COMMERCIAL products I have always used the ASL library... even if I
    do not like it.

    Then, some time ago, I needed a STRING requester, but it was impossible to
    be done using the ASL library... and here comes my LineReq.library.

    LineReq.library creates One-Line-Requesters, such as STRING/NUMBER
    requesters present in reqtools.library.
    Main features are:

        * Multi Line Body   -- You can insert a body text longer than just
                               one single line, just separe text using
                               an ASCII 10 char.

        * HELP! Gadget      -- You can specify an Help text which will be
                               displayed when the user presses the HELP!
                               gadget. (If no help text, the gadget will not
                               be created)

        * Enforcer's hits free!!  -- No errors here!

        * It is FAST        -- No MUI-Like delays in designing the requester!

        * It is SHORT       -- About 5K of wonder!

        * It is TOTALLY FREE!!! -- You can use it in your own PD, SHAREWARE or
                                   COMMERCIAL programs without having to give
                                   my anything!!!
                                   (If you wish, you could send me a copy of
                                    your program.... ;)


    I hope these features will match all your needs.

    Anyway, I do intend to continue developing this library, so if you want
    any new feature... just write me and we will sort things out!

    TECH NOTES

    There are a few things you _should_ know before using this library.

    This wonder has been written using AmigaE V3.2a by Wouter van Oortnerssen.
    In the docs Wouter warns this:

    (from E.Guide)

       libraries created by E should be opened/closed by
   any one task EXACTLY ONCE, not more, not less (this shouldn't pose any
   problems though).  If you put your library in the PD, you will want to put a
   programmers notice in your docs mentioning this.  Strange things WILL happen
   if you don't obey this rule.



    In the Lr_Alloc() routine, the Library does the following things:

        * Opens GadTools.library

        * Set default font to topaz.font 8

        * Resets some vars to 0
