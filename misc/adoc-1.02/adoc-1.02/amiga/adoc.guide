GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  675
     Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

 10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,
you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

Introduction
************

The `ADOC' scanner creates Autodocs or Texinfo source from source code.
It is an enhanced version of Bill Koesters `Autodoc' program as of
21-Aug-89 which is part of C=ommodore's Native Developer Kit (NDK).

`ADOC' scans the input files for a special kind of comments: the autodoc
comments.  Autodoc comments start at the begining of a line with a
string of the form

     ?***??* lib/fun ...

The `?' stands for characters which are ignored, they must however be
"black", i.e. they must not be tabs or spaces.  The `*' ist ment
literally, so in these places there must be an asterisk.  `lib/fun' is
the identifier which specifies the library and the name of the function
described in the following comment.  `lib' and `fun' consist of upper-
and/or lower case letters, decimal digits, a dash `-' and/or the
underscore `_'.  The rest of the line is ignored.

E.g.: A standard C language autodoc comment begins like this:

     /****** mylib/myfun **************************

The following lines make up the function description, a sequence of one
or more sections.  A section begins with the section heading, a line
with only -- and at least two -- capital letters.  Some common section
headings are

     NAME, SYNOPSIS, FUNCTION, INPUTS, RESULT, ...

Each line in the function description must be prefixed with a black
character followed by at least one white space or the end of the line.
An autodoc comment ends with a line beginning with a black character
followed by at least two asterisks `*'.  An example template comment
can be found at the end of this document.  See @{"Style Guide" Link "Style Guide"}, for further
details.

Options
*******

`ADOC' reads the command line from left to right and collects filenames
and options before it starts processing your input.  The filenames are
queued and processed in the same order as they appear in the command
line.  The list-file option `@' is replaced by the contents of the list
file read in top-down order. If no input files are specified `ADOC'
will read from the standard input stream.

Options for the `Autodoc' output
================================

`--autodoc'
     `ADOC' creates an autodoc file. (This is the default)

`--no-form-feeds'
     Usually the functions in `ADOC's autodoc output are seperated by
     form feeds (`^L').  With this switch `ADOC' omits them.  (This
     switch is a no-op in `--texinfo' mode).

`--table-of-contents'
     A table of contents is written to the output followed by the
     autodoc functions.  Functions and toc-entries are always in the
     same order, so `--preserve-order' also affects the table of
     contents.  (This switch is a no-op in `--texinfo' mode).

`--preserve-order'
     With this option `ADOC' does not sort the functions before writing
     the autodoc output.  (This switch is ignored in `--texinfo' mode).

Options for `Autodoc' and `Texinfo' output
==========================================

`--stdin'
     This switch behaves like a filename for the standard input stream.
     Using it does not only force reading from stdin but you can also
     specify the files to read before and after the standard input.

`--output-file FILENAME'
     This option allows you to specify a filename for `ADOC''s output.
     If this option is ommited `ADOC' will write to the standard output
     stream.

`--error-file FILENAME'
     Like `--output-file' this option allows you to redirect `ADOC''s
     output.  The difference between the two is that this option
     redirects warnings and error messages from stderr into the file
     FILENAME.

`--flip-slashes'
     This option converts `\\*' to `/*' and `*\\' to `*/'.  This allows C
     language comments in the autodocs without nesting comments in the
     source code.

     The name of the option might give you the idea of a general
     conversion of backslashes into slashes.  This is however incorrect.
     The character on the left or right of the `\\' must be an asterisk
     (`*').  Please note that `*\\*' is transformed into `*/*'.

`--tabs-to-spaces'
     Tabs in the input are turned into spaces with a default tab size
     of 8.  This is the default in `--texinfo' mode.

`--tabsize NUMBER'
     The tab size is changed to NUMBER.  (default is `--tabsize 8').
     This option implies `--tabs-to-spaces'.

`--line-length NUMBER'
     Function headers in the autodoc output will be NUMBER columns
     wide.  (default is `--line-length 80').  (This option has no
     influence on `ADOC''s Texinfo output).

`--internal'
     `ADOC' will only read comments with an `i' in column 5 or 6.
     (same as `--yank-type "i"').

`--yank-type TYPE'
     `ADOC' will only read comments which have in column 5 or 6 one of
     the chatacters in the TYPE string.

`--indented-comments'
     The autodoc comments normally have to start at column 1, i.e.: they
     must not be indented.  This option allows indented comments, but it
     does not check whether or not the indentation of all comment lines
     is equal or not.

     Additionally, if the indentation is not a multiple of `ADOC''s tab
     size, the conversion of TAB characters into spaces might lead to
     wrong results.  This is due to the fact that `ADOC' does not
     remember the columnar position of each body text line but silently
     assumes that they all start at a tab stop column.

     In general it is *not* recommended to make use of TABs in indented
     comments.  If you really insist on them you can pipe these files
     through `expand' and `ADOC''s output through `unexpand':

          $ cat *.c | expand -t8 | adoc -I | unexpand -t8 -a > adoc.out

`--reindent-bodytext NUMBER'
     This option changes the indentation of lines in the body text of
     all functions to NUMBER spaces.  If NUMBER is 0 then the current
     indentation is removed which is default in `--texinfo' mode.

     In order to remove the current indentation `ADOC' cuts a columnar
     block beginning at column 1 from the function body.  The width of
     this block is the maximum width without hurting any text.

     There is one more thing to mention:  This option automatically
     converts all TAB characters into the apropriate number of spaces.
     You want this because the new indentation might destroy your
     textual layout otherwise.  The conversion is performed before the
     removal of the indentation.

     If you want to change the body text indentation via
     `--reindent-bodytext' but insist on having TAB characters instead
     of spaces then you have to pipe the `ADOC' output through
     `unexpand':

          $ adoc -I *.c | unexpand -t8 -a > adoc.out

`--preserve-indentation'
     This option avoids reindentation of the body text (e.g.: in
     `--texinfo' mode where `--reindent-bodytext 0' is `ADOC''s
     default).

`--sort-entries'
     This option forces sorting of the functions which is default in
     both `--autodoc' and `--texinfo' mode.

`-MMACRO VALUE'
     Defines a value VALUE for a macro MACRO which is expanded when
     writing the body text of a function.  (e.g.: the above mentioned
     conversions of for `--flip-slashes' and `--texinfo' are
     implemented in this manner).

     Note that there must *not* be a space between `-M' and the name
     (i.e. the source string) of the macro.

`-U MACRO'
     Undefines a macro MACRO no matter whether MACRO had been defined
     with `-D' or `-M' or not at all.

Options for `Texinfo' output
============================

`--texinfo'
     Write texinfo source instead of autodocs.  This switch implies
     `--tabs-to-spaces'. `--preserve-order' and `--no-form-feeds' are
     ignored.  The functions in the texinfo output are always sorted,
     tabs are always expanded and there will be no form feeds.

     Some conversions will be performed on your autodoc body text,
     especially:

          @  ->  @@
          {  ->  @\{
          }  ->  @}

`--project'
`--revision'
`--edition'
`--copyright'
`--author'
     `ADOC''s texinfo header reserves these four macros.  Their value
     defaults to their name.  `--project' is not only used on the title
     page but also as the name for the `.info' or `.guide' file.

     These options actually define the macros `PROJECT', `EDTITION',
     `REVISION', `COPYRIGHT' and `AUTHOR' as if they had been defined
     via `-D'.

`--no-references'
     In `--texinfo' mode, `ADOC' tries to find matching nodes for the
     identifiers in the `SEE ALSO' section.  You can however force
     `ADOC' to write this section as it is by giving this switch.

     Best results can be obtained by writing one reference per line in
     the same `lib/fun' format as in the header line of the referenced
     function.  `ADOC' will however try to prepend the current
     functions library name to the identifiers and removes parens,
     commata, white spaces and newline characters in order to find the
     referenced `lib/fun' header.

`--parse-references'
     This option prints one "See ..." sentence containing all references
     from the `SEE ALSO' section.  No itemization is used.

     The name of this option might insinuate the necessity of passing
     it together with other options which need to analyze the `SEE ALSO'
     section.  This is however incorrect.  The name of this option is
     somehow an archaic requilict from those times where `ADOC' learned
     to look closer at it's input.  It could also be called
     `--make-one-sentence-of-references' or something similar.

`--itemize-references'
     `ADOC' puts the parsed references as an `@item' into an `@itemize'
     environment.  (This is default in `--texinfo' mode).

     Parsing the references is done automatically, even if you guess
     that you need the `--parse-references' option.  This not a good
     guess.  Perhaps you should better look at the above description of
     this option.

`--no-grouping'
     `ADOC' will not make use of texinfo's grouping feature.  (This is
     the default).

`--group-sections'
     The section body (following the title keyword) will be grouped
     into a `@group' ... `@end group' environment in order to prevent
     TeX from breaking the page inside a section.   The current
     implementation of `texinfo' does not allow placing the section
     keyword into the `@group' as well:

          ! @group invalid in context where filling is enabled.

`--body-environment STRING'
     This option allows you to specify the texinfo environment into
     which the section body text will be placed.  The internal default
     is `--body-environment smallexample' and so each section body is
     placed into an environment of the form

          @smallexample
            <body text>
          @end smallexample

     If `--group-sections' is specified, then this `@group' is placed
     into the given environment like this:

          @smallexample
          @group
            <body text>
          @end group
          @end smallexample

     Please note that this environment is not used within parsed
     references in the `SEE ALSO' section.

`--texi-funtable'
     This switch tells the texinfo code generator to place a function
     into a `@table' environment with each section keyword as a
     `@b{}'old `@item'.  This might however look ugly and lead to an
     immense amount of overfull `\hbox{}'es because TeX will then
     indent the following body text twice (for the `@item' and for the
     `@example') and so `ADOC''s default is to write a section keyword
     like an ordinary, indented, `@b{}'old paragraph.

`--form-feeds'
     With this option a page break is forced by inserting a `@page'
     command in front of each function description.  An exception is
     the first function of a library which always begins on the same
     page as the library `@chapter'.

`--texi-header-file FILENAME'
     `ADOC' comes up with a minimal header and titlepage when writing
     texinfo output.  This option allows you to replace `ADOC''s
     internal header with the contents of FILENAME.

     Note that a macro expansion of macros defined via `-D' will be
     performed on the contents of FILENAME.

`--no-texi-header'
     This option forces `ADOC' to ommit writing a texinfo header and a
     title page.  Texinfo output begins with the (Top) `@menu'.

`--no-texi-index'
     No function index and no table of contents is used in the texinfo
     file.

`-DMACRO VALUE'
     Defines a value VALUE for a macro MACRO which is expanded when
     writing the texinfo header.  These definitions are *not* performed
     on the body text of a function description like those defined via
     `-M'.

     Note that there must *not* be a space between `-D' and the name of
     the macro.

Miscellaneous Options
=====================

`--no-output'
`--dry-run'
     `ADOC' only reads your input (and eventually prints warnings).  No
     output will be written.

`--silent'
     `ADOC' will behave more briefly with this option.

`--help'
     A list of options and a short description will be printed to the
     standard output stream.

     If your terminal is limited to 80 columns then you can use

    `-h0'
          To print only the `usage:...' line

    `-h1'
          To print only the "short" options (those with one dash `-').

    `-h2'
          To print only the "long" options (those with two dashes `--').

`--version'
     Author and version information will be printed.

Influencing `ADOC''s pedanticness
=================================

`--no-warnings'
     `ADOC' will not print *any* warnings.

`--check-keywords'
     `ADOC' will complain about section title keywords which are not in
     the example below.

`--check-presence'
     `ADOC' will complain if one of the keywords in the example below
     is missing in a function description.

`--pedantic'
     `ADOC' will complain about almost everything.

Style Guide
***********

This chapter is under development.

How `ADOC' reads your input
===========================

`ADOC' scanns your input for autodoc comments.  These comments begin on
the leftmost column in a new line which most likely looks like one of
those:

`/****** mylib/myfun ******'
     This is the beginning of a standard C or Rexx Language autodoc
     comment for the function `myfun' in the library or module `mylib'.

`;****** mylib/myfun ******'
`******* mylib/myfun ******'
     Most assemblers use a semicolon (`;') or an asterisk (`*') to
     begin a remark.

`#****** mylib/myfun ******'
     This type is known in Makefiles and shell scripts.

`%****** mylib/myfun ******'
     For autodoc comments in TeX or `METAFONT' we need the percent sign
     (`%').

When `ADOC' encounters the beginning of an autodoc comment it starts
collecting section headings and body text lines and saves them for
later use in the code generator.

The lines inside autodoc comments must be prefixed by a black character.
This character is made invisible in the output.  To be more precise:
`ADOC' removes the black character in column 1 if the following
character is a TAB or a newline character but it replaces it by a space
if the following character is a space character.

Each line which contains entirely capitalized letters is assumed to be
a section heading unless it contains only one single upper case
character.

The indentation of section headings and body text lines does not matter.
You should however use an indentation of 3 spaces for a section heading
and 7 spaces for body text lines.  Note that `ADOC' allows you to
adjust the indentation for the output via the `--reindent-bodytext'
option.

Example comment
===============

Here is a sample "correct" autodoc comment taken from the
`autodoc.style' which is part of Commodore's Native Developer Kit (NDK):

     /****** financial.library/StealMoney ***************************************
     *
     *  NAME
     *     StealMoney -- Steal money from the Federal Reserve Bank. (V77)
     *
     *  SYNOPSIS
     *     error = StealMoney( userName,amount,destAccount,falseTrail )
     *     D0,Z                D0       D1.W    A0         [A1]
     *
     *     BYTE StealMoney
     *          ( STRPTR,UWORD,struct AccountSpec *,struct falseTrail *);
     *
     *  FUNCTION
     *     Transfer money from the Federal Reserve Bank into the specified
     *     interest-earning checking account.  No records of the transaction
     *     will be retained.
     *
     *  INPUTS
     *     userName      - name to make the transaction under.
     *                     Popular favorites include "Ronald Reagan"
     *                     and "Mohamar Quadaffi".
     *     amount        - Number of dollars to transfer (in thousands).
     *     destAccount   - A filled-in AccountSpec structure detailing the
     *                     destination account (see financial/accounts.h).
     *                     If NULL, a second Great Depression will be triggered.
     *     falseTrail    - If the DA_FALSETRAIL bit is set in the destAccount,
     *                     a falseTrail structure must be provided.
     *
     *  RESULT
     *     error - zero for success, else an error code is returned (see
     *             financial/errors.h).  The Z condition code is guaranteed.
     *
     *  EXAMPLE
     *     Federal regulations prohibit a demonstration of this function.
     *
     *  NOTES
     *     Do not run on Tuesdays!
     *
     *  BUGS
     *     Before V88, this function would occasionally print the address and
     *     home phone number of the caller on local police 976 terminals.
     *     We are confident that this problem has been resolved.
     *
     *  SEE ALSO
     *     CreateAccountSpec(),security.device/SCMD_DESTROY_EVIDENCE,
     *     financial/misc.h

     *
     *  Private notes:
     *     A4=stringbean
     *     A3=dogbreath
     *  Must preserve A1 for taxshelter.library
     */

There are three spaces from the `*' to the start of each `HEADING'.
There is one tab after the `*' before the start of the body text.  No
other tabs are used.

Note that `ADOC' also allows the use of spaces to indent body text
lines.  You can even mix tabs and spaces!  (We recommend to avoid TAB
characters.)

General style notes
===================

   * It is critical that changes be noted in a sane manner.

   * When referring to a function, the standard format is
     `FunctionName()'.

   * Capitalization should be correct.  Here are some guidelines:

       1. Trademarks, *must* be capitalized.

       2. Names of "things" are as defined.  For example,
          `OpenWindow()', and "a `Window' structure".  "fiddles with
          your window" does not refer to the structure, and should not
          be capitalized.

   * Lines terminate at column 79, so the autodocs are readable from
     within an 80 column window.

For further guidelines refer to `autodoc.style' -- Commodore's autodoc
style guide which is part of the Native Developer Kit (NDK).

Bugs
****

   - Most of `ADOC''s "short" options are compatible with Bill Koester's
     `Autodoc' Program.  `-C', `-s', `-a', `-F', `-r' and `-w' are
     ignored for compatibility.

   - This documentation is far from being complete

   - Most of the options are not tested

   - The `-M' option actually does not affect the `SEE ALSO' section in
     texinfo source if parsing is enabled.  This might change in the
     future when using `funexpand()'.

   - TeX will not break a page inside of indented paragraphs in
     `@example' or `@smallexample' blocks.  The result might look ugly.
     Here is a hacky workaround for this problem:
          adoc --texinfo | sed "s/^ / /" > outfile.texi
