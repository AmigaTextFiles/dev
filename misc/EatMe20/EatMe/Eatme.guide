                            Introduction to EatMe



         EatMe is a programmer's utility for testing their programs
         under low memory situations. EatMe will allocate a user
         specified amount of memory (in bytes) to simulate a low
         memory situation.

         EatMe will give back the memory it "ate" on command.  A
         display of how much memory is left, and how much memory has
         already been taken by EatMe is available at all times.

               About EatMe from Natural Interface Solutions



Name:        EatMe
Version:     2.0
Date:        January 1994
Programmers: Sean Kormilo and Andrew Richards


Requirements:
  Kickstart and Workbench 2.0 or above


General:
  EatMe was created on a couple Amiga 3000's.

  The Graphical User Interface (GUI) was generated with
  GadToolsBox V2.0b - Copyrighted 1992-93 by Jaba Development.


Thanks To:
  Andrew, for fixing a really buggy program.  I
  wasn't initially intending on releasing it to the world
  at large.   (Sean)

  Also thanks to the folks at Commodore-Amiga who may actually
  be doing something right for a change.  Good luck with the
  CD³² guys!  And hurry up with AAA okay?    (Sean)

  Sean, for still taking most of the credit for this program, even
  though he's barely touched it!  ;-)    (Andrew)

                             How to use EatMe

     First you must start EatMe.  This can be done either by double
     clicking the icon from the Workbench, or by typing 'EatMe' at
     the CLI prompt.  Currently, EatMe does not 'detach' itself from
     the CLI.

                       How to use the EatMe Gadgets
                              Free Memory


  The Free Memory gadget indicates how much RAM is currently
  available in the system.

  The type of memory the display is valid for, depends upon
  the state of the @{"Mem Type" link MemType} gadget.  So, if Mem Type is
  set for fast RAM, the Free Memory gadget will display the amount of
  available fast RAM.

  Because memory is dynamic, the display may not always be accurate. This is
  not a bug in the program. To get the closest value as possible, make sure
  you cycle through the @{"memory types" link MemType} (to make your
  selection) before entering the value to "eat".

   The Amount To Eat gadget is used to select the amount of
   memory you wish to take.  Simply enter the desired amount
   using the keyboard.

                       How to use the EatMe Gadgets
                               Will Leave

   The Will Leave gadget displays the amount of memory that
   EatMe will leave once it has taken memory.

   It is dependent on the @{"Amount to Eat" link AmtToEat} gadget, and the
   @{"Mem Type" link MemType} gadget.  In other words, if the Mem Type gadget
   is set for CHIP RAM, it will display the amount of CHIP
   RAM that will be available once you have selected the @{"Eat Memory" link EatMem}
   gadget.

   Keyboard Equivalent: 't'

   This gadget determines the type of RAM that EatMe will take.

   The currently available choices are:

     Any  - EatMe will take any type of RAM
     Chip - EatMe will only take Chip RAM
     Fast - EatMe will only take Fast RAM


   Note: The default selection can be specified using the option in the

                               Eat Memory

   Keyboard Equivalent: 'e'

   Once you have decided how much RAM you would like to eat, and
   once you have determined the type of RAM you want, press
   this button.  It will use your settings, and take the appropriate
   amount of RAM.

   Note: EatMe may not be able to take the exact amount specified.
         Because the memory is dynamic on the Amiga, some of the
         memory may have already been used by the time EatMe tries to
         allocate it. In addition, EatMe requires some memory in order
         to track the memory it allocates.  EatMe will try to allocate
         as close to the amount specified as possible.

   Eaten RAM may be returned by pressing the @{"Return Memory" link ReturnMem} gadget.

@node Menus "The EatMe Menus"

                       How to use the EatMe Menus

   There is only one menu available in EatMe.  That is the
   Project menu.

   Under the project menu you will find:

   Iconify (Amiga I):  Iconify will put EatMe into an AppIcon that sits
                       on the Workbench.  The image it uses is based upon
                       the EatMe icon.  If an icon is not available, it
                       will use the default tool icon.  To return
                       EatMe to its original state, double click on the
                       AppIcon.
                       Also see the @{"Tool Type" link ToolType} option, for
                       how to start EatMe in iconified mode.

   About:  Reveals important information about the version of EatMe
           you are using.

   Quit (Amiga Q):  Will quit EatMe.  If any memory is in use, EatMe will
                    return it before it exits.

@node ToolType "EatMe Options"

                             EatMe Options


    The following are the Tool Type options available to the user:

        X_POS= <number>   - x-coordinate for where the window should open at.

        Y_POS= <number>   - y-coordinate for where the window should open at.

        MEM_TYPE= <ANY> or <CHIP> or <FAST>   - default memory type.

        ICONIFY           - Make EatMe iconified at startup.



    Note: The above options must be specified exactly as shown, for them to
          work.


    Eg.1

        X_POS=100
        Y_POS=200
        MEM_TYPE=CHIP

            - This will open the EatMe window at coordinates (100,200) and
              will have the @{"Mem Type" link MemType} gadget displaying
              CHIP memory.


    Eg.2

        MEM_TYPE=FAST

            - This will open the EatMe window at the built-in default
              coordinates (the middle of your screen), and will have the
              @{"Mem Type" link MemType} gadget displaying FAST memory.


    Eg.3

        X_POS=100
        ICONIFY

            - This will start EatMe up as an AppIcon. When double-clicked on,
              the EatMe window at (100, middle of your screen).
