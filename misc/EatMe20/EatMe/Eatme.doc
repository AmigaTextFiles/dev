EatMe.Doc V2.0

Please have a look at the EatMe.guide file.  All the information
regarding EatMe is in there.

AmigaGuide is available on many FTP sites, and BBSes.  If you are
unable to find AmigaGuide, use your favorite text viewer to read
the file.  You will lose the hypertext abilities, but all of the
documentation is readable.
