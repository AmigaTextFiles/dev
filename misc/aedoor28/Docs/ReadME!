0. Why , Who, Where ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WHY: This archive was built from the original one, but I took over to the
development of the library, because after 2 years no bug fixes arrived.
so I decided to resource the library and hunt for the problems and then
release a (hopefully) fixed version.
WHO: I'm Rikki Ratboy/DhB
WHERE: you can contact me on the NightFall WHQ: hidden power, or you can
send me Email at this address rratboy@pobox.com


1. Who, what, when, where ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This archive contains a library that I once made to make it easier for
assembler programmers to code doors, but as with many of the things I
start on, I put this aside and started something else. But just recently
I restarted working on it, since it was a good base to make doors in E. So
I made an interface for E to use the library, and I think it's pretty
easy to use!
I also included the necessary files to use the library from assembler
(ofcourse, since this was WHY I wrote the lib in the first place :) and for
the SAS/C compiler V6.x (should also work on V5 or lower, I think)



2. Why the F*CK should I use it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well first of all, if you program in another language than C, you'll have to
write your own door interface, since there are only C Glue routines available.
Secondly, the library is VERY small (1-2Kb) so it doesn't eat up that much of
your precious memory.
But most of all... it is a SHARED library, meaning, you only need 1 copy to be
in memory for ALL your nodes and no door has to contain the door interface
routines anymore, so all your doors will be smaller, saving both disk and
memory space!
And, as a throw-in, if the door interface of amix were to change one of the
years, all you would need then, is a new library and ALL your doors would still
work!



3. Help for debugging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have included a little script program I use to debug my assembler doors,
all you need to do is to add the DEBUG.info to your ConfXCmd directory
(preferable a conference that nobody but you has access to, so that they
can't run the debug door...)
Now to use it issue these commands in your cli:

	1> setenv debug=<programname>
	1> setenv debugpath=<path>

For example to debug the EXAMPLE door in dir DOORS:Test/

	1> setenv debug=example
	1> setenv debugpath=DOORS:Test

		OR use this shortcut if you're in the directory that the door
		   is in:

	1> setenv debugpath=`cd`


Now if you issue the DEBUG command in conference X, ami express will start
the little script file called DOORS:Debugger, this file CD's to the door
directory and then starts MONAM <programname> <node>
(NOTE: be sure the S bit is set on the DOORS:Debugger script!!!!)





PS: The doordocs I included are from V2.20 of AmiX, since I didn't have a
    newer version of the file
