                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


        ------------------------[ V1.14 Docs ]--------------------

BUG FIXED IN V1.14!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This function didn't always work in version V1.13, this is now fixed!

NOTE: There might be some problems to use 2 doors together, if the first
      one messes up some of the internal /X variables... f.e. if you have
      2 doors installed in the FILECHECK and if they both change the
      DT_GOODFILE field of /X, then only the last value will be used by amix
      But if 1 of the 2 doesn't need this field then there is no problem at
      all (e.g. a duplicate checker and a SENT door together will work
      perfectly)


        ------------------------[ V1.13 Docs ]--------------------


As of V13, the AEDoor.library is able to run more than 1 door using the same
/X command. This is useful f.e. when you want to have more doors that use the
FILECHECK facility or any other /X built-in door command.
I came up with this idea after seeing BossNuke, which included SiGMA SEVEN's
duplicate filechecker. So I thought to myself, why not provide a way to do
this without having to get the source/linkable objects from the other coder.
And so, the Multi Door Support was born!


How to use Multi Doors?!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all let me add that this ONLY works with doors using the AEDoor lib!
So don't try to chain other doors together, cuz' it will NOT work!!!!

Let's take an example to show how to use this feature: Let's say you want to
use a duplicate checker and a general filecheck door together. Normally this
would cause problems since you can only use 1 FILECHECK door.
First of all we create a script file like this:

------CUT HERE------
.key node
.bra {
.ket }

MultiDoorStart {node}		;This creates the multi door environment
DOORS:DupeCheck {node}			;Put the desired doors here, don't
DOORS:FileChecker {node}		;forget the {node} parameter!!!!!
MultiDoorShutdown {node}	;This shut's down the multi door environment
------CUT HERE------

Now, set the Script bit on this file (PROTECT <filename> +S) and change the
LOCATION= tooltype in the FILECHECK icon to point to this script.
NOTE: The DOORTYPE *MUST* be XIM!! Don't use SIM or anything else!!!

And that's all there is to it! 


NOTE: you can have an unlimited amount of doors chained after eachother, as
      long as they use the AEDoor.library!
