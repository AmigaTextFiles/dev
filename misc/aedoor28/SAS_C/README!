This directory contains all the files you need to use the library with the
SAS/C V6.x compiler. If you encounter any problems then please let me know
since I'm no C guru, so there might still be some problems here and there,
altho everything SEEMS to work alright.

At the moment I've only written 1 example in C, but if need some more then
have a look at the E examples. The language is not that different, and I
think it will be understandable by a C programmer. Don't forget to read the
note below!


                             !!!!ATTENTION!!!!

I had to rename the HotKey() call to Hotkey() since that function was already
defined in the Commodities.
