Backbone Example Games
----------------------

There are four example games included here. The projects are also included
along with all graphics files needed. This way you can look at the example
programs and learn from them.

They are all very simple examples of what Backbone is capable of. I hope
in the future to get more professional and better looking examples ready.

Tutorial
--------
This game is used in the tutorial section of the menu to show what your
created project should look like. The game makes use of the powerhead
option in backbone to destroy blocks.

Monkey
------
This example shows a fairly fast moving platform game. Only basic baddies
are used but some of then (the tank) can fire back and some (the snail and
flying fish) will chase the player.
The player can also pick up a weapon in some levels.
Menus are used in more detail here. There is a menu screen to allow the
player to pick which level they start on.

Micro Fighters
--------------
This example is another fast moving platformer. This time the levels make
use of auto scrolling. This means the player has to keep moving right to
avoid being trapped by the moving screen.

Reality
-------
Apologies to the people who made reality. I made this example using the
graphics out of one of the example projects included in the Reality Game
Maker. It was just used to see how the two compare.
