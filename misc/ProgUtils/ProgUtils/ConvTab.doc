Preface
-------
  With this program you can convert the tabs in a file to spaces or to tabs
  of another size.
  The resulting file will always have the same layout as the source file.

  This program (ConvTab V2.1) is shareware.
  If you like and/or use this utility I would appreciate it very much
  if you'd send me a contribution of $10 US ($15 if you want to get a new
  update (when one is available)).
  Please send money by international money order, EuroCheck (in Belgian
  Francs (BF) !) or cash, because it's very difficult for me to cash in
  other checks.
  If you want an update please state your current version.
  If you want to use this program for commercial purposes please write
  for permission !

  If you have any suggestions or remarks you can write to (Bug reports are
  welcome too)

Syntax
------

  +---------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Commandline template:                                         |
  |   From/a,To/a,OLDTAB/a,NEWTAB,ANSI/s,NOSTR/s:                 |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Usage:                                                        |
  |   ConvTab <Source> <Dest> <OldTab> [<NewTab>] [ANSI] [NOSTR]  |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------+

    <Source>      : file to convert
    <Dest>        : converted file
    <OldTab>      : this is the original tab size
    <NewTab>      : specify a new tab size if you want all spaces and tabs
                    in the Source file to be converted to tabs of this
                    new size (if possible). If you don't specify a new tab
                    size, all tabs will be converted too spaces.
    <ANSI>        : normally tabs are converted in such manner, that the
                    layout of the file will look good if you 'type' it on
                    the standard CLI window. In other words, Ansi escape
                    codes are considered to be invisible.
                    But if you have an editor (like CED) which shows full
                    Ansi escape codes, you must specify this option if you
                    want the layout to look good. Of course the layout of this
                    resulting file will probably be faulty on the standard
                    CLI window (or with programs like PPMore and More).
    <NOSTR>       : when this option is given, ConvTab will make no conversion
                    in strings ("..." or '...'). This can be useful if you
                    want to convert sources.


  examples:

    ConvTab source.c dest.c 3
      Convert all tabs to spaces in the file 'source.c'.
      The file 'dest.c' will contain no tabs. The layout will be the
      same as in 'source.c' on the standard CLI window, and in some editors
      if 'source.c' contained no Ansi codes.

    ConvTab source.c dest.c 3 2 ansi
      Convert all tabs and spaces to new tabs (size 2).
      Ansi codes are not invisible.

    ConvTab source.c prt: 3 8
      Print 'source.c'. Whenever there is a tab (size 8) possible, it is
      generated.

    ConvTab source.c dest.c 3 3 nostr
      Convert all spaces in 'source.c' to tabs if possible. The tab size
      stays the same.
      Strings are not converted.

		Note that even if there are no tabs in a file, you must specify an
		old tab size. If this is the case, simply specify a dummy value.
