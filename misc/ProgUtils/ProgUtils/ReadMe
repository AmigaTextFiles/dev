You need arp.library for dm, WhatIs and ConvTab. If you don't have
arp.library already installed you must copy it to your libs: directory.

All the utilities in this subdirectory only work from CLI.
Read dm.doc, WhatIs.doc and ConvTab.doc for more information.
For the other utilities read the source.
