This documentation describes direct hardware use of the Sunrize AD516 card
without the need for the Studio16 software. It assumes a knowledge of
Motorola 680x0 assembly language and the Amiga system from a programming
viewpoint.

It is by no means complete, but it is enough to allow the programmer to
play and record sampled data directly through the AD516.

Included are three example sources. AD516pipe shows how to record audio
directly to PIPE:, AD516mpeg shows how to play mpeg audio files using the
AD516 card, and AD516meters shows how to read the peaks from the input
and display them in a bar graph. I use AD516pipe with Lame (PPC version) to
encode my vinyl records to mp3 files in near realtime. :-)
