AD516meters
(C) Copyright 2001 Chris Brenner

This was written to demonstrate a way of reading peak levels from the AD516,
and displaying them in a bar graph.

This program was written to be compiled with the SAS\C 6.58 assembler. It
requires the two non-standard include files:

hardware/ad516.i
offsets.i

The file offsets.i is simply a file that contains equates for all of the
Amiga library function offsets. A similar file can be found on Aminet
called LVOs.lha.
