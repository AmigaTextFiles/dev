AD516pipe
(C) Copyright 2001 Chris Brenner

This program sets the AD516 into record mode, and writes the sampled PCM
data out through PIPE:. It was written because I needed a way to directly
encode my vinyl records to mp3 files in one step. Since I couldn't find a
way to get the Studio16 software to write to PIPE:, I decided to explore a
way to directly access the AD516 card, and this software is the result.

AD516pipe works with Lame 3.26, but not with any of the more recent
versions since these try to seek on the input file. Being that Lame is
not fast enough to keep up with the data coming from the AD516, buffer space
is automatically allocated as needed, and will grow until the system is out
of memory. This works out fine. One side of a record, which is about twenty
minutes, causes the buffer space to grow to about 45 MB. This still leaves
about 70 MB of memory in my 128 MB system.

This program was written to be compiled with the SAS\C 6.58 assembler. It
requires the two non-standard include files:

hardware/ad516.i
offsets.i

The file offsets.i is simply a file that contains equates for all of the
Amiga library function offsets. A similar file can be found on Aminet
called LVOs.lha.
