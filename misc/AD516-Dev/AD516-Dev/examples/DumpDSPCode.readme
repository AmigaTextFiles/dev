DumpDSPCode
(C) Copyright 2001 Chris Brenner

This program will dump the DSP operating code from the AD516Handler to the
file RAM:DSPCode. It will only read from the AD516Handler that came with
version 3.01 of the Studio16 software.

This program was written to be compiled with the SAS\C 6.58 assembler. It
requires the two non-standard include files:

hardware/ad516.i
offsets.i

The file offsets.i is simply a file that contains equates for all of the
Amiga library function offsets. A similar file can be found on Aminet
called LVOs.lha.
