AD516mpeg
(C) Copyright 2001 Chris Brenner

This was written as a companion program to my AD516pipe program. It will
play an mpeg audio file directly through the AD516.

AD516mpeg uses the mpega library from Stéphane TAVENARD.

This program was written to be compiled with the SAS\C 6.58 assembler. It
requires the two non-standard include files:

hardware/ad516.i
offsets.i

The file offsets.i is simply a file that contains equates for all of the
Amiga library function offsets. A similar file can be found on Aminet
called LVOs.lha.
