@NODE Page_1 "Basic usage of Fusion"

Fusion allows the user to view 2 palettes, the Source and Destination.
A file, either an IFF ILBM (8 bitplanes or less) or IFF CMAP, can be
loaded into Source or Destination.
Up to 7 bitplanes of information will be used and displayed, and can
then be manipulated by the user.

1.  SELECTING CURSOR POSITION(S)

    The position of the 3 cursors (4, with "SPECIAL" window open) can
    be specified by using the left mouse button for the start of a
    range, and the right mouse button to mark the end of a range.



2.  COPYING A RANGE

    There are 2 cursors in the Source palette, which mark a start and
    end points of the range to be sent.  The cursor in the Destination
    palette marks the point where the range will sent to. The register
    numbers of these markers are displayed between the 2 palettes.

    Once the user has specified all three cursor positions, the range
    can be copied by pressing either: i.   "SEND RANGE" button
                                      ii.  Keyboard shortcut `E`
                                      iii. Middle mouse button

    The Destination palette will now contain the range of colours
    marked, at the required point.



3.  INCREASING OR REDUCING BITPLANES IN A PALETTE

    Load the palette concerned into the Destination palette.
    Open the "PREFS" window and alter the bitplane value to the
    desired amount.  Then Save the palette.



4.  VIEWING AND EDITING INDIVIDUAL PALETTE ENTRIES

    In the "MAIN" window, press the button marked "RGB VALUES", this
    will bring up a window showing the Red, Green & Blue values of
    the current register marked by the cursor in the Destination
    palette.  These values can be changed as required.



NOTE: All changes are performed on the Destination palette.
      The Source palette cannot, and will NOT be affected by any
      editing.

@ENDNODE


@NODE Page_2 "GUI functions and Keyboard shortcuts"

Fusion can be operated with only the 2 permanent windows open, "MAIN"
and "PALETTES" if the user wishes, but there are 3 other windows which
can be opened and positioned as required. These are:

1.

CONTROL    This window contains all the major functions for basic
           palette manipulation.

           LOAD (S)                ; Loads a palette into Source

           SEND RANGE              ; Sends the current range from
                                     Source to Destination

           SEND ALL                ; Sends entire Source palette to
                                     Destination

           UNDO                    ; Reverses the last change

           REDO                    ; Reverses the last undo

           LOAD (D)                ; Loads a palette into Destination

           SAVE                    ; Saves the Destination palette



2.

SPECIAL    This window contains functions which can apply effects to a
           specified range within the Destination palette. The Gadgets
           are labelled as follows:

           R,G,B,C,M,Y,K,W         ; Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta,
                                     Yellow, Black, White
                                     Tint(s) to be applied

           1X/2X/4X/8X/16X         ; Quantity of tint to be applied

           APPLY TINT              ; Apply tint to specified range

           R, G, B INPUT VALUES    ; Any value can be entered in these
                                     cells to specify a user defined
                                     tint

           APPLY CUSTOM            ; Apply user defined tint



3.

RGB VALUES This window displays the RGB values for the register
           specified by the cursor in the Destination palette.
           These values can be altered if required.



The positions of these 3 windows is saved along with the preferences
file, also whether they are open or not.  The display will be
constructed as saved whenever Fusion is loaded.
See @{" Preferences " LINK Page_4} for more details.



KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS. L   ; Load a Source palette

                    A   ; Save the Destination palette

                    E   ; Send Source range to Destination palette

                    U   ; Reverses the last edit on the Destination

                    R   ; Reverses the last undo

                    4   ; Restore GUI4 colour values (does not
                          protect them for future editing)

                    0   ; Toggle register zero between 3 colours
                          (bright, dark, original value)

@ENDNODE

@NODE Page_3 "Applying tints and user defined effects"

Bringing up the "SPECIAL" window, presents the user with various
options to apply a tint to the range specified in the Destination
palette.

An "end range" cursor appears in the Destination palette only when the
"SPECIAL" window is open - this additional cursor is not needed for
any other functions.  This cursor can be moved using the right mouse
button and is used to signify the end of the range to be affected.

1.  PRESET TINTS

The tint checkbox gadgets are as follows, and will specify a tint
using the associated colour(s).

R = Red        C = Cyan        K = Black
G = Green      M = Magenta     W = White
B = Blue       Y = Yellow

A tint of more than 1 colour can be applied simultaneously, but
certain ranges will not produce the desired effect.
(e.g. Cyan & Red will not change anything)

A quantity can be specified using the Cycle gagdet to the right of the
tint checkboxes. This quantiy will be used when the "APPLY TINT"
button is pressed.

NOTE: The unit of measure for this quantity is in AGA colour values.



2.  USER DEFINED EFFECTS

On the right of the "SPECIAL" window are gadgets relating to a user
defined tint process.  The 3 RGB boxes can contain any values which
will be added to the range of colours specified - minus figures will
reduce the values.  These values are applied to the range by pressing
"APPLY CUSTOM".



3.  CUTTING RANGES

Lastly, the "CUT RANGE" button will replace all registers in the
range with the user defined default colour as specified in Prefs.
This colour is also used across the entire palette upon startup.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Page_4 "Preferences and Tooltypes"

Preferences can be accessed by pressing the "PREFS" button in the
"MAIN" window.  Saved along with the Preferences file, is the position
of all the windows, and whether they are open.  The display is then
restored when Fusion is loaded.

GUI (registers 0-3) and mouse (registers 17-19) are copied from the
Workbench screen.

1.  PREFERENCES

    LOAD LOCATION...      The path where the user loads palettes from.

    SAVE LOCATION...      The path where the user saves palettes to.

    SCREEN MODE...        Any screen mode can be selected but it must be
                          greater or equal to than 640 x 256 pixels.

    FONT...               Font used for Fusion screen and windows.

    DEFAULT COLOUR        RGB values for initial colour of all registers
                          within a palette.  This colour is also used when
                          cutting a range from the Destination palette.

    BITPLANES             Depth of palette to be worked on. (NOT depth of
                          Fusion screen.)

    PROTECT GUI4          With this ticked, registers 0-3 will NOT be
                          affected by any editing or copying - thus
                          preserving the Intuition GUI colours.

    PROTECT MOUSE         With this ticked, registers 17-19 will NOT be
                          affected by any editing or copying. This will
                          keep the mouse colours the same as Workbench.



Fusion also contains 4 TOOLTYPE values which can be altered.
These are not neccesary for the functioning of Fusion and all have
default values if these are found to be absent.

2.  TOOLTYPES

    NOABOUT=    ; Value 0 - The Fusion "About" requester will be displayed
                  on startup and is available to view at any time.

                ; Value 1 - Fusion will immediately display the GUI, and
                  will not load the "About" imagery, thus saving memory,
                  and time if loading from floppy.


    WRAP=       ; Value 0 - Any tinting will put a limit on RGB values at
                  0 and 255, these values will not be exceeded.

                  Value 1 - If a colour index value exceeds 255 it will
                  return to 0, and vice versa.


    SLOWSEND=   ; Value 0 - Range will be sent from Source to Destination
                  immediately (in 1 frame).

                  Value 1 - Range will be sent from Source to Destination
                  with a 1 frame delay between each register.


    TOL=        ; Value between 0 and 255 - When the user positions the
                  cursor over a colour within either palette, this value
                  is used to determine whether to display a cursor using
                  colour 1 or 2 (generally black or white).

@NODE Page_5 "Requirements"

The requirements for running Fusion, are:

1.  AGA graphics chipset (or a display capable of 8 bitplanes).

2.  OS3.0 or higher.

3.  Approximately 200K free memory.

4.  For hard disk installation: Around 220K of free space.



Technical info for using Fusion:

1.  Due to the nature of the Amiga's display, Fusion does not display
    any palettes with 8 bitplanes, only the first 128 colours of such
    an object (either IFF ILBM or IFF CMAP) will be used.
    Fusion8 (in Fusion8V1_0 folder) should be used for 8 bitplane
    palettes.

2.  To install Fusion to a hard disk, copy Fusion executable and the
    directory "Data" (i.e. the entire FusionV1_0 folder) to any area on
    your HD.  Fusion does not need any special fonts, assigns or libraries
    to run.

3.  If the intension to have the "NOABOUT" tooltype set to 1, you may
    delete the following files to save disk space;

    /FusionV1_0/Data/FusionData1
    /FusionV1_0/Data/FusionData2

4.  Fusion always uses an 8 bitplane screen for it's display, regardless
    of the depth of palette being worked on.

5.  Fusion has NOT been tested on any 24 bit graphics cards.
