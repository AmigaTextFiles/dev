@node introduction "Introduction"
Introduction

This is a MapEditor for making graphics for games and programs.

Why did I make this?
Because I was not happy with the current mapeditors available
MapEdit being about the best I decided to write my own. Some
of the things I wanted for editing were not having the blocks
covering the display, quicker pasting, more options for size
of the blocks ect.

What is a map editor?
Its a program that allows you to edit a screen by pasting down little blocks
with the mouse and allowing you to save the decription of the screen as a
map file. Therefore saving you alot of work writing down hundreds
of numbers. 

Why use a map editor?
The answer is simple instead of having many
30K to 40K pictures as the backgrounds for your game why not build
it up of blocks stored in a single picture and just use a simple map
file to tell your game where to paste the blocks for each screen.

This program is freeware.
If you are a shareware author
email me a keyfile for your program as payment. :-).

@node requirements "Requirements"
Requirements

You will need an Amiga computer with about 1MB of Ram.
I guess thats all you need but a harddrive is
fairly essential.

@endnode

@node installation "Installation"
Installation

Just drop the drawer anywhere you like it.
Easy eh?

Also make sure you pick someblocks before you start (loadblocks)
and then hit saveprefs. This sets which blocks to load on startup
and the paths to the blocks will be differnt on your machine if
you do not do this.(Resulting in a file not found message)

@node usage "Usage"
Usage

This is a description of all of the functions that this program
has. It also tells you how to use this MapEditor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Setting your Prefs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
When you start the program the first active menu will appear after
you click by the info screen. On this screen there are a number
of gadgets that let you set up the type of map you wish to edit.
Here is a rundown of the various gadgets.

The first two gadgets allow you to define your working screen

# of Colors- This allows you to choose how many colors your map
             shall use. You can pick from 2 to 32 colors. To edit
             a AGA map you must cut down your blocks to 32 colors
             Edit and save a map as usual and then use the higher
             color blocks in your own program.

Resolution- This allows you to edit a map in hires or LoRes.

The next two allow you to define the size of your map not the
size of your blocks.

# of Horiz Blocks- This is how many blocks you wish to have in
                   the horizontal directions or from Left to Right.

# of Vert Blocks - This is how many blocks you wish to have in the
                   Vertical directions or Up and Down.

The next three gadgets define the way in which your blocks
will be cut out and what size they will be.

Width of blocks- This allows you to set the width of your blocks
                 in pixels. 16 is a common size but it may be as
                 large or small as you like within reason.

Height of blocks- This allows you to set the Height of your blocks
                  16 is a common size but it may be as small or
                  large as you like within reason.

Block Gap       - This is if there are spaces between your blocks in the
                  original IFF file. For example if you have your blocks 
                  drawn like this
                     [] [] [] [] []
                  there would be a block gap of 1 because of the 1 space
                  border between each square.
                     []  []  []  []  []
                  This would have a block gap of 2 because of the 2
                  spaces between each square.

I recommend when saving a Iff picture of your blocks to name it
with its dimensions. For example if your blocks are 16X16 and have
a block gap of 1 call it Blocks.16x16x1 so you know what to enter into
the program.

The next gadgets are for loading and saving things.

Load Blocks- This will pop up a requestor and allow you to choose
             a iff file containing the blocks you would like to
             use in your map. Hit getdir if your files do not appear
             in the requestor.

LoadPrefs-   This is not needed at the moment but it will load your
             Previously saved prefs.

SavePrefs-   Saves the currently entered values as the defaults.


The Go button actually starts the process of editing your map using
the settings you have picked

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Editing Your Map.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have pushed the go button you can begin to edit your map.
The left mouse button will paste down the currently selected block
onto the screen. The Arrow keys or Joystick allow you to move your
map around the screen.

The Right mouse button brings up your selection screen. From here
you can choose a new block and perform other various actions as
follows.

The Left mouse button will select a new block for editing.
To scroll further down your blocks use the Up Down arrow keys
or the Joystick.

New - This allows you to start a new map and will bring you back
      to the starting screen to enter new values.

ClearAll - This will fill your entire map with the currently
           selected block. Its good to do this when you first
           start your map to lay down the background.

Random -  Creates a random map. Doesn't work well yet.

LoadMap - Lets you choose a premade map from a file Requestor.
          Press GetDir if your files do not appear.

SaveMap - Lets you save your map using a fileRequestor.
          I suggest saving your maps with a .map extension.

LoadBlocks- Lets you load in a differnt set of blocks.

Reprint -   Redraws the Display if it gets messed up.
            Usually not needed.

SavePreview- Lets you save a preview of the currently shown
             portion of the map you are editng as a iff.

SaveBlocks- Lets you save the current block set as a iff.

Quit-       Quits the program.

SaveIcons- This saves a AmosPro Icon bank to be loaded into
           your Amos programs for if you would rather use the
           icon bank than use a block cutting routine.

GrabArea- This allows you to grab a area of blocks to paste.
          Click on the upper left corner and then the lower right
          corner of the section you want to cut, then paste as
          usual. Picking a new block will get rid of the cut
          piece.

The other things on this screen do not function yet.

@node blocks "The Block Format"

The Block Format

The blocks you use to build up your map must be rectangular
shaped and all the same width and height. They can be in a 2
to 32 color Iff file in the standard screen dimensions of
320x200 for Lores use or 640x200 for Hires use. They must
be evenly spaced and put from left to right as far as they will
fit evenly. Look at the example blocks included. There may
be a gap in between each block as long as it is even all
around them. They do not have to fill the whole page but
must go from left to right as far as possible without
cutting them off on the right side.

The blocks will be cut from left to right and the first
block on the left will be block 1 and each block after
that will go up by 1. Eg. 1  2  3  4  5  6
                          7  8  9  10 11 12
                          13 14 15 16 17 18

@endnode

@node map "The Map Format"
The Map Format

The map format used by MapMaster is very simple. Its a plain
Text file that has a listing of all blocks used in your map
by there number. Each listing is moved down 1 line by hitting
the newline key (return) this is done to seperate the numbers
and make them easy to read with any programming language.
Your program must handle getting the blocks and pasting
them down in the correct places this is fairly easy
to set up in a loop. There is some example code for AmosPro
in the Amos drawer for doing this. I am still working on
C versions of the example code. If you know what would
be the best way to do this in C then E-Mail me.
Its best to store the map data in an array of some kind.
In Amos- Dim map(width*Height)
In C-    char map[width*Height];

Example.

w= block 1
o= block 2

wwwwwwwwww
wwooooooww
woooooooow
woooooooow
wwooooooww
wwwwwwwwww

if this is your map and you save it this is
the way the save file would look. If you
would like another save format with more
info or stored differently E-Mail and I'll
see what I can do.

@node c "C support"
C Support

Look in the C support drawer for full C language
support files and a simple example.

@endnode

@node amos "Amos Support"
AmosSupport

There is some source code in the AmosCode drawer in this
archive that can help you to load in the maps cut the
blocks from a iff picture and paste them to the screen.
Just include them in your own programs for easy use of
the map files. You may change the code as you see fit
but my name must be in the credits if you use the
code.

@endnode

@node bugs "Bugs"
Bugs

I think there might be a few little bugs yet but its pretty
good. E-Mail me if you have problems and I will try to fix it.

Email- samel@telusplanet.net

It does not support AGA but you can just cut down the colors
of your blocks and then save them as a temporary file. Then the maps
you produce can still be used on your AGA program even if it doesn't
look quite right in the editor.

@endnode

@node future "Future"
Future

If you have any ideas/Suggestions for future versions of this
program E-Mail them to me and I will try to implement them.

I would like to support AGA but this is very difficult in AmosPro
maybe I will recode it in C someday. If you know how to do AGA
in AmosPro mail me.

Hi my name is Kelly Samel and I have been using the amiga for 
almost 3 years now and will be continuing to use it for many
years to come. I like to do Raytracing in Imagine programming
in AmosPro and now C as well as play games and various other 
things like painting going on the net ect.

Feel free to e-mail me and tell me if you like this program.
Or if you have any docs or knowledge that would help a new guy get better
at programming in C, mail me as well.
