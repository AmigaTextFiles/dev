P2LATEX is built on the work of others and makes liberal use of code
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation and others. Thus, it is by
default subject to the GPL. Please refer to the file LICENSE for
details.

Even though p2latex was written on a machine running AmigaDOS, it is
fundamentally a Unix (or GNU :-) command. Its quite portable, though.

I have supplied Makefiles for Unix and AmigaDOS. The one for AmigaDOS
is for SAS/C v5.10b. Yes, I now that compiler is a bit outdated, but
it happens to be the one I have.

If you don't have flex, touch p2latex.c before you invoke make.

If you use Amiga gcc, you can build p2latex with the supplied Unix
Makefile if you have versions of Unix rm, mv, and BSD make installed.
They are shipped with newer versions of gcc; they are also available
on Aminet. While you're at it, make or get Amiga ports of all the Unix
commands you can lay your hands on. I did a port of the f2c Fortran to
C translator without changing the Makefile that way.
