In this distribution, I included the scanned library vcb.lib
for use with the Manx/Aztec Linker and the makefile to re-
produce it.

My development system is Aztec 5.2a.

Since the amiga.lib support functions like DoMethod() etc.
do not seem to be present in Manx's standard library c.lib,
I re-coded them in module domethod.c (at least they do the same
thing as the originals. I did not use any Commodore Amiga sources,
only their AutoDocs).

People who link with amiga.lib should leave out the domethod module
(and probably the callhook module, too).
