The   very   first   Version   of   TXADocReader   was   a   simple  Programm
to show Autodocs.    We  thought  "Hell,  that  can't  be  all"  and  started
sniffing around  in other  so called Autodocreaders.  But noone of them could
satisfy our needs and so we started improving our own AutoDocReader.  Most of
the other Software  was  not  easy to use and didn't have all the Features we
wanted to have.

We   wanted   to   have   functions   who   are   able   to   handle   things
like Include, Structures  and  LVO handling.  Therefor we worked hard and now
we  are proud  of what we did.  The TXAdocReader does what he is supposed to.
To handle Autodocs and show their Data in an external Viewer.

After   the   first   publication   of   the   Reader   on  Aminet,  tons  of
E-Mails reached us,   telling   us   some  new  Ideas  and  Bugreports.   But
unfortunally  the People seem  not  to be interested in Free registering this
Programm.

We   need   the   registering  because  we  want  to  know  how  much  People
are really using the TXADocReader.  We need this Informations because we want
to know,  if it  makes  sense  to  concentrate  on  this  Project  and update
the ADocReader regulary.   it  doesn't  make  sense  to  do  hard  Work  on a
Programm that noone uses.  So *REGISTER FOR FREE* and help us developing good
Software.

We   tried   to   respect  all  your  Ideas  and  Bugreports.   We  hope  you
like the result  of  our  hard work.  And don't forget....  REGISTER FOR FREE
*NOW*

             From this version forward we´ll deliver keyfiles :)

The Program is still free and ofcourse the unregistered version ist still not
limited. All funktions are full available.

Step 1:

Use TXADRREGISTRATOR and follow carefully and exactly the instructions.
It is very important to keep the Subject ADREG. Also do not make any changes
to the generated mail, because the mailparser and the serializer would get
wrong informations to complete their operations successfully.

Step 2:

Submit the mail, generated by the Registrator to saxon@wizard.art-line.de
with the subject ADREG .

Step 3:

Routing dependent a confirmation will reach You after 1-6 days.
The UU encoded keyfile will follow. This personal key has to be decoded and
moved to the PROGDIR: of the program.
