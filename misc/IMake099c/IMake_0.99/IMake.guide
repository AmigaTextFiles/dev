@node Introduction

    IMake was designed to avoid the shell for programmers who don't
    like languages which only has commandline compiling and linking,
    (including me).

    IMake is easy to use and configure via a user-friendly GUI with
    buttons and menus for ease of use. My aim is to make IMake as
    intuitive as possible, but for that I also need your help with
    suggestions and bug-reports, as this only is a beta-version for
    testing.
    Please have a look at the @{"bugs" link Bugs} part of this documentation
    before you start because there are a few (not so harmful) bugs
    included, just for your satisfaction :-).
    To contact me, @{" Click here " link Author}

@endnode

@node Requirements

    Workbench:          3.0
    Extra libraries:    Reqtools.library 38 or greater.

    Reqtools.library by Nico François is freely distributable so it
    is included with IMake.

    IMake has only been tested on Amiga 1200HD with Workbench 3.0 so
    I don't know about compatibility wit other systems.
    Let me know if it works (or doesn't work) on your computer-system.

    A programming language is preferred :-), preferably a commandline-
    compiler (AMOS wont do). It is optional to link the objectcode
    generated. But more on that in the @{"usage" link Usage} section.
    SAS/C v6.50 works perfectly fine and AmigaE too. A68k assembler
    didn't work so well (but I didn't got it working in shell either).

@endnode

@node Configuration

    Configuration is made with the menu "Preferences".
    The first thing to do is to get things straighted out with your
    compiler. What you should know is:

1   ·Where is the directory containing the compiler, assembler, linker
    and so on?
    For SAS/C 6.50 it is "sc:c" for example. If you are working
    with AmigaE it should be "AmigaE:bin". This is configured in the
    menuchoice "Workdir..." Read part 6 for more information on Workdir.

2   ·What is the name of your compiler?
    For example "sc" with SAS/C, and "ec" with AmigaE.
    Menuchoice: "Compiler..."

3   ·The path to the editor you want to use.
    Menuchoice: "Editor..."

4   ·Options for the compiler.
    If you have SAS/C 6.50 maybe you would like "link" here and the compiler
    will link your project automatically with no need to specify "Link after
    compiling".
    It is dependent of your compiler so look in your compiler-documentation.
    Menuchoice: "Options..."

5   ·If you want another program to take care of linking, the menuchoice
    "Link after compiling" should be active and the name of the linker under
    "Linker...".
    Options can also be given to the linker with "Linker options..."
    NOTE! that this funktion is not very useful for the moment as it is
    not entirely developed yet.

6   ·If your compiler needs some assigns, you could put them in a script-
    file and enter its name in the STARTSCRIPT tooltype. The script-file
    will then be executed when you start IMake.
    Note! If your compiler needs paths, ex. a command like 'path sc:c add',
    you cannot put them in this start-file as IMake is a workbench-program
    and don't care about this command.
    Instead you should write this path in the menuchoice "Workdir..." as
    specified before.

7   The other menuchoices are:

    ·File req path; the directory where the filerequester shall start
    looking for files when you start the program.

    ·User gadget and User command; There is a button named "User" in
    the downer left corner of the main window. You can choose a CLI-
    command that will be executed when this button is clicked, and also
    the label of the button.

    ·Run arguments; If your project is a CLI-program it might want some
    arguments. This is where you insert them. (This string is not saved
    in the configuration file.)

    ·Output window; If you want the output-window to look different, or
    if you want the output to go to a file, then type the window description/
    filename here.

    That's all you need to know about configuring for programming.
    The rest of the tooltypes are described on the page @{"tooltypes" link Tooltypes}.

@node Usage

    To use IMake is simple, as long as you have @{"configured" link Configuration} correct.

    First when IMake is started you should choose a project.
    Click the small gadget marked with nothing and a file-requester pops up.
    Choose an existing project (sourcecode) or write a new name. You may
    also use the appwindow function and drag an icon onto IMakes window.

    Now press the edit gadget if you need to edit the sourcecode, or the
    compile gadget if you want to compile it.
    An output window is opened (dependant on how you have configured) and
    you will hopefully get some information of the compilation progress.

    If the compilation was successful, you could try to run your newly
    created program. Just click the Run gadget.
    Note! you must use a name with a dot (.) and then an extension for
    the sourcecode or else the run function is not going to work.
    If you want to give your program some arguments, then choose the
    menuchoice "Run arguments...", type them in and press OK.

    That's it. It IS so easy (I hope).
    So get started with the programming NOW!

@endnode

@node Tooltypes

The IMake Tooltypes

    PATH=        The directory where the file-requester shall look first.
    PATTERN=     The pattern in file-requester.
    WINLEFT=     Where the program window should be placed from the left
                 edge of the screen.
    WINTOP=      Same, but from the top of screen.
    STARTSCRIPT= If you want IMake to look for a script file and execute
                 it on start-up.

@endnode

@node Bugs

    There are not many known bugs in this version as it has been carefully
    tested, but one of them is the memory-loss of exactly 56 bytes when
    IMake has run.
    Does anyone know what that depends on?

    I cannot get IMake to access the paths made by the CLI-command path.
    Because some compilers need that kind of paths, I have included the
    menuchoice "Workdir..." as a temporarily substitute, but if a compiler
    needs more than one path, it doesn't work so well.
    I know that a Workbench-program doesn't work the same way as those
    started from shell and wont get the paths made from shell.
    If someone knows if I could use these paths from a Workbench-program,
    PLEASE!!! contact the @{"Author" link Author}

    Another thing with Workdir. You can choose Workdir from inside of
    IMake, and save the configuration. Then the new Workdir is used
    when you start IMake next time. I.e. it's not used directly, so you
    have to quit IMake and then start again.

    Don't care about the returncodes given by IMake when a compilation
    or linking fails and/or terminates. They are only included because
    I thought I could do anything about it later.
    Actually they exists to annoy the user who would like to know what
    went wrong. :-)

    The menus are not localizated because I cannot build menus so well
    yet. I might learn in the future (I will, it's just a matter of time),
    and your menus will soon speak to you in your own language.

    The menuchoice "User gadget..." has currently no function. You could
    choose it as many times as you want but nothing happens. It'll be
    fixed with a later release I think.

    When Reqtools.library is not availiable in the libs: directory, IMake
    will open and close a window very quickly so that you are not able
    to read what it says. It says that IMake can't find reqtools.library,
    just in case you were wondering. The reason why is because I hadn't
    time to do something fancy.
    (Before a reqtools-requester was supposed to be opened to tell that
    reqtools wasn't availiable. As it doesn't make to much sense to use
    a library that is not opened nor availiable, the computer crashed and
    I threw in a simple output to a con: window.)

@node Author


    This is my second beta release of IMake. It is distributed as a test
    version for YOU to use and test out, then send me suggestions for
    the GUI (which I have worked very hard with), the functions or
    things I have forgotten. Bugreports are always welcome too. :-)
    If you have made a catalog file for a different language, you will
    also gain grateful thoughts from me.

    AND!!!, you will get the first finished version of IMake (whenever it
    is ready), and all updates if you want, without any other sacrifices
    than a disk (maybe with something on it PD-progs, pics, mods etc),
    some money for the postage and your address.

    IMake is not shareware, you'll have to pay because I must send letters
    and that costs money. But soon I'll obtain an i-net address where you
    can reach me and i'll be able to send the package by e-mail (for free).
    If you use internet, include your address and I might contact you that
    way in the future.


    NOTE!
    IMake 0.99 (beta) is freeware. It may be copied and spread as long as
    no charge is taken. If you include IMake in a program collection or
    such, like on a coverdisk for a magazine or a CD-rom collection, you
    should get my permission first.

    Disclaimer:
    Although IMake has been tested carefully, I cannot take any responsibility
    if your system may be damaged by IMake or any of the programs/files
    included in the IMake package!
    I.E. You use this program on your own risk.
    I will neither take any responsibility if anyone gets annoyed by my
    use of the english language. So you read this documentation entirely
    on your own risk!

    Thanx to:
    Nico François for making the excellent reqtools.library, used by IMake
    for requesters, and for making a lot of other useful programs.
    Rafael D'Halleweyn for Catedit which was used to make the Swedish
    catalog-file.
    Everyone that finds this program useful (and everyone else who uses the
    best computer (Amiga in case you didn't know :-) ).
