There are some changes to the documentation.

This is IMake version 0.99c. Some adjustments have been made,
mainly memory-hunting and optimizing, but this is the big
improvement:


·The menuchoice "Link after compiling" is now functioning.
When you enter the linkoptions; enter {f} in the place where
the name of the file shall be.
Confused? Me too!

An example: When you are going to link the usual way, i.e. from
the shell, you might write like this:

1.> slink FROM c.o myproject.o LIB lib:sc.lib lib:amiga.lib
(If you use SAS/C wit slink)

Then start IMake, choose the "Linker" menuchoice and enter the
name of your linker (slink).
Then you choose the "Linker options" menuchoice and
enter this:
FROM c.o {f} LIB lib:sc.lib lib:amiga.lib
In the place of {f}, IMake puts the name of your project.


Thats it (I think). Happy programming.
