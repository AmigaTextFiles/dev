@node intro "Introduction"

Hi.  These are the docs for ReCop.  Basically, I wrote ReCop when I felt I
needed something to hack up other people's copper code when I was trying to
learn about low level display hacks etc., ok, I WANTED TO WRITE A SMALL
INTRO, we've all done it, nothing to be embarrassed about ;-)

I'm releasing this because

a) I found it useful
b) You might find it useful
c) I'm broke and some shareware donations would be nice :(

Please, have some sympathy for a poor student.  I don't go to University
'til October and I'd rather sit here at home and write gorgeous Amiga
software packages which will blow your mind, rather than get a day job...
however if you'd rather I got a boring job (unskilled labour type thing)
then that's OK, I understand.  Sniff sniff.  :)

Recommended shareware @{"donation" link contact} is 5.00 (UKP).

OK.  ReCop performs a similar role to ReSource (tm) except this one
disassembles copper lists.  It can disassemble one at any address in
memory, or it can disassemble one from a file, or you can point it at a
View structure and let it grind away, or you can use PIPES!

That's right.  You can just @{"pipe" link usage} data into it, and get a disassembly out at
the other end, which you pipe elsewhere...  e.g.  text formatter,
assembler, you name it ;-)

This disassembly, however, uses the proper C= symbol names. You can have
the original hex alongside the disassembly. You can also turn the Hardware
Reference Manual style comments on or off.

Reassembling the copperlist is a simple process.  Just run the resultant
source file through your favourite assembler, and make sure the provided
macros are in your include path (as well as the C= hardware includes), and
all will be well.  Tested with PhxAss 4.14, DevPac 2.15 and SNMA 1.955.

Make sure you're in object module mode though, unless you're including the
sourcefile yourself in another module. Enjoy!

@node usage "Usage"

Knock yourself out. ReCop uses a standard ReadArgs style command template,
and not some lame Un*x crud. Here's the template:

F=FILE,A=ADDRESS/K,V=VIEW/K,L=LENGTH/K/N,TO/K,H=HEX/S,
NC=NOCOMMENT/S,SYS/S,PIPE/S

FILE        This is the name of the file containing the copperlist you wish
            to disassemble.  Just a straightforward binary file.  No Exe's
            or anything fancy like that.  If you want support for that kind
            of thing, send @{"mail" link contact"} to @{"me" link aboutme}, better still, @{"send me some cash" link contact"} ;-)

            At the moment, it stops when it gets to a CEND
            (i.e. a $FFFF,$FFFE). I'll put LENGTH in @{"later" link todo} for this.

ADDRESS     This is the address of a copperlist in memory that you wish to
            disassemble.  An address of 0 is ignored completely.  The
            address you give will be rounded to the nearest word offset, so
            no naughty odd address errors I'm afraid. If you don't specify
            a length using the LENGTH keyword, then the routine stops when
            it gets to a CEND.

VIEW        This is the address of a struct View that you wish to disassemble
            the copperlists of.  If interlace is enabled, then the short
            frame copperlist gets disassembled too.

LENGTH      This is the decimal number of copperlist instructions in the
            copperlist that you've passed using the ADDRESS keyword.

TO          This is the filename the disassembly is to be output to. If you
            don't specify a filename then it all goes to the output stream,
            whatever you've got that set up to be.  You can't pipe it if
            you use this keyword.

            Not yet enabled.

HEX         Show the raw hex alongside the commented disassembly.

NOCOMMENT   Don't print comments about registers.

SYS         Disassemble the currently running graphics.library copperlists.
            This makes a private copy first, and arbitrates using
            Disable()/Enable(), so dragging the screen won't crash it ;)

PIPE        If you don't specify any arguments then ReCop assumes you're
            being a total berk and shouts 'required argument missing'.
            This was so that if somebody was running the command and didn't
            know what it was, instead of getting a load of baloney from
            ReCop treating the console input as a copperlist to be
            disassembled, you had a chance to think about it :)

            Specify PIPE and it'll treat stdin as a copperlist.

@endnode
@node bugs "Bugs"

Bugs in *MY* code? Never. ;)

@endnode
@node todo "To Do"

Make ReCop pure and reentrant.
Make ReCop a shared library.
Make ReCop arbitrate (using Disable()/Enable()) for access to the memory
block (ADDRESS) or the struct View (VIEW).

Make FILE option obey LENGTH keyword.

@node aboutme "About the author"

 Amiga advocate and C programmer

 Computing Science student (in a few months' time :)

 Pratchett fan (Ook?)

 Babylon 5 and X-Files fan

 U2 / Oasis / Elastica fan

 Author's favorite songs of above artists:

  @{b}Even Better Than The Real Thing
  The Fly
  Acquiesce
  Supersonic
  Connection
  Line Up @{ub}

 Violently opposed to inadequately expressive forms of music which
  required little talent to implement.  (i.e.  thinks Whigfield sucks big
  time)

 Needs a job

 Enjoys Mini Kievs and thinks there should be more of such vending machines

 Is a devotee of Fidonet Region 25's AMIGA_PROG echo

 Usually ends up recieving flames from occupants of above echo ;)

 Has an annoying habit of writing documentation such that all references
  to the author are in the third person ;-)

OK, OK, I'll stop! ;)

The recommended shareware donation for ReCop is 5 (Pounds Sterling).  Only
cheques drawn on a British bank only, or EuroCheques (in Sterling), or US
Dollars will be accepted as payment.  Please support the shareware concept.
Sending me cash for this will be treated as acknowledgement that you want
to see 'cool stuff' like octamed.datatype, mimemail.object and
macbinary.datatype in future. It'll also be an incentive. ;)

I'm also available for commercial projects, if you want to give me a job! ;)
