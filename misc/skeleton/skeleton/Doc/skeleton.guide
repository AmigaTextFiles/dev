@{i}Note:  Browsing this AmigaGuide document will work well.@{ui}

When you start working on a new programming project, there are a lot of
things to set up:  compiler flags, makefile layout, revision control et
cetera.  Documentation, installation script and icons are needed if you
plan to release it as well.

This archive contains a skeleton or template for such a project, removing
many of the trivial decisions from the programmer, and hopefully allowing
her to concentrate on design, writing and programming.

Skeleton is freeware, but it is also copyrighted by me.  You may use and/or
change it for any purpose, and distribute your changed versions, as long as
you give me credit for exactly my part of the work.  Of course, I have no
claims on the things YOU create with the help of this utility.

I take no responsibility for the use or misuse of this software.

@NODE Requirements

@{b}Requirements@{ub}

The requirements on hardware is practically zero.
Requirements on software, however:

· V39 datatypes are needed to read this document
  properly

· V37 is needed for some constructions in the Makefile

· the C part of Skeleton is written with SAS/C 6.55 and
  ANSI C in mind.

· some revision control software (like HWGRCS) is assumed
  (optional, but a great tool).

· the default SCOPTIONS file assumes you have set up SAS/C
  to send error messages to SCMSG. Either use SE or some other
  editor with a SAS/C interface.

@NODE Installation

@{b}Installation@{ub}

No installation is really needed.

Perhaps I should enter tutorial mode here again.  Giving installation
instructions and possibly installation scripts is hard.

· If you use Installer scripts, try to make the script as non-non-standard as
  possible.  Use the internal file copyer (with progress indicator) instead
  of spawning C:Copy.  And so on.  I haven't used Installer; otherwise I
  would have provided an example script here.

· A Shell or Rexx script can be almost as good as an Installer script.  Don't
  forget the icon.

· Try VERY HARD to avoid modifying the startup-sequence with assigns and
  other unnecessary garbage.  Many people will discard software which needs
  assigns.

· Keep in mind that many people try to keep third-party software away from
  their system partition, and may have multiple-assigned things like LIBS:
  to two or more places, SYS:Libs and one for non-Commodore libraries.

· An uninstall script would also be nice.

· Whatever you supply as an installation script, always state in the
  documentation what the installation will look like.

@NODE Usage

@{b}Usage@{ub}

If you plan to use this archive as a template for your new projects, browse
all files first to see if there is something you always will want
differently (icon colors, compiler options, whatever).

Keep the files somewhere and copy them to wherever you want to start a new
project.  Then be sure you go through each file and supply your own data
where I've supplied example data.  For example, this whole AmigaGuide file
is an example and needs some major editing before you can ship it with your
own program ;-)

@NODE RevCo

@{b}Revision control@{ub}

Revision control with RCS or some other system is a good thing when writing
things that you will change frequently.  Like C source code, or
documentation, or pictures, or just about anything.  There is one command
to save ("check in") the file into a database, and another to retrieve
versions from the database.  Any older version can be retrieved, as only
changes from the previous version are stored.  On top of this, you can get
a version number and a change log into your text.

What I do is I check in ('make archive') all source files each time I feel
I have done some important changes, and then recompile them all ('make') if
this is the final change before distributing.

Important:  if you have a file up in your editor when you check it in, be
sure to reload it.  Otherwise, you will lose the log entry.  Ideally, an
editor should complain if the underlying file changes, but I've seen no
editor that does this.

@NODE AmigaGuide

@{b}Good AmigaGuide style@{ub}

Writing good hypertext is hard.  There should probably be an AmigaGuide
style guide.  Here are some of my thoughts on the subject:

· Keep the document simple.  An AmigaGuide document is mathematically a
  graph, and it's very easy to get lost in a graph, even easier than getting
  lost in a directory tree.  Use as few levels as possible.

· Make it possible to read the whole document lineary in a logical way, using
  the 'Browse' buttons.

· There are three types of links ("buttons") in your text:
  a) table-of-contents type of lists,
  b) click-on-a-word-in-the-text type of references inside
     running text,
  c) 'see also' type of references at the bottom of the page.

  In my opinion, a) in combination with c) is best.  b) tends to generate
  spaghetti-hypertext where you soon get lost and spend all your time
  retracing, fearing you've lost something important.  Also, links on every
  instance of the word 'author' or 'MUI' or whatever look silly.

· NEVER keep an important node accessible only through a button in running
  text.  Everything important should be accessible through 'Contents'-type
  lists.

· Keep the introduction on the first page of the document, so that it is
  instantly visible.

· Supply multi-level 'Contents' links where appropriate.  By simply using
  'Retrace', it can be tedious to reach a previous page

· Never misuse AmigaGuide and create gadget-like links with the text beside
  the 'button'.

· Never hardcode fonts in your document, unless you always can control which
  screen it will be shown on.

· It can be a good idea to keep a long, continous text in multiple short
  nodes instead of one long scrolling, provided you know the pages won't be
  too long on some systems.  'Browse' can be simpler for the user than
  scrolling.

· At other times it may be appropriate to keep several different short
  subjects on one page.  Concistency rules.

· Never use long lines and v39 AmigaGuide word wrap.

· Authoring your documentation in texinfo (comes with GNU C, I think) and
  converting to AmigaGuide may be an option.  In that case, you get that
  bothersome formatting for free.
@ENDNODE


@NODE Icons

@{b}Icons@{ub}

Icons constitute a major problem with many distributions.

· Firstly, they are a problem if they don't exist, and a Workbench-only user
  gets hold of the archive.  Don't forget to supply an icon for the main
  directory as well!

· Then there's the default tool.  AVOID GIVING ABSOLUTE PATHS.  Avoid
  non-standard utilities, such as MuchMore.  MultiView doesn't exist before
  v39, and that's a problem.

· The icon graphics:  4-color Commodore-style, 8-color, HighRes, LowRes,
  MagicWB-style, NewIcon...  it's a mess.  You can provide several of these
  and let the user choose which to install.

· Also, you can make icon graphics immensly ugly and non-obvious.  Be
  especially wary if your icon consists of arrows, boxes and/or images of
  floppy disks.

· Make sure your icons are unsnapshot.

I have a bit of a bad conscience regarding icons (being a CLI fiend), so
please forgive me if I break my own rules here.
