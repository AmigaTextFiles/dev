The source code of the VRML V1.0 viewer
with StormMesa support.

I "deserted" the Amiga Platform a long time ago, so
I decided to release all my (finished and unfinished)
work under the GPL license

This code abondoned since many years,
I don't even know if it compiles anymore

I used GCC as main compiler
I doubt this code will be usful at all,
but... who knows ;^)
