                             About the Author

 I'm  working  for  Union Systems, a company who develops games for PCs and
 PlayStation  consoles.  During last year I was developing several tools to
 speedup  and  help in development.  This Bug Reporter is a special version
 of  one  of  these  tools  which  I  am able to release into public.  This
 program  was  programmed  first  on  the  Amiga.   A lot of our tools were
 written first on Amigas, because Amigas are simple to code and you can put
 nice GUI without much hassle :)

 Anyway, have fun with this nice program and register, if you are using it.

                            CONTACT ADDRESSES

            The best way is to use e-mail. You can reach me at:

@node "Introduction" "Introduction   "

 This  program  is  a  useful tool for developers, bored with going through
 tons of bug reports, received in e-mails, on paper and in other, sometimes
 very  strange,  forms.  Thanks to Bug Reporter you dont have to think what
 was  written  here  and  there  and  what  author wanted to say with these
 curious  signs...   Now  you  can  easily  manage bug reports from various
 testers in a standarized form, which greatly enhances the speed of fixing
 these  bugs  and  shortens the development time of the whole project.  Bug
 Reporter  lets  you  better  organize  work  on the project, which is very
 important  in  these  days...   Perhaps  I  should  name  this program Bug
 Organizer...:)

 This  is  the  evaluation  version  of  Bug  Reporter.  There are only two
 differences  between  full  registered  version  and  this  version.  Full
 version has sorting enabled and saves all messages, not only one report.
@endnode

@node "Features" "Features       "

                               @{b}Key Features@{ub}

 - Simple,  intuitive  way  of creating bug reports for any kind of tested
   application.
 - Detailed description of each bug allows easy fixing.

 - Sorting by various criteria, including type, date and priority.

 - Support for e-mailing bug reports over Internet.

 - Built-it text editor for fast editing bug descriptions.

 - Merging several reports into one allows working with several testers.

 - Multiplatform tool with data compatibility.

 - Overall, very useful utility for every developer around :)
@endnode

@node "SystemRequirements" "Requirements   "

                        @{b} System requirements@{ub}

 Bug  Reporter  requires an Amiga with operating system 2.04 (V37) or above
 and   reqtools.library  to  run.   All  memory  requirements  are  handled
 dynamically,  so  you  are  able  to use it even if you are low on memory.
 Hard disk is not required.

 Bug  Reporter  also  uses one of TCP/IP stacks, available for Amigas like
 AmiTCP or Miami.
@endnode

@node "Instalation" "Installation   "

                            @{b} Installation@{ub}

 There  is  no  installation  script  for  Bug Reporter supplied right now,
 sorry.   This  release  can be installed so easily on your system that you
 should  be able to perform that task manually.  If not, you're not advised
 to use Bug Reporter anyway.

 Copy  BugReporter  and BugReporter.info to any location on your hard drive
 or disk.  If not already present, copy reqtools.library into your sys:libs
 drawer.

 After these steps, Bug Reporter can be started via Shell or Workbench.
@endnode

@node "Usage" "Usage          "

                               @{b} Usage@{ub}
 
 After  starting  Bug  Reporter from either Shell or Workbench, you'll find
 its @{"main screen" link "mainwindow" 0}  opened.   Most  actions  can  be  performed  by  clicking
 on the appropriate buttons and selecting options from the @{"menu" link "Menus" 0}.
@endnode

@node "futureplans" " Future plans    "

 Currently,  I  don't  have much time for planning anything big.  Changes I
 would like to make in the Amiga version are:
 - better editor with more options.
 - a progress requester during sending e-mail.
 - allow to get reports from a server, using POP3 protocol (almost done)
 Changes in all versions:
 - make it into Internet/Intranet database, based on a server/client
   architecture (with TCP or UDP used to exchange datas and not e-mail
   protocols)
 - any other ideas ?
@endnode

@node "history" "History         "

 - Version 1.0. First public release.
 
 - all other older versions were internal and not publicly available.
@endnode

@node "texteditor" "Built-in Text Editor"

 Bug Reporter has a small built-in text editor for editing bug descriptions
 and  developer's  remarks.   This a very basic editor and this is the only
 part of the program which probably will change in the future.  The size of
 a  text  you can enter is limited only by available memory - everything is
 kept  as  lists.   Use cursor keys, backspace, del to edit and move around
 the text.  Click on close gadget to finish editing.

 @{"Create New Project" link "Createnewprojwin" 0} window  will appear.  After entering all required datas
 and  clicking on OK, you'll be asked for deleting of all existing reports.
 You can choose "Yes", which will delete them, or "No" to let them stay.
 Then the program will return to the main window.
@endnode

 reports.   You  can  choose  "Yes", which will delete them, or "No" to let
 them  stay.   If  you  are only making changes and you don't want to loose
 already  entered  raports,  please  click  on "No".  Then the program will
 return to the main window.
@endnode

@node "deletefixedbugs" "Delete Fixed Bugs"

 This menu let you delete all reports marked as FIXED or DONE.  This option
 is  very useful for clearing report file from fixed bugs - leaves only the
 interesting ones - not fixed.  Firstly, you'll be asked for confirmation.
 REMEMBER: You can't undo this operation! Deleted reports will be lost!
@endnode

@node "meregeotherfile" "Merge with other bug file"

 This is a very useful option, especially for maintaining big projects with
 a lot of betatesters and a lot of report files.  After selecting this menu
 item,  a  file  requester  will appear.  After selecting the file to merge
 with  primary  report  file, the program will add it at the end of current
 file.   If  there  is  no previously loaded report file, the selected file
 will become the primary.

 PLEASE NOTE: The main project description is taken from the primary file -
 the  project  description from other, merged files will not be used except
 Betatesters field.
@endnode

@node "sendbyemail" "Send Bug Report by E-Mail"

 When  selecting  this menu Bug Reporter will try to send current bug list
 to  email  address,  given in @{"Create or Modify Project" link "Createnewproject" 0} window, using SMTP
 host, if available.  This operation  will  require  one  of TCP/IP stacks
 available  for  Amigas, running in the background (tested with AmiTCP and
 Miami).
@endnode

@node "sortreports" "Sort Reports"

 This option lets you sort reports with selected criteria.  You can choose
 between  sorting  by  Priority,  Type and Date.  All bug reports are then
 also  internally  sorted by type (if sorting by priority was selected) or
 by priority (if sorting by type was selected).
@endnode

@node "about" "About..."

 This option will display usual copyright information, developers address
 and other interesting messages.
@endnode

@node "quit" "Quit"

 Selecting this option quits the program.

@node "Notes" "General notes"
  Here is a short description how to work with Bug Reporter.

Lets say, you are going to develop an utility or a game.  First, you should
create  a  project  and  enter  all required datas.  If you plan to receive
reports   via  InterNet,  you  need  to  supply  required  informations  in
appriopriate  fields.   Now,  after creating the first beta version of your
program,  you  should give it to every betatester, together with Betatester
BugReporter - a version created especially for them.  They can send reports
directly  over the Internet using Bug Reporter, or save reports and use one
of  their favourite mail programs to e-mail them to you - the developer (or
they can even use the post office...;).  After merging all received reports
together,  you  can  start fixing bugs.  Several hours, days, weeks or even
months  later,  when you are ready, you should send back the report file to
betatesters - you can put there explanations or additional informations for
them  about  each  bug  reported and not fixed.  After a few such turns you
should hopefully get a final, release version of your program.  Now you can
let users of this final version test it and find some more bugs :)

Good luck...
