PrettyPrint is the most recent masterpiece : it helps you to print files in
many different ways : on two parallel columns, with file information on top
of each page, with line numbers, as an hexadecimal dump, ... make great use
of printer's abilities, theorically works on any preference supported
printer (tested with STAR LC-10 and STAR laser printers) and print exactly
the number of lines your printer is able to print (looking in your
preferences to find this information).
Great file requester (requires arp library).
Shareware : if you use it, send me $15 ! (or the equivalent in any EEC
currency, as usual).
