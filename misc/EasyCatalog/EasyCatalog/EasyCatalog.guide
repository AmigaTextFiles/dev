EasyCatalog is a editor for .catalog files. This version is a beta-release.
The main program is totally operational, but there is no real user-guide yet
for this program.
In version 1.0 there should be on-line help via the 'Help' key and a
user-guide available in English and Dutch (Nederlands).
Also there should be a installer script using @{"Installer" link Installer} from Commodore.

The reason I released this version is that I think it's a real handy
utility for all coders that want to use the locale.library. Most of the
coders known how to use programs like these and don't need a user-guide
so hard.
