@NODE PSP "Personal Software Process (PSP)"

"The personal software process (PSP) is a self-improvement process designed
 to help you control, manage, and improve the way you work.  It is a
 structured framework of forms, guidelines, and procedures for developing
 software.  Properly used, the PSP provides the historical data you need to
 better make and meet commitments and it makes the routine elements of your
 job more predictable and more efficient.

 The PSP is not a magic answer to all your software engineering problems.
 Although it can suggest where and how you can improve, you must make the
 improvements yourself."

Excerpts from @{U}A Discipline for Software Engineering@{UU}

@NODE Maple "Amiga Maple V Release 3"

Maple is a mathematical software package which enables its users to
manipulate mathematical expressions in their natural symbolic form.  This
means that Maple is capable of solving complex mathematical problems and
giving exact solutions in their symbolic form.

This package uses Maple as its mathematical engine to process your PSP
data and display the results in both numeric and graphical forms.  You will
need at least Maple V Release 3 to use the functions.

I am using Maple to manipulate my PSP data and determine what functions are
most useful.  Once I have a set of functions which I use on a regular basis,
I will likely code the functions myself and remove the dependency on Maple.
In essence, I'm using Maple as a stepping stone on my way to an automated
PSP process that precisely meets my needs.

@NODE MaplePSP "Maple PSP Functions"

The following functions are available:

  prediction_interval - Calculate range and prediction interval
  plot_relationship   - Plots data relationship


Full documentation for these functions is included in the Maple source code
and can be accessed using the Maple help facility.

If you do not have Maple, the source code is in ASCII and can be viewed
using Multiview.
