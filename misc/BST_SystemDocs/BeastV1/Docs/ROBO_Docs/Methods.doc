Methods/Methods

NAME
	  Introduction -- Method definitions. (V1 Bravo)


FUNCTION
	  Local methods, these method id's may be use by classes to define their own
	  private methods, special care must be taken when doing so. Delegation of
	  these throughout the parents or children can be dangerious, this because
	  of BEAST is a dynamic system and therefore it is possible that several
	  'other' objects are inserted. And there could be a conflict because classes
	  have the same method id defined for other uses.
	  When developers are defining their own classes they can ask for a pre-
	  defined 'slot' of methods which they can use. Send a message to
	  weertj@IAEhv.nl.
	  Developers however are strongly recommended to use the standard BEAST methods.
	  In this way the classes have a similiar behaviour.

	  Now the general implementation of the BEAST methods is given, please note that
	  this is _only_ the general description. These are the minimum demands
	  the method must comply to. Every class can give a different implementation
	  to the method as long as the general description is maintained.
