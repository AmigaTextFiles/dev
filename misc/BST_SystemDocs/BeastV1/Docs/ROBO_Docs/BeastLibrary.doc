FUNCTION
	  Add a method to a class, every method may have several method-routines.
	  The Beast system has a large number of pre-defined method ID's.
	  There are a number of free slots for local methods. Please consider
	  very carefully when using local methods ID. Those are not supported
	  among other classes. Also _NEVER_ use method delegation (MTHF_DOPARENTS,
	  MTHF_DOCHILDREN..etc..) when using local methods. In the BEAST OO system
	  objects are _never_ sure who parents or children are, even if you add them
	  yourself.
	  Free slots for local method ID's:
		OBM_local0	=	0x00000040 - 0x0000007F
		OBM_local1	=	0x00000100 - 0x000007FF

		OBM_local3	=	0x00100000 - 0x001FFFFF

	  The method ID's with the lowest number have the highest priority. In
	  V1 Alpha the priority is not yet implemented, but it will be in the future.


INPUTS
	  Class       - Pointer to the class.
	  MethodStart - The start of the method routine.
	  Method_ID   - The Method_ID number.


RESULT
	  Result - =NULL when Error.

	  struct obj_OutputLink *OBJ_CreateConnection( struct BST_Object *, struct BST_Object *, BST_Method, BST_Method );


FUNCTION
	  Create a connection between two objects. Every Method can be connected to any
	  other method. Connections between objects running at the same task will be
	  a direct connection. When connecting to object of different task the routine
	  will insert an intermediair (not implemented in V1 Alpha). The same when connecting
	  between two objects at two different computer systems.
	  A connection can have multiple inputs and outputs. But a things must be take into
	  consideration. When a 'FromMethod' is connected to several other methods the
	  TagList (which is the data) is shared among the connected objects, which means
	  that if the first object changes something in the TagList, the others will also
	  see it.


INPUTS
	  FromObject - Pointer to the 'From' object.
	  ToObject   - Pointer to the 'To' object
	  FromMethod - The Method ID number of the FromObject.
	  ToMethod   - The Method ID number of the ToObject.


RESULT
	  Result - 0 = An error has occured. Also when FromObject or ToObject
		       is zero. Otherwise, pointer to the obj_OutputLink.

	  A double linked connection is created, an OIL_Connection
	  and an OOL_Connection structure.

		  This method is triggered on 'BTA_MainObject'.
		BTA_Object1	- af[R]
		  The start point of the OBM_FOREACH method. The children
		  objects of _this_ object are processed.
		BTA_Object2	- af[FR]
		  The tag is always filled with the current child object.
		  With this tag the called method can find out which object
		  the OBM_FOREACH has processed.
