==========

This example shows the use of dynamic parent/child behaviour.
The example class is a simple 'Double' class, which just has
1 instance field (Number N).

How it works
------------

The 'my_DoubleClass' only has two method defined;

OBM_GETATTR - Set's the BTA_LongNumber to the object instance N. It also
	      print's out the N values of the parent objects. See the
	      OBJ_MethodToParent function, technically spoken the MTHF_DOPARENTS
	      flag in this example could be omited. This because only
	      one parent object will be called, why?, there is only one
	      value to fill in (BTA_NumberOf = 1), after this the MTHF_DOPARENTS
	      flag is reset.
	      It is good practice (and required) to set the MTHF_DOPARENTS flag
	      because it is possible that there are _other_ objects inserted
	      between your objects.

OBM_SETATTR - Set's the instance N to BTA_LongNumber. It sets also the children
	      objects if the MTHF_PASSTOCHILD was set. To do this the ti_Data
	      is multiplied by 2, the nr_attr is increased with 1 because
	      otherwise the BTA_NumberOf tag is processed and the MethodFlags
	      will be reseted. Finally the BTF_Ignore is cleared.

Now one OBM_SETATTR call of the root parent object with the MTHF_PASSTOCHILD
flags is enough to set all objects.
