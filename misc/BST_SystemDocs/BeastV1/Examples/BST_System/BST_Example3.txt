Example3.c
==========

The function of this example is similiar to Example2, only now the
example is based on inheritance.

The MATH_aClass will be the superclass of the others.

How it works
------------

One thing that is very different is the "math_a.instance" file.
This represents the instance of the MATH_aClass superclass. If we
define a class with MATH_aClass as superclass we must include this
file in the instance. The math_xy_Instance uses besides the
"math_a.instance" another item (LONG Y). The "math_a.instance" file
is in this example stored in the current directory, the instances
of public

The main() function has been slightly changed. Important is to _first_
fully define the superclass (MATH_aClass). After this the other
classes can be defined. The BST_MakeClass is replaced by the
BST_MakeSubClass function.
Now we only have to add the 'override' methods.

The classes
-----------

The MATH_aClass class is the biggest class, this class is the superclass
of the others.

mth_a_Init    - Just sets the instance A to 1.
mth_a_InputX  - Builds a TagList containing a BTA_Y tag with the instance
		A, this TagList is send to the method connected to the
		OBM_OUTPUT method of this object.
mth_a_OutputX - Just triggers the OBM_INPUT of this object.
mth_a_SetAttr - The set attribute function..uhm... to set just the A instance
		field.

The other classes are subclasses of the MATH_aClass and are therefore much
smaller.

MATH_x2Class:

mth_x2_InputX - This is the only 'overiden' method, this because now the class
		must 'output' the TagList with the A*X*X formula.
		VERY IMPORTANT!: the MTHF_BREAK flag, this flag tells the beast
		engine that _no more_ routines of _this_ method must be called.
		If this flag isn't set the OBM_INPUT method routine of the
		MATH_aClass is called again !!!... but sometimes this could be
		just the thing you want. The methods of the subclasses are always
		called first. In the new versions of the beast.library it will be
		possible to queue the methods.

MATH_xClass:

mth_x_InputX  - The same story as for mth_x2_InputX, only now the formula is
		A*X.

MATH_xyClass:
This class has three method overides.

mth_xy_Init    - Set the Y instance to 0, please NOTE(!) that the MTHF_BREAK flag
	 	 is not there, this because the mth_a_Init is also neccesary to set
		 the A instance.
mth_xy_InputY  - This method will calculate the result just as in BST_Example2.
mth_xy_OutputY - The starting method as in BST_Example2.
