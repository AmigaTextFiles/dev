Describes functions in libraries
.description
By  selecting the library you wish to consult, you will be presented with a
list  of  its  functions.  Just clic on the one you're interested in, and a
requester containing the following information will appear:

 - the function's name
 - a short summary of what it does
 - its offset
 - the structures and registers it uses
 
Naturally enough, the information provided is not comprehensive; OFL is no
replacement  to  the  autodocs.   Its  main  aim is to provide you with the
minimum  information needed and spare you hours of tedious research through
tons  of  documentation.  For more details, you will have to go through the
autodocs and/or the 'Rom Kernal Reference Manuals'.
