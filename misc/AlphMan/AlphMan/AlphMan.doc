AlphMan run only under OS >= 2.04.


AlphMan is designed for programmers that want to create an intuition- or
gadtools-interface with keysupport for each gadget.

Upto now this could be very difficult, to get sure to use unique characters
for each gadget.

AlphMan now simplifies this.

You have just to open the window and type all used keys into the activated
window. Each key is represented by a gadget. If you type one key for the
first time, the dependent gadget will be disabled. If you press the same
key a second time the screen will flash and you know this key is still be
used for another gadget. Certainly this can be also controlled visually.

The Clear gadget enables all gadgets.

The Toggle gadget toggles all gadget between disabled and enabled.

The quit gadget leaves AlphMan.

Oh !!!

AlphMan is FreeWare. You may copy and use it freely.

Have fun
