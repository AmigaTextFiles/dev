                            GamePort Device ToolKit


          Ever get tired of constantly writing the same code over and over
          to utilize an Amiga device?  I did!  That's why I put together
          this 'Toolkit' of routines to access these devices.  This is the
          first in a series of 'Toolkits' I've been building lately.

          This ToolKit provides access to the GamePort device, and its
          associated hardware, with the minimum of fuss.  There are full
          link-time libraries for SAS/C 5.10a and Manx C 5.0.  There is
          also a shared library, called GamePort.library, which can be
          installed in the LIBS: directory, along with a pragmas file, a
          .fd file, and link-time glue routine libraries.

          I have included a bevy of programs that I use to test the
          ToolKit, which provide numerous examples of how to use this
          software.

          The directory hierarchy of this distribution is laid out as
          follows:
