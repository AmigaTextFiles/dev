1. Introduction

ctg is a useful source text documentation tool for C++ programmers. It reads a
number of C++ source files, extracts class und struct definitions and generates
a graphical representation of the resulting class hierarchy as a PostScript(TM)
source. The output may be constrained to a specified subset of classes according
to the contents of a given configuration file.

The initial version of ctg was developed on a SPARCstation (SunOS 4.1.3) with
gcc 2.4.5. The Amiga version was compiled with SAS C++ 6.50 (which caused
several problems due to some restrictions and errors of this immature compiler).

This version is intended for usage in the shell. Although there are plans for a
version which also shows class hierarchies in windows with popup menues for
class methods, I probably won't realize them since I don't want to re-implement
SNiFF+ (a great integrated C++ environment for UNIX) on the Amiga.


2. Requirements

In order to parse C++ source texts accurately ctg uses an external C++ relies
on an external preprocessor. ctg has been tested extensively with cpp of gcc
2.4.5 (SunOS) and gcc 2.6.3 (Amiga). Theoretically any ANSI-compliant 
preprocessor may be used.


3. Distribution contents

This distribution of ctg should contain the following files:

README ..................... this file

c/ctg ...................... Amiga binary

doc/ ....................... documentation files
  ctg.man .................. man page as ASCII file with control codes
  ctg.1 .................... troff source for ctg.man
  ctg.frm .................. FrameMaker4(TM) document of ctg.1
  ctg.ps ................... PostScript output of ctg.frm

env/ctg.prefs .............. default configuration file

examples/ .................. example class trees
  ctg.ps 
  gddt.ps
  GDId.ps
  tkit.ps


4. Installation

The installation of ctg is simple. Just copy the binary c/ctg to a directory of
your command path and the default configuration env/ctg.prefs to ENVARC: and
ENV:. If you use cpp of gcc without the compilers, don't forget the assignment
GNU: to the root of your alternate compiler system.
