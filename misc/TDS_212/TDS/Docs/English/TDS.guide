Introduction
************

    Twilight Development System (@{b}TDS@{ub}) provides an integrated
environment for writing and compiling source files like Turbo Pascal or
Borland C++. The main program of the package is a powerful text editor
called Twilight Editor @{b}Ted@{ub} which includes an integrated project
manager. This project manager simplifies and speeds up the development
of programs composed of different source files (modules).  With @{b}TDS@{ub}
it's possible to compile and link these modules into an executable file
with a single command and if the compiler finds some errors, they will
be reported directly by the editor. @{b}TDS@{ub} doesn't provide its own
compiler, but can use any compiler or assembler callable from Shell. It
can interface directly with many common compilers and assemblers like
DICE C, SAS C, Lattice C, Aztec C, DevPac, A68k, PCQ, GNU-C, Amiga-E,
Oberon and even programs like TeX, CatComp and MakeInfo. If the
compiler is not supported, it's possible to write a little interface
program to convert the error messages in a format readable by the
editor. The compile process will be executed concurrently using another
program called Twilight Make (@{b}TMake@{ub}), so the user can continue to edit
the source files while the compiler is working.

    Twilight Editor @{b}Ted@{ub} has many functions to support the creating and
editing of source files. The number of files which can be open at the
same time is limited only by the amount of free memory and so is the
length of a single text file and line. For every file @{b}Ted@{ub} remembers
every change done and allows with the commands @{"Undo" Link "Edit-Undo"} and @{"Redo" Link "Edit-Redo"} to go back
through the changes. It also supports many commands to handle
horizontal and vertical blocks (like @{"Cut" Link "Edit-Cut"}, @{"Copy" Link "Edit-Copy"}, @{"Paste" Link "Edit-Paste"}, @{"Indent" Link "Edit-Indent"}) and to
search for strings in the file.

Requirements
************

    Twilight Development System @{b}TDS@{ub} 2.12 runs on any Amiga with
Kickstart 2.04 (V37) and greater. If available, it will use the
@{b}locale.library@{ub} to support localization. It can also use the
@{b}reqtools.library@{ub} V38, but the library is not required to run the
software.

Installation
************

    To install @{b}TDS@{ub} you can use the @{b}Installer@{ub} program from Commodore. To
start the installation process simply double-click the icon called
@{b}Install TDS@{ub} and follow the instructions. The installation script will
modify your @{b}user-startup@{ub} to include an assignment to the directory
containing the programs which will be called @{b}TDS:@{ub}. You have also the
choice to install some example project files which will help you in
building your own project files.

    If you don't have the @{b}Installer@{ub} program, then you can manually
install the software creating a directory and copying there all files.
Finally add an @{b}assign TDS: <your directory>@{ub} to the file @{b}user-startup@{ub}.

Twilight Editor (Ted)
*********************

    This is the main program of the package. It can be run from either
the Workbench or the Shell. When running on the Workbench screen @{b}Ted@{ub}
will open its windows as AppWindows which means that if you want to
open a file, just drop its icon into one of the windows and the file
will be loaded.

@{b}STARTUP@{ub}
     ARexx script to execute on startup

@{b}PUBSCREEN@{ub}
     name of the public screen to use

@{b}FONTNAME@{ub}
     name of the font to use

@{b}FONTSIZE@{ub}
     height of the font to use

@{b}CX_POPKEY@{ub}
     hotkey to access the commodity

Menu Compile
============

    This menu contains the commands to compile source files, to build an
entire executable program and to run and debug it. All the commands use
the project file defined with the commands of the @{"Project" Link "Menu Project"} menu.

    The commands @{"Compile" Link "Compile-Compile"}, @{"Build" Link "Compile-Build"} and @{"Build All" Link "Compile-Build All"} are not built into the
editor, but their execution is demanded to @{b}TMake@{ub}. When one of these
commands has been selected, @{b}Ted@{ub} starts @{b}TMake@{ub} which executes the command
and if it finds some errors, returns an error list to @{b}Ted@{ub}. Using the
multitasking facilities of the operating system @{b}TMake@{ub} runs in
background, so you can continue to edit your source files. Also these
commands open a console window where it's possible to follow the
compiling process and to interrupt it with Ctrl-C. This feature can be
disabled with the @{b}No TMake Window@{ub} option of the @{"Options" Link "Project-Options"} requester.

Menu Project
============

    This menu contains all the commands necessary to create, open and
save project files. The project file contains the names of the source
files (modules) of the program, the options for the translators
(compiler, assembler, etc.), linker and debugger and the work
directories. Once you have created a project, you can use the commands
@{"Compile" Link "Compile-Compile"}, @{"Build" Link "Compile-Build"} and @{"Build All" Link "Compile-Build All"} to compile a single source file or to
rebuild the entire executable file.

Project/Translators
-------------------

    Opens a requester which defines the translators used by the
project. A translator is a compiler, assembler or any other program
which @{b}translates@{ub} a source file into an object file. When @{b}TMake@{ub} tries to
compile a source file, it searches through the list of translators to find a
source extension matching the extension of the source file. Once a
source file has been compiled into an object file, the extension of the
object file will be compared with object extension used by the linker.
If the match fails, the object file becomes a source file and the
iteration restarts at the search for a translator. This way you can use
a compiler, which compiles a source file into an assembler file, then
this assembler file will be translated by the assembler and finally
linked by the linker.

    Using the buttons @{b}Add@{ub}, @{b}Delete@{ub}, @{b}Edit@{ub}, @{b}+@{ub}, @{b}-@{ub}, you can add, delete,
modify and reorder the translators. To modify a translator use the @{b}Edit@{ub}
button or double-click on the name of the translator. This will open
the @{b}Translator@{ub} requester.

@{b}Name@{ub}
     Name of the translator.

@{b}Command@{ub}
     Command of the translator.
          e.g. "sc" (for SAS C)

@{b}Debug Opt.@{ub}
@{b}Final Opt.@{ub}
     @{b}Debug Opt.@{ub} are the options used if the @{b}Use Debug Options@{ub} is set in
     the @{"Options" Link "Project-Options"} requester, otherwise @{b}Final Opt.@{ub} will be used.

     The following strings have a special meaning:

    @{b}%src@{ub}
          Name of the source file.

    @{b}%mod@{ub}
          Name of the source file without extension.

    @{b}%base@{ub}
          Name of the source file without extension and path.

    @{b}%obj@{ub}
          Name of the object file.

    @{b}%opt@{ub}
          Local options of the source file.

    @{b}%err@{ub}
          Name of the error file (if not present, then the standard
          output will be used).

     e.g.
          @{b}"-d -o%obj %src" and the source file "text.c"@{ub} becomes
          @{b}-d -otext.o text.c@{ub}.

@{b}Source Ext.@{ub}
     File extension of the source files.

@{b}Object Ext.@{ub}
     File extension of the object files.

@{b}Object Dir.@{ub}
     Directory of the object files.

@{b}Ignore Warnings@{ub}
     If set, ignores all warning messages.

@{b}Check Headers@{ub}
     Option used only for C source files: if set @{b}TMake@{ub} checks for every
     source file if an include file has been modified. If so, it
     compiles the source file. The checking will be done only for
     include files in this format:

          @{b}#include "......"@{ub}
          
          and not for:
          
          @{b}#include <......>@{ub}

@{b}Single Pass@{ub}
     If set, @{b}TMake@{ub} will use only one translator on the source file, and
     will not check if the object file has the extension required by
     the linker.

@{b}Select Converter@{ub}
@{b}Converter@{ub}
     Use these gadgets to select the converter program for the
     compiler/assembler. The purpose of the converter is to translate
     the error messages coming from the compiler/assembler into a format
     readable by the editor. The list gadget displays all converters
     which are available in the directory @{b}TDS:converters@{ub}. If you want to
     use a compiler which doesn't have a converter, you can easily write
     your own one. All the converter has to do is to read from standard
     input the output of the compiler and to write to standard output
     the error messages with the following format:

          MyConverter <compiler_error_file >ted_error_file source_file
          
          @{b}<test.c> 10 2 E <Error Message>@{ub} for an error
          @{b}<test.c> 21 5 W <Error Message>@{ub} for a warning
          
          where
          <test.c>        : source file
          10              : row
          2               : optional column
          E or W          : error or warning
          <Error Message> : error message

     The converter program also receives the name of the source file as
     the first argument on the command line which sometimes is very
     helpful if the compiler didn't write the name of the source file
     in the error messages.

    @{b}%err@{ub}
          Name of the error file (if not present, then standard output
          will be used).

     e.g.

Twilight Make (TMake)
*********************

    @{b}TMake@{ub} is similar to the program @{b}make@{ub} used in the development of
programs composed of more than one source file. It checks every source
file if it has been modified and depending on the file extension (e.g.
@{b}.c@{ub} or @{b}.asm@{ub}) compiles or assembles it. Then it links all the object
files together to obtain the executable file. @{b}TMake@{ub} doesn't use
@{b}makefiles@{ub}, but instead relies on project files created with @{b}Ted@{ub}.

    It has been designed to interface to the most popular compilers like
SAS C, Lattice C, Aztec C, DICE C, PCQ, GNU-C, Oberon, and assemblers
like DevPac, A68k and even programs like TeX, CatComp and MakeInfo.
It's also possible to write a custom message converter if the compiler
used is not supported. @{b}TMake@{ub} can also be used as a standalone program
from Shell or Workbench to build projects created with @{b}Ted@{ub}.

    Usage: TMake PROJECT,FILE/K,ALL/S,PORTNAME/K,PRI=PRIORITY/K/N

@{b}PROJECT@{ub}
     name of the project file

@{b}FILE/K@{ub}
     if given, compiles only a single file

@{b}ALL@{ub}
     compiles all files, even if they have not been modified

@{b}PORTNAME@{ub}
     option used by @{b}Ted@{ub} to set the name of the message port used by
     @{b}TMake@{ub}

@{b}PRIORITY@{ub}
     priority of @{b}TMake@{ub}

Twilight Reference Generator (TRefs)
************************************

    @{b}TRefs@{ub} generates reference files used by the @{"Find Reference" Link "Search-Find Reference"} command.
With this command it's possible to get information about a particular
keyword, e.g. moving the cursor to the word @{b}Window@{ub} and selecting the
@{"Find Reference" Link "Search-Find Reference"} command will result in the loading of the file
@{b}intuition.h@{ub} and the editor positioning the cursor to the start of the
definition of the structure @{b}struct Window@{ub}. Currently @{b}TRefs@{ub} can be used
to generate reference files from include files @{b}#?.h@{ub}, autodocs files
@{b}#?.doc@{ub} and AmigaGuide files @{b}#?.guide@{ub}.

    Usage: TRefs REFS/K/A,FILES/M/A

@{b}REFS/K/A@{ub}
     name of reference file to create

@{b}FILES/M/A@{ub}
     list of files to search

Here comes the format of the reference files for anybody who wants to
make his own reference generator:

     [file]
     keyword1=row1
     keyword2=row2
     ...

Using @{b}TRefs@{ub} with the file @{b}intuition.h@{ub} generates the following reference
file:

     [intuition/intuition.h]
     Menu=61
     MenuItem=89
     ...
     TabletHookData=1661
     [intuition/intuitionbase.h]
     IntuitionBase=66
     [intuition/preferences.h]
     Preferences=58
     [intuition/screens.h]
     DrawInfo=66
     Screen=133
     NewScreen=462
     ...

Special Thanks
**************

    Special thanks go to Enrico 'Fedro' Federigo for the Italian
translation of the documentation and for his many suggestions to
improve TDS and to Fredrik Lundström which helped me in finding and
eliminating a lot of bugs and Enforcer hits from the programs and
giving me many useful suggestions. I would also like to thank
Yann-Erick Proy for the French translation.

    I also want to thank all of you who sent me the bug reports and
suggestions to make the program better, and many thanks go to all the
registered users.
