Twilight Development System (TDS) provides an integrated environment
for writing and compiling source files like Turbo Pascal or Borland
C/C++. The main program of the package is a powerful text editor
called Twilight Editor (Ted) which includes an integrated project
manager. This project manager simplifies and speeds up the development
of programs composed of different source files (modules). With TDS
it's possible to compile and link these modules into an executable
file with a single command and if the compiler finds some errors, they
will be reported directly by the editor. TDS doesn't provide its own
compiler, but can use any compiler or assembler callable from Shell.
It can interface directly with many common compilers and assemblers
like DICE C, SAS C, Lattice C, Aztec C, DevPac, A68k, PCQ, GNU-C,
Amiga-E, Oberon and even programs like TeX, CatComp and MakeInfo. If
the compiler is not supported, it's possible to write a little
interface program to convert the error messages in a format readable
by the editor. The compile process will be executed concurrently using
another program called Twilight Make (TMake), so the user can continue
to edit the source files while the compiler is working.

To install TDS you can use the 'Installer' program from Commodore. To
start the installation process simply double-click the icon called
'Install TDS' and follow the instructions. The installation script
will modify your 'user-startup' to include an assignment to the
directory containing the programs which will be called 'TDS:'. You
have also the choice to install some example project files which will
help you in building your own project files.

If you don't have the 'Installer' program, then you can manually
install the software creating a directory and copying there all files.
Finally add an 'assign TDS: <your directory>' to the 'user-startup'.
