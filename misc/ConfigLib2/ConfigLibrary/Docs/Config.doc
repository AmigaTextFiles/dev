    NAME
	WriteConfig -- write an item of data to a configuration file

    SYNOPSIS
	int r = WriteConfig(filename, section, item, data);
	                       D0        D1     D2    D3

	char *filename;
	char *section;
	char *item;
	char *data;

    FUNCTION
	Writes the data to the specified config file, in the specified
	section, using the specified item keyword.

	If the config file does not exist, WriteConfig() will create it.
	If the section doesn't exist, it'll be created. If the item
	doesn't exist, it'll be added to the appropriate section; otherwise
	the existing data for the item will be overwritten with the new
	data.

    EXAMPLE
	r = WriteConfig("Test.cfg","RecentFiles","File1","SYS:Data");

    INPUTS
	filename	- Name of the file to write config data to
	section		- Name of the section within the file
	item		- Name of the item within the section
	data		- Data to be written to the config file

    RESULTS
	If everything works, returns CFG_WRITE_SUCCESS. In the event of
	problems, returns CFG_WRITE_FAIL.

    NAME
	WriteConfigNumber -- writes a long integer to a configuration file

    SYNOPSIS
	int r = WriteConfigNumber(filename, section, item, data);
	                             D0        D1     D2    D3

	char *filename;
	char *section;
	char *item;
	long data;

    FUNCTION
	Writes the long integer to the specified config file, in the
        specified section, using the specified item keyword.

	If the config file does not exist, WriteConfig() will create it.
	If the section doesn't exist, it'll be created. If the item
	doesn't exist, it'll be added to the appropriate section; otherwise
	the existing data for the item will be overwritten with the new
	data.

    EXAMPLE
	r = WriteConfigNumber("Test.cfg","RecentFiles","RecentCnt",4);

    INPUTS
	filename	- Name of the file to write config data to
	section		- Name of the section within the file
	item		- Name of the item within the section
	data		- Long integer to be written to the config file

    RESULTS
	If everything works, returns CFG_WRITE_SUCCESS. In the event of
	problems, returns CFG_WRITE_FAIL.

config.library/ReadConfig

    NAME
	ReadConfig -- read an item of data from a configuration file

    SYNOPSIS
	int r = ReadConfig(filename, section, item, buffer, bufsize, default);
	                      D0        D1     D2     D3       D4       D5

	char *filename;
	char *section;
	char *item;
	char *buffer;
	int bufsize;
	char *default;

    FUNCTION
	Reads data from a configuration file, placing it in to your buffer.

	If for any reason the data cannot be read (config file doesn't
	exist, specified section doesn't exist, specified item can't be
	found within the section), the default value will be copied to your
	buffer, and CFG_READ_SUCCESS will be returned. You don't need to
	worry about whether config files/sections/items actually exist.

    EXAMPLE
	r = ReadConfig("Test.cfg","RecentFiles","File1",buf,BUFSIZE,"RAM:Test");

    INPUTS
	filename	- Name of the file to read config data from
	section		- Name of the section within the file
	item		- Name of the item within the section
	buffer		- A string buffer to receive the config data
	bufsize		- The maximum size of your buffer
	default		- A string to be returned if the config data cannot
			  be found

    RESULTS
	If everything works, returns CFG_READ_SUCCESS. In the event of
	problems (usually, your buffer is not large enough to receive the
	configuration data), returns CFG_READ_FAIL.

    NAME
	ReadConfigNumber -- read a long integer from a configuration file

    SYNOPSIS
	long v = ReadConfigNumber(filename, section, item, default);
	                             D0        D1     D2     D3

	char *filename;
	char *section;
	char *item;
	long default;

    FUNCTION
	Reads a long integer from a configuration file.

	If for any reason the data cannot be read (config file doesn't
	exist, specified section doesn't exist, specified item can't be
	found within the section), the default value will be returned,
	and CFG_READ_SUCCESS will be returned. You don't need to worry
	about whether config files/sections/items actually exist.

    EXAMPLE
	v = ReadConfigNumber("Test.cfg","RecentFiles","RecentCnt",4);

    INPUTS
	filename	- Name of the file to read config data from
	section		- Name of the section within the file
	item		- Name of the item within the section
	default		- A long value to be returned if the config data
			  cannot be found

    RESULTS
	Returns the long integer read from the config file. This function
	is assumed never to fail. If the config item specified is not
	numerical, 0 will be returned.
