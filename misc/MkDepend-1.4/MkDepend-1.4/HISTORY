** 09-Nov-1997, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.4
 - GNUMakefile: new Makefile for SAS/C and GNU-Make.
 - Added SAS/C patches and bugfixes submitted by Flavio Stanchini:
   one allocation was done one byte too small (main.c), under
   SAS/C expand_args() is simulated (args.c) and the end of a comment
   was not recognized after an even number of '*' (reader.c).
 - MkDepend now also looks for GNUMakefile when given no explicite
   filename. (main.c)
 - The list of included files is sorted alphabetically. This is
   achieved by keeping the internal dependency lists in alphabetical
   order. Using linear insertion herefor does not seem fast, but
   as it's done while the data is coming in, the complexity is in
   fact O(1). (nodes.c)
 - Debugged removal of write-protected Makefile and Makefile backups.
   (main.c)
 - New option -K=KEEP/S to keep the backup of the Makefile.
   New option -Y=STYLE/K for different output styles.
   (main.c, args.c/h)
 - New option -H=HIDE/K to hide specific include files from the
   dependency lists in the Makefile. (main.c, args.c/h, nodes.c/h)
 - New options CLEAN/S and PROPER/S to clean up the Makefile.
   (main.c, args.c/h, reader.c/h)

** 02-Mar-1996, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.3
 - Oops, when confronted with target/source relations, MkDepend put the
   source name into the dependency list as well. Though intentional, this
   had the potential to confuse implicit make rules. Now this behaviour
   is optional, triggered by specifying '+' with the object extension.
   (main.c, args.ch)
 - RCS tweaks to the Makefiles.

** 25-Feb-1996, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.2
 - main.c (output_tree, output): Added output of includers of a file.
 - main.c (readfiles): If a file can't be found, its users known so far
     are printed in the warning notice.
 - nodes.c,h: Added .pUsers (List of includers of this file) to the Node
     structure, extended routines nodes_depend() and nodes_deplist()
     accordingly.
 - Put under RCS (the Makefiles still need tweaking for this, though).

** 04-Feb-1996, Lars Düning **
 - main.c (output, getargs, main): The program is now able to write the
     list of dependencies into a separate file as well.
 - main.c (output_tree): New to write the dependency tree into a file.
 - args.ch, main.c: Exported argument parsing into args.c.
 - reader.c (reader_openrw): Immediate writing if no file to read is
     opened is now possible.

** 13-Oct-1995, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.1
 - reader.c (reader_copymake2): Copies the remainder of the original
     Makefile starting with the second tagline.

** 12-Oct-1995, Lars Düning **
 - main.c (make_objname): %p pattern expanded to %[-][<][<number>]p.
 - Makefile, DMakefile: Making the 'archive' missed some files.

** 18-Sep-1995, Lars Düning **
 - RELEASE 1.0
