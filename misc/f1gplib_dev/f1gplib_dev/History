36.10 (9.11.99) - 4180 bytes

o Added workaround for semaphore calls, to regain compatibility with KS 1.3
============================================================================
36.9 (2.8.99) - 4148 bytes

o Internal release
============================================================================
36.8 (19.7.99) - 4160 bytes

o Public beta
o Added more semaphore protection to help stamp out deadlocks which
  could occur under certain circumstances
o Removed "F1GP Watcher" task - rewrote notification routines
  accordingly (it was possible for F1GP to lock up while exiting the
  cockpit or quitting)
============================================================================
36.7 (24.5.99) - 4684 bytes

o Internal release
o Altered the F1GP detection routine to handle multiple instances of
  F1GP in memory
============================================================================
36.6 (7.6.98) - 4700 bytes

o Changed FMODE for AGA ($000f)
o Added backwards compatibility for GPPatch for when this lib is used
  with F1GP-Ed 3.36 or earlier

36.5 (2.6.98) - 4644 bytes
============================================================================
36.1 (15.2.98) - 4148 bytes

o Now patches low-level F1GP display to use scan-doubling, if necessary
o Added patches to make F1GP use faster graphics fetch modes on AGA
============================================================================
35.4 (22.8.97) - 2516 bytes

o Fixed the UseVBR patch - found another place in F1GP where the interrupt
  vectors are rewritten + restored
============================================================================
35.3 (19.8.97) - 2332 bytes

o Added a new patch, which makes F1GP use the VBR.  This is installed
  automatically when calling f1gpDetect() (not on 68000 systems though)
o Rewrote the f1gpCalcChecksum() code (it's now smaller and quicker)
============================================================================
35.2 (8.2.97) - 1952 bytes

o Added copyright string to library code
o Minor code optimizations
============================================================================
35.1 (24.11.95) - 2072 bytes

o Added a new function f1gpCalcChecksum()
o Fixed World Circuit quit patch bug
============================================================================
34.3 (22.9.95) - 1984 bytes

o Fixed a bug in the quit patch removal routine
============================================================================
34.2 (17.9.95) - 1980 bytes

o Patched another location where F1GP quits - there are now 3 locations
  that are patched (3 longwords)
o Patched 2 ScreenToFront()s in F1GP and replaced with NOPs.  This change
  is not reverted when the library is expunged
o Patched F1GP's lap time calculation routine and replaced with Grant's new
  code.  This change is not reverted when the library is expunged
============================================================================
34.1 (4.9.95) - 1848 bytes
