These are some support files for ReSource v6.06 to help to
disassemble WHDLoad/Patcher/RawDIC Slaves.

To use easy automatical installation you need:
	perl
	make (gmake)
	basm (Barfly)
	RS: assign which points to the ReSource directory
perl and make implies ixemul.library.
If you dont have it or dont want to install it you have to
install manually by checking the makefile.

To install move this directory to RS:mysyms, then enter the
directory and execute make. All files should be created and
a new RS.macros file in RS: build. The old RS.macros will be
saved under RS.macros.backup.

To use just start ReSource. The new macros should be loaded.
You have the following new macros:

	Load Symbols WHD/Pat/Raw
		which will load all the provided User Symbols
		for WHDLoad/Patcher/RawDIC Slaves

	Disassemble Slave 1-3
		which disassembles the Slave structure, all
		valid fields upto Slave version 3 will be
		decoded
	Disassemble Slave 4-7
		all fields upto version 7
	Disassemble Slave 8-9
		all fields upto version 9
	Disassemble Slave 10
		all fields upto version 10
	Disassemble Slave Data
		decodes the subdir entry

	Disassemble RawDIC Slave
		decodes the RawDIC Slave structure
	Disassemble RawDIC Disk
		decodes the RawDIC Disk structure
	Disassemble RawDIC Track
		decodes the RawDIC Track structure
	Disassemble RawDIC File
		decodes the RawDIC File structure

Its recommended to execute first the 'Load Symbols WHD/Pat/Raw'
then 'Disassemble Slave 1-3'. Now you see which version the
Slave structure has and call the appropriate 'Disassemble
Slave' macro.
