you need the following software:
	ixemul.library	ftp://ftp.geekgadgets.org/pub/geekgadgets/amiga/m68k/alpha/ixemul/native/
	perl		aminet:dev/gg/perl571.lha
	WHDLoad 16.1+	http://www.whdload.de/whdload/
make sure:
	IXPIPE is mounted (see ixemul package)
	the timestamps of 'includes:whdload.i' and 'tdreason.i' are
	correct ('tdreason.i' must be newer)
BEWARE this may crash your machine!
running from RAM: is recommended
ATM only 68030-68060 is supported because mainly MMU stuff is checked
on 68030 you must have MMU option set in s:whdload.prefs
