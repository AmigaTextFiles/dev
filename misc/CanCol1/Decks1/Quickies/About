About the Quickies decks:

  Each of these decks deal with only a single topic.

AppEvent

  This demo works under AmigaDos 2.0 only.  This deck gives a simple
  example of using the Window's AppEvent script.  Drag an icon over this
  window and release it.  The selected file's icon image will be loaded
  into the deck and drawn within the window.  You can then drag this image
  within the window.

DrawBorder

  An example of using the supported Border styles.  All script commands
  used to draw the borders are found in the AfterAttachment script of
  this deck.

Qualifiers

  While this Deck's window is active, it will display the Keyboard
  qualifiers which are currently being pressed.  See this deck's
  timer Occurred script for how this was done.

ClockBar

  A simple deck to present the current time, date and memory allocation
  within a draggable bar.

DisableTimer

  An example of using the DetachObject and ReattachObject to start and stop
  a Timer Object.  See the OnRelease script of the button in this deck.

ViewOffset

  This deck demonstrates the use of the SetViewOffset and GetViewOffset
  commands.  Run this deck and then click and drag within the empty button
  in the window.  Your entire display will scroll about.  If you wish to
  return to your original positioning, simply press over the Reset button,
  or click on the close window button.

ExclusiveButtons
  
  This simply shows how to use radio buttons as a set of exclusive choices.

DosTest by M. J. Guerra

  This deck uses the STDOUT flag of the Dos command.  If this deck is
  started from a SHELL or CLI, the "ram:" directory will be listed to that
  CLI when the button is pressed.  If it was started from Workbench, then
  a new CLI will be opened to display the directory.

ButtonStyles by M. J. Guerra

  This deck displays the various ButtonStyles and highlights available in
  CanDo.

FormatValuePatterns

  This deck allows you to test and verify your understanding of the
  FormatValue function.  You can type a value or expression into one
  field, and a formatting "pattern" into the other, and quickly see
  the results.  The patterns can also be stored in a data file in case
  you want to keep them as references.

TheParser by M. J. Guerra

  This is another deck which demonstrates the use of the FormatValue
  command.

ToggleDeck

  This shows off how to use the CLIUtility 'ToggleWB'
