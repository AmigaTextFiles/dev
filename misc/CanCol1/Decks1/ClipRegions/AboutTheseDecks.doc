About the ClipRegions decks:

Boxes

  This example deck simply uses the InstallClipRegion command to protect
  a window's border's from any graphics commands which are used.  It then
  draws randomly sized and positioned boxes into the window to show that
  the borders are protected.

Ellipse

  This example deck does the same thing as the Boxes example, except it
  draws ellipses instead of boxes.

ScrollClipRegion

  This deck gives another demonstration of the use of Clip Regions.  It
  draws an initial pattern in the window, then protects a small area of
  the window from further change.  The contents of the window are then
  scrolled and changed to demonstrate that the clip region has been
  preserved.

NOTE:
  Whenever you are in Design Mode, CanDo Does a ClearClipRegions on
  your window.  As a result, when you load the Boxes and Ellipse
  Demos into CanDo, the ClipRegions will have been Cleared when you
  enter Browse Mode.  As a Result, it will look like there is not
  any ClipRegions (because there isn't).  If you resize the window,
  the ClipRegions will be re-installed.
