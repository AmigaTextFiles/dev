                           RELEASE NOTES:
                           ==============

I worked for 8 months on Vortex.. and didn't recieve a SINGLE
donation for my efforts. It was very dissapointing to say
the least. I'm releasing the CODE and hoping that those
who find it useful will send a donation of $1-$5.

I would very much appreciate the donation!

The code is FREEWARE. You may take and use ANY and ALL code
within your own programs and for ANY purpose. However, you
must also include a STATEMENT within your documentation
that my code was used in the creation process of your program.
Please... give credit where credit is due!

LONG LIVE THE AMIGA and CANDO!
