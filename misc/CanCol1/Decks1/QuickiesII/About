About the 1.6Examples decks:

  Each of these decks deal with new objects in CanDo 1.6
  
Proportional_Example

  This simply has three different proportional sliders (X, Y and XY styles)
  and one of them is sorta attached to a integer field.

!!! CAUTION !!!
  because each of these decks use the 2nd gameport they cannot work at the
  same time (only one application can allocate the port at a time.)

JoyStick_Example
  
  This simply shows off what information is passed to the gameport script.

JoySketch

  This is a working sketching program using the joystick (in port 2).  To
  select a new color click on the color with your mouse.  To clear the
  window just click on any other application and then click back on to the
  sketch window.  When you click with the mouse you can move where you
  are drawing.

Mouse2Sketch

  This is a working sketching program like joysketch but this one uses
  a second mouse (in port 2) to control the drawing pen (but the pointer is still
  controlled by the first mouse, crazy).  To select a new color click on the
  color with your mouse.  To clear the window just click on any other application
  and then click back on to the sketch window.  When you click with the mouse you
  can move where you are drawing.
