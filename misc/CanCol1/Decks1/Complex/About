About the ComplexExamples decks:

  NOTE:  All requesters used by the following decks are located in the
         subdirectory SubDecks.

CanCalc

  Yes, an actual, though limited, spreadsheet program!  Click on a
  section of the spreadsheet and enter the equation, string, or value
  which you wish that "cell" to contain.  Values are entered as numeric
  values; strings are entered in quotes.  The expressions are build from
  the value of the cells, e.g.  A1+B2+B3.

Graphit

  This deck allows you to graph expressions.  You can specify the
  expression and the range which should be graphed.  You can also add or
  delete the expressions to a file of expressions.  If you click on the
  "Figure Y Min&Max" button, Graphit will determine the appropriate Y
  ranges for the graph to use.  Pressing "Redraw Graph" will actually
  graph the expression.

NewPhone

  This is a new Phone book example, using the new DataBase functions and
  variables.  This demonstrates how entire documents can be made part of
  each record in a database.

SimpleReqExample

  This deck demonstrates the use of three types of requesters, located in
  the SubDecks directory, as the deck SimpleReq.  The first is a simple
  Message requester which displays a message and contains a button to
  remove the message.  The second requester is a YES NO type requester,
  which can be used to ask a question which has a yes or no answer.
  The third is a requester which allows you to type a response.

  To see how the requesters are opened, look at the OpenRequester commands
  in the OnRelease script of each of the buttons in this deck.  To see how
  the replies are handled, see the MessageFromSubDeck script of the Card,
  as well as the three routines, "Ok Comment", "Question Answered", and
  "Info Provided".

Budget
  The Budget deck is unquestionably the most complex example deck
  included with CanDo.  It uses may Advanced techniques which demonstrate
  CanDo's ability to create applications which rival commercially available
  software.

  If you are an advanced CanDo programmer, then this should provide ample
  demonstration of sophisticated "Data Structure" manipulation.

  Otherwise, you might be able to get some use out of it.
  
  See the Budget tutorial for more details.
