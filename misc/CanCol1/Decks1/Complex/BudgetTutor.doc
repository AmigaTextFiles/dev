	Here is a short tutorial to give you a feel of how the Budget
program works.

	First, lets start with a clean slate.  Select "Setup" from
the Budget Options Screen.  This Setup Selection Requester will
display various Setup options.  Select "Initialize All Data".
This will display a warning "All Data will be lost.".  Click Ok.
It will ask you for the Year.  The Current Year should be shown.
Simply click Ok.  It will tell you when it is complete (click OK
one more time.) Go back to the main screen by Clicking the
CloseButton on the Setup Selection Requester.


Prepare a sample Budget

	Click on the "Prepare Budget" button on the Budget Options
Screen.  This will display a "Spreadsheet looking" screen.  The
buttons on the left allow you to navigate through the Expense and
Income Categories.  The first column shows you the amount
budgeted for the current Category.  These should all be ZERO.
The Actual Column shows the totals for all transactions for the
current Category.  Because you have not entered any transactions,
these should all be ZERO also.

	The columns on the right side of the display show the budget
summery for all Expense and Income Categories.  (Currently ZERO)

	Click on the hourglass, next to "Category" in the lower left
corner.  This will display all of the Expense and Income
Categories.  We will start with "Misc.  Exp" so simply click OK.
The Arrow buttons allow you to step through the Categories.

	Click on the "Set All Months" button located at the top of
the first column.  This will display a requester allowing you to
set all months for the currently selected Category.  Enter "150"
into the field.  (As with all Dollar fields in this application,
you can enter arithmetic expressions such as "30 * 5".) When you
press RETURN or click OK, all monthly fields will be filled out
with 150.00 and the Budget Summery figures will be updated.  You
can modify any of the fields individually.

	If you fill out all months with the following figures, you
will have the basis for sample budget.  (This is not strictly
required for this example.)

	Misc. Exp	150
	Groceries	225
	Rent		525
	Household	175
	Utilities	125
	Clothes		100
	Entertain	100

	Payroll		1850
	Gifts		0
	Interest	20
	Misc. Inc	0

	If you filled these out as indicated, you will notice the
summery totals will reflect the following amounts:

	Income 22,440.  - Expense 16,800 = Net Income 5,640

(if only you could actually spend less than you earn!)

	Clicking the Close Button or the "Main Panel" button will
return you to the screen showing your Budget Options.

Enter Transactions

	Click on the button "Enter Transactions".  This will display
the Transaction Selector.  The Default Account will be Checking.
(You can examine the other choices by clicking the hour-glass.)
We will be working with the Checking Account for now.

	The remaining "Search Limits" don't make any difference
because you do not have any transactions.  Later, you can use
them to reduce the number of transactions you will see in the
Transaction List.

	Click OK to move on.

	You will see the Title "Checking" at the top, some fields for
the Account Balances, and an empty List of transactions.

	Because we are just getting started, we nee to set the
initial Balances.  Enter 1675.76 in the Balance Field and the
Confirmed Balance Field.  For now, the Statement Balance doesn't
matter.  However, a "difference" of -1675.76 will be shown.  If
this bothers you, put 1675.76 in the Statement Balance.

	Click "Add" to enter our first transaction.  This will bring
up a requester with a field for the following Items:

	Date		date of the transaction (shows the current date)

	Check#		Check number associated with transaction
				This can be empty if you wish

	Payee		Indicates where the money is going (more on this 
				later).

	Category	Indicate the Expense or Income Category for the
				Transaction. (more on transfers later)

	Amount		The numerical amount for the transaction

	If you wish to use a different date for this transaction,
make it in the current month for now.  Enter the Check# "3167".
This is used for informational reasons only.  Enter "Wal-Mart"
for the Payee.  When you press return the default Expense
Category "Misc.  Exp" will be shown.  Click on the hourglass.
Select Household from the list by double clicking on it.
Finally, enter the amount of "76.34".  Verify the Fields and
press OK.  If you would like to Cancel, simply click the
CloseButton and start over.

	The account Balance should show "1599.42".  Select Add again.
This time we are going to do a Deposit.  The easy way to do this
is to click on the Setup Deposit Button.  This will put "Deposit"
in the Payee field.  Deposits must have this in the Payee field.
The default Income Category of "Payroll" will be shown.  Entry
our net pay of "925.00".  (If you wished, you could enter Gross
pay and set up Expense categories for your deductions.)

	Now the Balance should show "2524.42".  That's all for now in
checking so click the CloseButton or "Main Panel".

	Click on the "Enter Transactions" button again.  This time we
want to enter transactions for "Savings".  Click on the Account
hourglass and select Savings.  Click Ok to enter the new
transactions.

	Enter the "4260.50" into the Balance Fields and Click "Add".
This time we are going to setup a transfer from Savings to
Checking.  Click "Setup Transfer" and select "Checking".  The
Category will default to "Xfer To".  Click on the Category
hourglass and select "Xfer From".  Enter the Amount "500.00" in
the Amount and click Ok.  This will show the transaction and
change the balance to "4767.50".

	Now return to the Main Panel, select "Enter Transactions" and
"Checking" for the Account.  You will notice the transfer is here
also.  (We could have created it here, but I wanted to
demonstrate the concept.) The Balance has been updated to show
"2024.42".  If you edit or Delete this transaction, the
corresponding transaction in Savings will be adjusted.

Reconciling Checkbook

	Your statement just came in!  Enter "2090.76" in the
Statement Balance.

	Let me tell you about a couple of shortcut keys now.  They
correspond to the four edit buttons at the bottom.

	F1 - Add
	F2 - Confirm
	F3 - Edit
	F4 - Delete

	In addition the Up & Down keys moves highlight cursor in the
transaction list up and down.

	Move the transaction cursor to the Deposit transaction by
using the Up and Down Keys or Clicking once on it.  Press the F2
key or click "Confirm".  The Confirmed Balance will show
"2600.76" and the Difference will be "-510.00".

	Move the cursor to the Savings Transfer.  Press F2 or click
"Confirm".  The Confirmed Balance will be "2100.76" and the
Difference "-10.00".

	Well, the statement included a $10.00 service charge.  Add
this transaction by pressing the F1 key or clicking "Add".  This
transaction can be "Misc.  Exp" for the amount of "10.00".  After
clicking "Ok", press F2 to confirm the transaction.  The
Difference should now be "0.00"
