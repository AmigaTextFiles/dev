This is Version .90 of HomeBudget

	It   was  created  while  Beta
Testing  CanDo Version 1.5.  It is
intended  to  demonstrate and test
the  advanced  capabilities of the
new CanDo.

	I  have  tried  to include all
the  necessary  capabilities  of a
complete Home Budget program.

These Include:

	o Multiple Accounts i.e.
	  Checking, Savings and
	  Credit Cards.

	o Tracking transactions for
	  Income and Expense budget
	  Categories.

	o Monthly budget tracking
	  for each Budget Category.

	o Non-budgeted transfers
	  between accounts.

	o Account Reconciliation
	  for confirmed transactions.

	o Yearly role-over of Budget
	  tracking and consolidation
	  of confirmed transactions.

Version  0.90  does  not  have the
Print  Reports  option.  All other
options should perform properly.

While  I have made every effort to
create    a   program   which   is
reliable,  it  is provided "AS IS"
and   without   warranties  as  to
performance,   or  fitness  for  a
particular purpose.

This   software   can   be  freely
distributed without license or fee
as  long  as  it is distributed in
its entirety.

Using This SoftWare
-------------------

The main menu includes:

	o Enter Transactions
	o Setup
	o Prepare Budget
	o Print Reports (not yet)
	o Help (you got it)

Each  of  these options will bring
up  its  own  requester.   I  have
tried  to  make  the  interface as
logical as possible.  However, you
can always press the "Help" button
on  the Keyboard or click the Help
button  and I'll see what I can do
for you.

Don't  be  afraid  to play around.
Before  entering your own data you
have  nothing  to loose.  Besides,
you  can always choose not to save
the data when you quit.

The  nuts and bolts of the program
is  in  the  "Enter Transactions".
When  you  are ready to setup your
own data, select "Setup".
