Setup Requester
---------------
This   Requester  gives  you  easy
access  for  setting  up Accounts,
Expense   Categories,  and  Income
Categories.   Furthermore, you can
clear  all data or setup for a new
year.

"Accounts",  "Expense Categories",
and  "Income  Categories"  buttons
simply   bring   up   the  Account
Category  Editor for the specified
data.

Initialize All Data
-------------------
This   clears   all  data  to  the
builtin defaults.  You do not want
to  use  this  option  if you have
Account  or  Category  Names which
you want to use.

Initialize New Year
-------------------
This will delete Confirmed Entries
and   clear  Budget  Totals.   The
Non-Confirmed  entries will not be
included in the Budget Totals.
