Transaction Selector
--------------------
This   Requester   Allows  you  to
"Qualify"   the  transactions  you
will   see  in  Transaction  List.
Qualifying the transactions allows
you  to see only a select group of
existing transactions.

Account Field and Selector Button
---------------------------------
The  Account  Field  specifies the
existing  account you wish to view
or  edit  from.   Transactions can
only be edited from one account at
a time.  Click on the "Hour Glass"
next    to   "Account"   and   the
Account/Category    Editor    will
appear.    In   addition  to  your
normal    Accounts,   the   "Cash"
account will appear.  This Account
cannot be renamed or deleted.

Search Limits
-------------
The  remaining  values are "Search
Limits".   These  values  are used
while   searching   the   existing
transactions   in   the   selected
Account.   Once  you begin to edit
transaction,  you  can  create new
transactions  which  do qualify in
the Search Limits.

Category Field and Selector Button
----------------------------------
This  Field  allows  you  to  view
transaction   for   a   particular
Budget   Category   or   for   ALL
Categories.   Click  on  the "Hour
Glass"  next to "Category" and the
Account/   Category   Editor  will
appear.   This will display all of
your Expense and Income Categories
along  with  "ALL" and the special
"Transfer"  categories.   However,
you  will  only  be  able  to Add,
Rename,    and    Delete   Expense
Categories.

Selecting  ALL  will  allow you to
view    transactions    from   any
Category.

Payee Field
-----------
You  can  specify "ALL" which will
allow  you  to view any Payee.  By
specifying  any  other  name  will
restrict  Transaction which do not
contain  the  value  "within"  the
Payee's  name.   For  Example:   A
value   of   "thom"   will   match
"Thomas"       or      "Thompson".
Capitalization will not effect the
search.

Start and End Dates
-------------------
These   values  simply  state  the
transaction's  starting and ending
dates.

As  with  all dates in HomeBudget,
The  input style is flexible.  You
can    specify   "3/1",   "3 1",
"3 1 91",  "3 1 1990",  "Mar 1",
"march 1    91",    or    other
permutations  of  this kind.  If a
year  is not specified, it assumes
the  current year.  When you press
the Return Key, it will attempt to
figure  out what you have entered.
If it makes since, it will convert
it to the standard mm/dd/yy format
and advance the cursor to the next
field.   If  it  cannot  figure it
out, the cursor will remain in the
same field.

Confirmed Button
----------------
The   Confirmed   Button   toggles
between  "Y"  and  "N".  When "Y",
Confirmed   transactions  will  be
shown.   Otherwise,  they will bel
excluded from the list.

OK/Cancel
---------
Pressing the OK button advances to
the    Transaction    Edit   List.
Pressing  the Close button returns
you to the Main Panel.
