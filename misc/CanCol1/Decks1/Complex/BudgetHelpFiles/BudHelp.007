Account/Category Editor
-----------------------
This   Requester   allows  you  to
manage    both    Accounts,    and
Categories.   The  items appearing
in  the list will depend on if you
are   editing   Accounts,  Expense
Categories, or Income Categories.

The Edit List
-------------
Sometimes  built-in  entries, such
as  ALL,  will appear in the list.
You will not be able to RENAME, or
DELETE   these.    Sometimes  both
Income and Expense Categories will
appear.  (An Expense Category will
have  an  "E"  next  to  it and an
Income  Category  will have an "I"
to it).  When both appear, you can
only  ADD,  RENAME, and DELETE the
Expense Categories.

Selecting an Entry
------------------
Most  of  the  time  you will only
want to select an existing Account
or  Category.   You can do this by
DOUBLE-CLICKING      an     entry.
Clicking   OK   will   select  the
highlighted entry.

Edit Options
------------
ADD:   This will add a new Account
or  Category.   You  cannot add an
entry which is already in use.

RENAME:  This allows you to rename
the currently selected entry.  You
cannot  rename  it to a name which
is already in use.

DELETE:  This allows you to delete
the  selected  entry.   You cannot
delete  an  entry  which  has  any
transactions associated with it.

MOVE  UP:  This allows you to move
an  entry  up  in  the  list.  The
first  account in the list will be
the   default   account  for  your
transactions.   The  first Expense
Category   will   be  the  default
Category  for  expenses,  and  the
first  Income Category will be the
default for Deposits.

MOVE  DOWN:   This  allows  you to
move an entry down in the list.
