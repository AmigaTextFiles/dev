Edit Transaction Requester
--------------------------
This  Requester  allows you to ADD
new      and     EDIT     existing
transactions.

There    are    three   types   of
transactions:

	1) Deposits
	2) Transfers
	3) Expenses

The  Date  and  Check#  fields are
used    identically    with    all
transaction types.

DEPOSITS
--------
When  you  enter  "Deposit" in the
Payee  field,  you will be able to
select  from the Income Categories
in  the  Category field.  Clicking
on  the  magnify button will allow
you  to  use  the Account/Category
Editor.

TRANSFERS
---------
When you enter the name of another
Account  in  the  Payee field, the
transaction   will  default  to  a
Transfer.   There are two types of
Transfers:   Transfer to (Xfer To)
and Transfer From (Xfer From).

Xfer To means you are moving funds
from  the  current Edit Account to
the Account specified in the Payee
Field.

Xfer  From  means  you  are moving
funds  from  the Account specified
in  the Payee Field to the current
Edit Account.

Whenever  you  create  a  transfer
transaction,    a    corresponding
transaction   is  created  in  the
Account  specified  in  the  Payee
Field.   Should  you  Edit  either
transaction, the corresponding one
is changed.

Transfers do not change the Budget
figures.

EXPENSES
--------
If   the   Payee  field  does  not
contain  the  text "Deposit" or an
Account  name,  it  is an Expense.
If   you  choose,  you  can  still
expense   an  item  which  has  an
Account  Name  in  the Payee Field
and  it  will appear in the Budget
figures.
