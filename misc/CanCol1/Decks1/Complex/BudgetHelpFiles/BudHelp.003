Budget Requester

	This  requester  allows you to
review  and set the monthly budget
amounts  for  each of your Expense
and Income Categories.

	The selected Category is shown
in  the box in the lower left part
of  the  requester.   The Category
Type  (Expense or Income) is shown
above the selected Category Name.

	The   Left  and  Right  arrows
allow  you to step through each of
the  Categories.  In addition, you
can   use   the   Account/Category
Editor  to  select one.  Using the
Account/Category Editor allows you
to  Add  Delete and rename Expense
Categories.     Use    the   Setup
Requester     to     add    Income
Categories.

	There  is  a  field  for  each
month.   You  can  set  the values
individually,  or  quickly set all
to  using  the  "Set  All  Months"
button.

	To assist you, several columns
of relevant data is presented.

Actual
------
This   column   shows  the  Actual
monthly  totals  for  the selected
Category.   Of  course  this  only
includes  the transactions entered
for  the current year.  Should you
enter a transaction for a previous
year  (or  for  a  future year for
that   matter)   it  will  not  be
included in the Actual Totals.

Income
------
This   shows  the  total  Budgeted
Income  for  each month.  Whenever
you  change  an  Income Category's
Budgeted  amount,  this  total  is
adjusted.

Expense
-------
Like  the Income total, this shows
the  total Budged Expense for each
month.

Net Income
----------
This  shows  the  total  budgeted
difference   between   Income  and
Expense Categories for each month.
