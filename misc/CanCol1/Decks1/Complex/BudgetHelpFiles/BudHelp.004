Edit Transaction List

	This  Requester  allows you to
Add, Edit and Delete transactions.
It also allows you to reconcile an
account   with   a   statement  of
transactions.

Transaction List
----------------
	Depending on the Search Limits
from  the Transaction Selector and
the  existence of transactions for
the  selected  Account, you may or
may  not  have transactions in the
Transaction List.  In any case, as
you  add new transactions, entries
will be shown in this List.

	With  the  exception of "ADD",
the    "CONFIRM",    "EDIT",   and
"DELETE"  options apply to entries
appearing  in  the  List.   Double
Clicking  an  entry  automatically
Edits  it.   Both  the  "ADD"  and
"EDIT"  operations invoke the Edit
Transaction Requester.

CONFIRM
-------
	This    option   toggles   the
Confirmation    status    of   the
transaction.

Balance Fields
--------------
The "Balance", "Statement Balance"
and the "Confirmed Balance" fields
are  used  to  display the current
settings  of  these values, and to
allow  you  to change them.  These
values  reflect  all  transactions
for   the  Account.   The  DO  NOT
reflect ONLY the show transactions
or the balance up to and including
the selected transaction!

ShortCut Keys
-------------
They  correspond  to the four edit
buttons at the bottom.

	F1 - Add
	F2 - Confirm
	F3 - Edit
	F4 - Delete

	In addition the Up & Down keys
moves   highlight  cursor  in  the
transaction list up and down.
