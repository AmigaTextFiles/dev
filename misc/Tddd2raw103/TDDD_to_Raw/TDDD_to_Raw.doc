Introduction
************


 	This idea began some months ago, when I was at the Southern Party 3 
 and I  desperately needed a 3D editor to finish my demo. As I couldn't find
 any, I decided to write this program so in the future I could use Imagine's 
 editor to design the objects for my demos.

 	TDDD to Raw was completely written in assembly with Devpac 3.02.


What it does
************


	TDDD to Raw is an utility to convert IFF-TDDD files, as used by
 Imagine to store 3D objects, to a more suited format for demo makers, 3DRW. 
 	
	It enables you to scale the objects and makes various checks of the 
 integrity of that objects. It also sorts the points in the faces clock-wise
 automatically, for use in light source routines.

	  
What You Need
*************



	TDDD to Raw will run on any Amiga computer as long as it has
 Kickstart 2.0 or later. Reqtools is not needed, but TDDD to Raw uses
 it if present. Reqtools is Copyright by Nico François and Magnus 
 Holmgrem.



Using TDDD to Raw
*****************



	I have tried to keep the interface as simple as possible, so I think
 a brief description of the gadgets will be enough:

 Load:
		
		At first this will be the only active gadget. If you press 
 	it, a file requester will pop up, so you can choose the one you want 
 	to load.

 Objects panel:
		
		When you have loaded a file, this gadget will contain the 
 	list of the objects contained in it, arranged according to their 
 	hierarchy.
 	
 Name:

		If you select an object from the objects panel, its name 
 	will appear here.
 	
 Number of points:

		The number of points the selected object has.
 	
 Number of faces:

		The number of faces the selected object has.
 
 Maximum coordinate:

		This gadget will contain the absolute maximum coordinate 
 	of the points in the object. It will vary according to the value 
 	of the scale.
 	
 Scale:

		IFF-TDDD files store coordinates using 4 bytes, so the 
 	range of values goes from 2147483647 to -2147483648. 3DRW files 
 	only use 2 bytes for them, so an scale value must be applied.

		If you enter a positive value, all coordinates will be
	multiplicated by that value and the maximum coordinate will vary
	according to that.

		If you enter a negative value, all coordinates will be
	divided by that value and the maximum coordinate will also vary.

 Save:

		This gadget will only be activated when you have selected
 	an object and the maximum coordinate is lower than 32768, that is,
 	the maximum signed value that fits in two bytes.


 	
Messages
********



		This is an alphabetical list of the different messages TDDD 
 to Raw will show. They are not error messages, as they will be listed later.
	
 
 Are you sure you want to quit?:

		It will be appear when you have a file loaded and you click 
 	on the close gadget of the window. It you choose the cancel option,
 	you will not exit.
 
 File already exists:

		It will appear when you have chosen a name to save the file 
 	and another file already exists with the same name. If you press
 	replace, you will overwrite the previous file. If tou pick select,
 	you will be given the opportunity to choose a new name. If you
 	choose the cancel option, you will cancel the saving.

 Not an IFF file:

		The file you have loaded is not an IFF file, so no data will
 	be got from it.
 

 Not an IFF TDDD file:

		The file you have loaded is IFF but not of the TDDD type. No
 	data will be got from it.
 
 Object not found:

		The file you have selected could not be found. You may have
	mispelled the path or the name, or maybe it is locked by another 
	application.
 
 This object is fragmented:

		The object you are about to save is fragmented, that is, it 
 	is composed of some sub-objects. 
 	 
 This object only has points:

		The object you are about to save does not have faces, only
 	points.
 
 Wrong face detected:

		TDDD to Raw has detected a malformed face. You can kill it
 	or cancel the saving.
 
 
 
Error Messages
**************



	This is an alphabetical list of all the error messages along with a 
 short description for every of them.

 Default screen is too small:

		The screen where TDDD to Raw is trying to open its window 
 	in is too small. Use the Screenmode program to make the Workbench
 	screen bigger or any utility to change the default screen to another
 	one.

 Not enough chip memory for scroll buffer:

		TDDD to Raw could not allocate enough chip memory for the  
	buffer of the objects panel.

 Not enough memory for file:

		TDDD to Raw could not allocate enough memory for the buffer

 Not enough memory for file buffer:

		TDDD to Raw could not allocate enough memory for the buffer
 	to save the file from.

 Not enough memory for file name:

		TDDD to Raw could not allocate enough memory to store the
 	name of the file.
 
 Not enough memory for gadget list:

		TDDD to Raw could not allocate enough memory to create the 
 	list of gadgets of the objects panel.

 Not enough memory for sorting buffer:

		TDDD to Raw could not allocate enough memory for the buffer
 	to sort the points in the faces. You will be given the chance of
 	cancelling or saving the file without ordering it.

 Not enough memory to analyze file:

		TDDD to Raw was able to load the file but could not allocate
 	enough memory for the different buffers that are required to analyze 
 	the file.

 Unable to allocate FileInfoBlock:

		The program could not allocate the File Info Block to read

		The program could not create the first gadget required for
 	the gadtools.
