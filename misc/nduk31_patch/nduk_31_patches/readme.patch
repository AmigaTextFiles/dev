Transfer the plain ascii tutorial files into texinfo files
<########################################################>

I bought the 3.1 Amiga Developer Update and read some of the stuff
from the tutorials archive. Well, I do not like plain ascii files
very much and so I decided to convert some of them to TeXinfo format,
that can easily be converted into a dvi file using TeX or a hypertext
file (GNU infoview format, amigaguide format or html).

So I did convert the files by hand and ran them into diff. I'm not
sure if it is legal or not to distribute the diffs, as they seem to
contain parts of the original documentation, so use it at your own
risk. If these diff files should be illegal, please delete the archive.

Generating the texinfo version:
-------------------------------

You need patch (I got mine with gnu cc 2.63 distribution).

patch <original_file> patchfile

This will generate the texinfo file.

Original		Texinfo 	AmigaGuide 	dvi
