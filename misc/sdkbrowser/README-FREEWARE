About the SDK Browser:

Maintenance Updates:

o v2.1.2.0 - Fixed a bug in the FREEWARE version which resulted in causing
             AmiDock to quit/crash when the SDK Browser itself was quit.
             Bug reported by: "imagodespira (Thomas)" on amigaworld.net forum.

o v2.1.1.0 - Added exception code to find the "xenares.doc" file for the
             xena.resource library, which was expected to be named "xena.doc".
             Bug reported by: "Kamelito" on amiga.org forum.

New Features in v2.1.0.0:

o The SDK Browser is now updated to build under the latest AmigaOS SDK (53.30)
  for AmigaOS 4.1 FE, and any older style API calls (now deprecated under 4.1
  FE), have been updated to use their modern equivalents.

o All file scan and Grep Search functions within the SDK Browser have
  now been updated to use the newer AmigaDOS API calls, which support
  64-BIT filesystems. This means, not only faster file access, better
  memory management, but also full support for searching and reading
  files on very large drives.

o (STRUCT)ure browsing has now been added to the pre-parsed navigation lists,
  allowing for live browsing and quick look-ups on the hundreds of
  struct { ... } declarations found within the AmigaOS SDK include files.

  As with the displayed content from the other lists, you may be able to
  navigate to the definition of another struct just by double clicking on its
  name in the main display. For example, let's say you were looking for the
  definition of the "List" structure (from exec/lists.h).

 1.) Under the "SDK" tab you select "Structures" from the pull-down list. (you
     can also use ALT+TAB to make the "SDK" tab active (if needed) and press
     "5" or "CTRL + 5" to choose "Structures")

 2.) Now either scroll down, or start typing the first few letters in "List"
     until you are viewing the struct List { ... } definition.

 3.) Looking at struct List { ... } you see it contains references to the
     "Node" structure. To quickly examine the definition of the Node structure,
     simply double click on the word "Node" in any "struct Node ..." reference
     and it should jump right to it (under exec/nodes.h).

o User settable Fonts and displayed Tab lengths - The Fonts to be used in both
  the main Display and navigation Lists is now settable under the "View -> Set
  Fonts" menu. You can also quickly switch back to the system defaults font in
  the same menu as well. - The displayed Tab Length (for the main Display) is
  also settable under the "View -> Set Tab Size" menu. - Both of these new
  settings (and others) can be saved. (see"Enhanced user preference settings"
  below)

o Dynamic target screen selector - Under the "View" menu there are two
  selections for immediately moving the SDK Browser window to another target
  screen; "Use AVD Workbench", which will attempt to open/move to the main
  screen for AVD (if available), and "Move to public screen..." which will open
  a quick selection list of all currently open public screens, allowing you to
  pick one where the SDK Browser window should move to. You can of course still
  set the default screen to open on using the PUBSCREEN tooltype (see below).

o Mouse Wheel Variable Acceleration Mode This new dynamic accelerator for
  Mouse Wheel events allows for much faster movement through either the active
  list or body of text being displayed in the main window. It works by watching
  how fast *you* move the scroll wheel on the mouse, and accelerates or
  decelerates the amount of the display that is scrolled with every "step" in
  the wheel based on how quickly or slowly you move the mouse wheel.

  Normal mouse wheel movements only scroll one line of the display for every
  "step" of the wheel, no matter how quickly you move the wheel. However, when
  "Mouse Wheel Acceleration" mode is on (default), one "step" of the wheel may
  move half-way down a page of text in a single go. The effect builds the
  longer you continue to move the mouse wheel at the same or quicker rate,
  and slows back down as you slow down the movement of the scroll wheel.

  So for example, if you are viewing about a six page document, say about 250
  lines, under normal mouse wheel mode, it would take around 26 "rolls" of the
  mouse wheel to reach the last page of the file. However, under the new Mouse
  Wheel Acceleration mode, you could reach the last page of the document in as
  little as 2 or 3 *quick* rolls of the mouse wheel.

  Just try it out on a few different sized file views, and then turn off the
  accelerator by unchecking the "Enable Mouse Wheel Acceleration" menu option
  under "View -> Enable Mouse Wheel Acceleration" to see the difference.

  The goal of this mode is to give you the "best of both worlds"; single,
  controlled steps of movement when you need to carefully read through a
  section, and much faster "quick scan movement" when you want it.

o Enhanced user preference settings. The following user settings will now be
  saved to ENVARC:BITbyBIT/AVD/ and restored the next time the program is
  loaded, (whenever you select the "SDK BROWSER -> Save Settings" menu option):
    - Target screen to open on; Workbench, selected Public screen or the
      AVD Workbench screen
    - Use System default or custom Font selections for both the navigation
      list and the main display - User settable Tab lengths (for the main
      display)
    - Mouse Wheel Variable Acceleration mode (Enabled/Disabled)
    - The SDK Browser's window position and size (both normal and Zoomed)
    - Pen value for the text color of the main display
    - Background Transparent mode (Enabled/Disabled) for the main display

o Two new Search Modes have been added:
  - "Find Files (in dir)" which allows you to select a starting directory path
     (say SYS:), and a file pattern (say "#?.xml"), and the SDK Browser will
     assemble a list of all files it finds in that path that match the file
     pattern.

  - "Search (in Search Results)" which allows you to perform further "grep"
     searches within every file listed in the current Search Results. When run
     all files in the Search Results list which do *not* contain the text you
     are looking for will be removed from the results list, leaving only the
     files which do contain a match for the text in question.

     This action can be performed as many times as you like as long as there
     is at least one item still left in the search results list. Using this
     feature can allow you to "filter down" within a set of results to find
     some specific text. Take the above example for "Find Files (in dir)" to
     build a list of all files with an .xml extension on the SYS: volume, then
     use "Search (in Search Results)" to further find just the .xml files which
     contain say, the text "<key>". Then when you select any of those entries
     in the Search Results list, it will open that file and jump to the first
     reference to that text ("<key>") that is finds.

     As with all other actions run from the "Search bar" these new search
     actions are performed as a separate process, allowing you to continue
     to browse to any other area of the software (even the Search Results as
     they come in), while the search is being performed.

o Two new "Open In.." options for locating the currently viewed file on the
  system have been added:
   - "Open in File Browser" sets the path to the current
      file in the "File Browser" tab of the SDK Browser itself.

   - "Open in Workbench window..." will open a window on the Workbench where
      the currently viewed file can be found.

o New application Icon donated by Martin "Mason" Merz (www.masonicons.info)
  -- Thanks Mason!

o Three new Tool Types have been added to allow for the remaining
  "Send File To" menu actions to be set externally, just like could already
   be done with "Editor" and "Web Browser". So the complete set of Tool Types
   for setting which programs are run for these actions are
   (shown with internal defaults):
     EDITOR     = SYS:Utilities/NotePad
     MULTIVIEW  = SYS:Utilities/MultiView
     WEBBROWSER = SYS:Internet/IBrowse/IBrowse
     PDFVIEWER  = SYS:Utilities/AmiPDF/AmiPDF
     UNARC      = SYS:Utilities/UnArc

   If none of this Tool Types are present when you launch the SDK Browser, then
   the above set of internal defaults are used. So, if for example you want to
   use the new MultiEdit and MultiViewer from A-EON's "Enhancer" package,
   simply set the EDITOR and MULTIVIEW Tool Types like this:

   EDITOR    = SYS:Utilities/MultiEdit/MultiEdit
   MULTIVIEW = SYS:Utilities/MultiViewer/MultiViewer

o A touch of Color - Two new menu actions have been added to allow some
  control of the background mode and text color of the main display area.
    - "View -> Set Display Color Pen..." menu action gives you the ability to
       set the text color of the Display Area to any Color Pen value (0 - 15).
       These represent using the system palette colors, as set with the
       preference tool SYS:Prefs/Palette.
       The default Color Pen is "1" (normally Black).

    - "View -> Set Background Transparent" menu action allows the user to
       enable or disable "Transparent" mode for the background color in the
       main Display Area (now on by default).

       This mode allow a possible background image texture to be displayed for
       the main text area, instead of rendering the solid background color. See
       SYS:Prefs/GUI, under the "Gadgets" Subsystem, General Tab -> Background
       texture.

       Please note that, unlike changes to the Color Pen value, changing the
       transparent background mode does not take effect on-the-fly. To see a
       change of this mode, first use "SDK BROWSER -> Save Settings", then
       "SDK BROWSER -> Quit SDK BROWSER", and run the program again. You will
       see a reminder of this in the status bar text at the bottom of the
       window, whenever this menu selection is made.

Features introduced in v1.6.0.0:

o Critical long standing bug fix, which would often leave a garbage character
  or two at the very end of a displayed file under AmigaOS4(tm) - Update 4 and
  would cause a complete system lock under the OS4 Beta, has been fixed.

o There were cases in v1.5.0.0 (and possibly earlier versions) where a public
  screen lock that was used to obtain information about the screen to open up
  on, was not being released. This would often cause Workbench screen changes
  (like with the ScreenMode prefs) to be blocked and unable to make live
  changes without rebooting and *not* running the SDK Browser. Happily,
  this too has been resolved.

o Some improved filtering was added to help prevent duplicate entries from
  being added to the History browser. In v1.5.0.0 a new History item was added
  to the list every time you selected an item from the listbrowser, even if you
  were just expanding a collapsed tree-view item (like a library or function).
  So if you clicked 20 times on the same item you would end up with a list of
  20 identical items in the History list. Now, in version 1.6.0.0 only one
  entry will be added to the end of the list for that displayed file, no matter
  how many times you may reselect it.

Features introduced in v1.5.0.0:

o Fully multitasking search bar with start/stop and pause/resume. File pattern
  filter added to search bar, and maintained separately for each search type.
  Interact with results as they are found, or continue to use all other parts
  of the SDK Browser as the search continues in the background. Search will
  continue even when hidden or iconified, and is controllable from the
  commodity exchange as well.

o New History Bar added. Quickly return to any of the last 20 items that have
  been viewed previously. Browse forward or back with the arrow buttons, or
  pull down and select a new position within the browser history. The history
  bar works like a combination of a web browser forward and back buttons and a
  rotating 20 item tabbed display. Giving you the flexibility to quickly work
  with the last 20 items that have been referenced already.

o Support for more than one interface(API) found within the same library.
  If the XML file for a given library contains more than one interface for
  accessing that library, then the SDK Browser will create a new browsable
  Library tree for each interface and name them with their respective
  interface name. This is also why the Interface name was added to each
  library entry under the Library list.

o Many new improvements too numerous to list here.

Some other features found in this release:

o Mouse-Wheel support using the new OS4 standard mouse-wheel events.
  Use Mouse-Wheel with qualifiers for even more browsing controls:
   Mouse-Wheel only = Vertical Scrolling(move up/down)
   Mouse-Wheel w/Shift = Horizontal Scrolling(shift left/right)
   Mouse-Wheel w/Alt = Vertical Scrolling(page up/page down)
   Mouse-Wheel w/Ctrl = Vertical Scrolling(home/end)

o AppWindow/AppIcon support: Drag-n-Drop text files onto the SDK Browser
  window or Icon for quick viewing.

o Faster than ever before using newly optimized viewing routines and
  less disk access.

o Quick find ANY item in the active list just by typing the first few
  letters of its name.

o "Includes" browsing. Live browse the system includes using the new embedded
   directory scanner.

o Convenient "Send File To" menu for launching a helpful set of external
  viewers right from the SDK Browser. Quickly open source files into the editor
  of your choice, or open HTML files directly into your web browser of choice.
  You can also launch the currently selected file with "MultiView", "AmiPDF",
  or even "Unarc" those archives.

o New keyboard controls to enhance the existing "mouse-over" focused movement
  keys and "mouse-wheel" support. (TAB rotates the main chooser under the
  SDK tab, while a-z "urgent" keys can be used for quick find indexing.
  Also "," "." "/" are now "Parent", "Enter", and "Root", respectively.)
  Alt+Tab now switches between "SDK" and "File Browser" tabs.
  Ctrl+Tab now rotates through the Search Types chooser.

o Programmable SDK Paths. You can now specify up to 10 XML Interface paths,
  10 AutoDoc paths, and 10 Include file search paths, as well as a default
  "Project" path.

o Programmable EDITOR and WEBBROWSER tooltypes (see below) for use by the
  "Send File To" menu.

Commands and Tooltypes:(Default Settings)
-----------------------------------------
CX_POPUP    = YES
CX_PRIORITY = 0
CX_POPKEY   = f1
PUBSCREEN   = <default public screen>
HIDEKEY     = esc
LEFT        = <Number of pixels from the LEFT Edge of the Screen>
TOP         = <Number of lines down from the TOP of the Screen>
WIDTH       = <WIDTH in pixels to open the window to>
HEIGHT      = <HEIGHT in lines to open the window to>
CENTERED    = <YES|NO> <-- This option overrides the LEFT and TOP values
                        (if specified)

You can set all of the "Send File To" external programs using:
EDITOR     = SYS:Utilities/MultiEdit/MultiEdit
MULTIVIEW  = SYS:Utilities/MultiViewer/MultiViewer
WEBBROWSER = SYS:Internet/IBrowse/IBrowse
PDFVIEWER  = SYS:Utilities/AmiPDF/AmiPDF
UNARC      = SYS:Utilities/UnArc

Each XML path listed below will be scanned for IDL (Interface Library
Descriptor) files and decoded to build the "Library" and "Commands" lists.
Do not override XML_PATH1 unless you know what you are doing.
(Default values are listed below as well)

XML_PATH1  = "SDK:Include/interfaces/"
XML_PATH2  = "SDK:Local/Documentation/MUI-3.9/xml/"
XML_PATH3  = <User specified path>
XML_PATH4  = <User specified path>
XML_PATH5  = <User specified path>
XML_PATH6  = <User specified path>
XML_PATH7  = <User specified path>
XML_PATH8  = <User specified path>
XML_PATH9  = <User specified path>
XML_PATH10 = <User specified path>

Each AutoDoc path listed below will be scanned in to build the "AutoDocs"
list. All files found under these paths will be added to the list as an
AutoDoc (this is so we do not filter out any normal text files like
"bootstrap.txt" or "rad.txt" that we actually want to keep).
Do not override AUTODOC_PATH1 unless you know what you are doing.
(Default values are listed below)

AUTODOC_PATH1  = "SDK:Documentation/AutoDocs/"
AUTODOC_PATH2  = "SDK:Local/Documentation/AutoDocs/"
AUTODOC_PATH3  = "SDK:Local/Documentation/MUI-3.9/AutoDocs/"
AUTODOC_PATH4  = <User specified path>
AUTODOC_PATH5  = <User specified path>
AUTODOC_PATH6  = <User specified path>
AUTODOC_PATH7  = <User specified path>
AUTODOC_PATH8  = <User specified path>
AUTODOC_PATH9  = <User specified path>
AUTODOC_PATH10 = <User specified path>

Each Include path listed here will be searched in order when The SDK Browser
needs to find a specific header file. The first two paths should only be
changed to the correct system header location (like if your SDK is not found
under SDK:). The first path also provides the "root" location for the
"Includes" directory scan lister. You are allowed to "parent" above it to
browse other areas of the SDK, and the "Root" button or keyboard "/" key will
provide an easy way to get back again.

INCLUDE_PATH1  = "SDK:Include/include_h/"
INCLUDE_PATH2  = "SDK:Include/netinclude/"
INCLUDE_PATH3  = "SDK:Local/common/include/"
INCLUDE_PATH4  = "SDK:newlib/include/"
INCLUDE_PATH5  = "SDK:Local/newlib/include/"
INCLUDE_PATH6  = "SDK:clib2/include/"
INCLUDE_PATH7  = "SDK:Local/clib2/include/"
INCLUDE_PATH8  = <User specified path>
INCLUDE_PATH9  = <User specified path>
INCLUDE_PATH10 = <User specified path>

The FILEBROWSER_PATH is the default path for the "File Browser" tab's
directory list. This is strictly for your own use, so set it to anywhere you
want. Like the first path of the "Includes", the path you specify here can be
returned to at any time using the "Root" button or "/" keyboard command. This
"root" location is reset every time you use the GetFile gadget under the
"Project" tab to select a new path location.

FILEBROWSER_PATH = SDK:

The next two tooltypes are used to specify what editor and web browser are to
be used by the "Send File To" menu. Make sure to use a full path here to your
program of choice. The full path and filename of the selected file is added
after the values defined below for each program. For example the default for
EDITOR is: "SYS:Utilities/NotePad <filename>".

EDITOR     = SYS:Utilities/NotePad
WEBBROWSER = SYS:Internet/IBrowse/IBrowse

* NOTE: If you programming for MUI for AmigaOS4(tm) and would like
        to live browse the MUI library using the SDK Browser, make
        sure the following Tooltypes are set in the SDK Browser icon
        (Assuming MUI is installed at SDK:MUI):

        XML_PATH2     = SDK:MUI/xml/
        AUTODOC_PATH3 = SDK:MUI/AutoDocs/MCC
        AUTODOC_PATH4 = SDK:MUI/AutoDocs/MUI
        INCLUDE_PATH8 = SDK:MUI/C/include/
