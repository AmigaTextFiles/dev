FDTools, V1.1

1. What is this ?

FDTools is a package of three small programs that handle .fd (shared
library description) files:

  - fd2i: FDFILE/A,IFILE/A

    fd2i converts a .fd file into an assembler include file (.i) containing
    the LVO values for the library.

  - fd2stub: FDFILE/A,STUBFILE/A

    fd2stub creates an assembler (.a) file containing the LVOs and stub
    function calls - including stubs for easy varargs usage.

  - fd2pragma: FDFILE/A,INCFILE/A

    fd2pragma is a replacement for the SAS/C utility fd2pragma. My fd2pragma
    is able to generate #pragma tagcall statements correctly !

2. Varargs detection

The .fd tools are able to detect functions with varargs (e.g. taglists)
if they follow the naming convention:

  - Function names of the form xxxA() (exceptions: Cache(Pre|Post)DMA()) and 
    yyyTagList() indicate varargs.

  - The respective stubs/tagcalls are xxx() and yyyTags().

  - In addition to that yyyTagList() has a (non varargs) alias yyy()
    (exceptions: Open(Window|Screen)TagList).

  - Any function whose last parameter is called "taglist" or "tags" but
    whose name does not end with "A" or "TagList" is handled like a 
    yyyTagList() type funtion.

  - The functions VFWritef, VFPrintf and VPrintf have varargs stubs without
    the leading "V".

3. Legal stuff

FDTools is freeware. There is *absolutely no warranty*.
