        SocketServer.class is a customized version of its superclass,
        Socket.class.  By using this class or its derivatives you can very
        easily build your own server.  Its only purpose is accept incoming
        connections and spawn new objects which take care of communicating
        with remote peer.  The class itself doesn't communicate with
        connecting clients in any way and you must supply a pointer to your
        socket subclass that is responsible to communicate with clients.

SocketServer.class/ESA_Server_Backlog  SocketServer.class/ESA_Server_Backlog

   NAME
        ESA_Server_Backlog -- (V1 ) [IS.], LONG

   FUNCTION
        Defines the maximum length of the queue for new connections.  When
        the client connects to server it is added to queue waiting for an
        accept() call.  If the server is busy this queue starts grow until
        the maximum number of pending connections is reached.  When the queue
        is full the connecting client receives an error ECONNREFUSED.  The
        queue is decreased by one on accept() and freed completely on
        ESM_Socket_Close.  The class calls accept() automatically for you as
        soon as possible unless you have overridden ESM_Socket_EventAccept
        method.

SocketServer.class/ESA_Server_SocketClassPtr

   NAME
        ESA_Server_SocketClassPtr -- (V1 ) [IS.], *IClass

   FUNCTION
        Pointer to subclass handling communication with a connecting client.
        When ever the class accepts pending connection it spawns new object
        using this pointer as its base class.  You *MUST* supply this tag
        with your own subclass pointer or class fails to operate.

SocketServer.class/ESA_Server_SocketTags

   NAME
        ESA_Server_SocketTags -- (V1 ) [IS.], *TagItems

   FUNCTION
        Pointer to taglist containing tags for NewObject() call.  This tag is
        optional and can be used to supply tags for new object spawned by
        server class.

SocketServer.class/ESM_Socket_EventAccept

   NAME
        ESM_Socket_EventAccept (V1 ) [NOTIFY]

   SYNOPSIS
        Object NewObj = DoMethod(obj,ESM_Socket_EventAccept);
        [For use within custom classes only]

   FUNCTION
        Server class overrides this method with its own code.  Of course, you
        can override this method as well but usually it is not necessary.

   RESULT
        NewObj - new object created or NULL in case of error.

   NOTE
        Objects created by ESM_Socket_EventAccept in Server.class are
        disposed automatically when connection is closed.
