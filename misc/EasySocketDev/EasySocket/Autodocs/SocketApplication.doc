        SocketApplication.class masters Socket.class and its derivatives. It
        is responsible for calling event notifies, namely ESM_Socket_Event#?
        methods.

SocketApplication.class/ESA_Application_Child

   NAME
        ESA_Application_Child -- (V1 ) [IS.], *Object

   FUNCTION
        Add new member.  When the socket app object gets disposed all members
        are disposed recursively.  This way DisposeObject(SocketApp) is
        enough to delete the entire object tree.

   NOTES
        Do NOT add objects from hostile systems or you are quickly visited
        by the great guru. Only add objects created from Socket.class or its
        derivatives!

   BUGS
        Take great care when removing individual objects from an object tree.

SocketApplication.class/ESA_Application_ErrorString

   NAME
        ESA_Application_ErrorString -- (V1 ) [..G], LONG

   FUNCTION
        Convert primary error value to string. This tag takes an error number
        as first argument and replaces error num with an approriate error
        string.

   SEE ALSO
        Socket.class/ESM_Socket_Error

SocketApplication.class/ESA_Application_MaxSockets

   NAME
        ESA_Application_MaxSockets -- (V1 ) [I..], LONG

   FUNCTION
        Set maximum number of available sockets for this application.  When
        the maximum is reached then all subsequent ESM_Socket_Open calls will
        fail until one or more sockets are closed.

        Default is 64 sockets.

SocketApplication.class/ESA_Application_UserName

   NAME
        ESA_Application_UserName -- (V1 ) [..G], *STRPTR

   FUNCTION
        Returns pointer to user name.

SocketApplication.class/ESM_Application_AddEventHandler

   NAME ESM_Application_AddEventHandler (V1 )

   SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,ESM_Application_AddEventHandler,struct ES_EventHandler ehnode);

   FUNCTION
        Sometimes it becomes useful wait for certain signals but since
        classes can't deal with the main loop event handlers are introduced.

        You must fill out a event handler node and call
        ESM_Application_AddEventHandler with the structure as parameter.
        From now on your object will receive the specified method whenever
        one of the given signals arrives.

        You can add and remove event handler nodes any time as long as you
        know your application object.

   INPUTS
        ehnode - Pointer to an initialized ES_EventHandler structure:
                signals - signals you wish to be notified on.
                object  - fill in a pointer to your object.
                method  - method that you want to receive.
                flags   - always set to 0 for now.

   NOTES
        You must match each AddEventHandler with exactly one
        RemoveEventHandler method.

   SEE ALSO
        ESM_Application_RemoveEventHandler

SocketApplication.class/ESM_Application_AllocMem

   NAME
        ESM_Application_AllocMem (V1 )

   SYNOPSIS
        memoryBlock = DoMethod(obj,ESM_Application_AllocMem,ULONG byteSize);

   FUNCTION
        Allocate memory from private pool.  Memory is freed *automatically*
        when the app object gets disposed.

   INPUTS
        byteSize - the size of the desired block in bytes.

   RESULT
        memoryBlock - a pointer to the newly allocated memory block or NULL.

   NOTE
        In the future memory allocated by this method may be swapped out if
        virtual memory is present in system. This is just private memory for
        your own use.

SocketApplication.class/ESM_Application_FreeMem

   NAME
        ESM_Application_FreeMem (V1 )

   SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,ESM_Application_FreeMem,void *memoryBlock);

   FUNCTION
        Free memory allocated by ESM_Application_AllocMem.

   INPUTS
        memoryBlock - pointer to the memory block to free, or NULL.

SocketApplication.class/ESM_Application_GetSocketEvent

   NAME
        ESM_Application_GetSocketEvent (V1 )

   SYNOPSIS
        sigs = DoMethod(obj,ESM_Application_GetSocketEvent,ULONG oldsigs);

   FUNCTION
        Notify objects about new things that have happened recently. Call
        this method whenever one of signals arrived.

   INPUTS
        oldsigs - signals returned by Wait(). If you dont have any (i.e. you
                are executing event loop first time) just pass NULL.
                The class will then return signals it is interested in.

   EXAMPLE
        {
           ULONG socksigs, sigs = 0;

           while(!(sigs & SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C))
           {
              socksigs = DoMethod(socketapp,ESM_Application_GetSocketEvent,sigs);
              sigs = Wait(socksigs | SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C);
           }
        }

SocketApplication.class/ESM_Application_RemoveEventHandler

   NAME ESM_Application_RemoveEventHandler (V1 )

   SYNOPSIS
        DoMethod(obj,ESM_Application_RemoveEventHandler,struct ES_EventHandler ehnode);

   FUNCTION
        Remove an event handler.
