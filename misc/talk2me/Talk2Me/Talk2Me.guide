  Blitz Basic has the following commands for programming the voice:

    @{fg shine}SetVoice@{fg text} rate,pitch,mode,sex,volume
    @{fg shine}Speak@{fg text} text$
    @{fg shine}Translate$@{fg text}(text$)
    @{fg shine}PhoneticSpeak@{fg text}(translated$)

  @{fg shine}SetVoice@{fg text}
  This is used for the V36 settings only, and will work with either
  version of the translator.library/narrator.device.

  @{fg shine}Speak@{fg text}
  Will speak the sentence in text$.

  @{fg shine}Translate$@{fg text}
  Will send text$ to the translator.library, and return the phonetic
  version that can be passed to the narrator.device.

  @{fg shine}PhoneticSpeak@{fg text}
  Will send the translated, phonetic$ to the narrator.device.

  If you want to access the V37 features of Amiga speech, you need to
  first create a NewType as follows:

    @{fg shine}NEWTYPE@{fg text}.newvoice

     flags.b        ; 1 to access these features or 0 to ignore them
     F0enthusiasm.b ; pitch difference 0 ~ 255  Default=32
     F0perturb.b    ; wurble in voice  0 ~ 255  Default=0
     F1adj.b        ; F1 pitch  (low)  +/- 100  Default=0
     F2adj.b        ; F2 pitch  (mid)  +/- 100  Default=0
     F3adj.b        ; F3 pitch  (hi)   +/- 100  Default=0
     A1adj.b        ; amplitude (low) -31 ~ 32  Default=0
     A2adj.b        ; amplitude (mid) -31 ~ 32  Default=0
     A3adj.b        ; amplitude (hi)  -31 ~ 32  Default=0
     articulate.b   ; emphasis         0 ~ 255  Default=100
     centralize.b   ; centralization   0 ~ 100  Default=0
     *centphon      ; must be  IY IH EH AE AA AH AO OW UH ER or UW
     AVbias.b       ; AV bias         -31 ~ 32  Default=0
     AFbias.b       ; AF bias         -31 ~ 32  Default=0
     priority.b     ; Priority while speaking   Default=100
     pad1.b         ; just for alignment

    @{fg shine}End NEWTYPE@{fg text}

  Note that these are UBYTEs, and that Talk2Me saves these values
  as words, as Blitz doesn't have a UBYTE - I know that you can
  use AND $FF to get the right value, but I had a reason for
  using words - you can still assign the values to bytes though.

  flags
  The narrator.device will only use the V36 features if this is set
  to 0.

  F0enthusiasm to articulate
  Effect the voice as can be tested with Talk2Me

  Centralize
  Defines how much effect, if any, the *centphon setting has on the
  way that the voice speaks

  *centphon
  should be a pointer to a string, and the string should contain one
  of the valid vowel sounds as shown above.  Talk2Me actually saves
  this value as a word, containing the index of the vowel, so it
  would be best to DIM a set of strings containing the vowel sounds,
  and then have a Centphon$ that gets set to one of them according
  to the index.

  AFbias/AVbias
  Effect the voice as shown with Talk2Me

  There are also other fields in the NewVoice type, but they cannot
  be accessed directly with the Blitz commands - one of the most
  useful of these would be the channelmask, and one that tells the
  narrator.device what to do if only certain channels are available.
  There is also a command to halt speech and flush the buffer, but
  again, this cannot be accessed with the Blitz commands.

  In order to alter the V37 settings, you need to have a pointer, of
  the NewVoice type which points to the VoiceLoc, and you can achieve
  this as follows:

    *nar.newvoice=VoiceLoc

  You can now alter the values in the newvoice structure - this sets
  them to the default values.

    *nar\flags=1
    *nar\F0enthusiasm=32
    *nar\F0perturb=0
    *nar\F1adj=0
    *nar\F2adj=0
    *nar\F3adj=0
    *nar\A1adj=0
    *nar\A2adj=0
    *nar\A3adj=0
    *nar\articulate=100
    *nar\centralize=0
    *nar\centphon=&centphon$    ;the address of the string
                                ;containing the vowel sound.
    *nar\AVbias=0
    *nar\AFbias=0

  I think that's everything you need to know.

  Thanks to Curt Esser for the example source code on accessing the

  reminding me of the PhoneticSpeak command, enabling me to include
  the 'Manual' option.

  Thanks to Anton Reinauer for testing the program for me.

@node Notes
@title "TALK2ME v1.21"

  @{fg shine}"NOTES"@{fg text}

  1 The program should detect whether it is running on a PAL or NTSC
    Amiga, and adjust the size of the 'sentences listview' accordingly.
    More sentences are displayed on a PAL system, natch.  Also, the
    Delete Phrase gadget is next to the Search-string gadget on an
    NTSC machine, but is at the bottom on a PAL screen, so NTSC users
    should take care not to press it by mistake.

  2 If you don't have V37+ of the translator.library, then the V37
    gadgets will be disabled.  If you don't have any version of the
    translator.library, the program will probably crash - I've tried
    everything I can to avoid this, but to no avail.  OpenLibrary
    works perfectly in telling me whether it's opened V36 or V37, but
    it crashes whenever I temporarily rename the library.  So make
    sure you've got a version of the translator.library, and the
    narrator.device.

  3 The V36 default settings are of my own choosing, and are the same
    as those that I used for Mr. Wolf (cheeky speaking-clock).  The
    V37 default settings are the 'actual' default settings.  If no
    voices are loaded, then anything spoken, will be with these
    settings.

  4 I cannot access the #CMD_FLUSH command in the narrator.device, so
    there is no way within the program to halt speech - this is why there
    is a checkbox to switch on/off automatic-speech.  This checkmark will
    be disabled if the RATE for a voice is set below 160 - as this affects
    'spoken words per minute' - and it can take a long time to speak some
    sentences.  You can re-check auto while the rate is below 160, if you
    wish.

  5 There are no keyboard-shortcuts for the Menu.  This is because I
    consider that the 'sentence' string gadgets should be activated at all
    times, as this allows for quickly editing and trying new versions of
    a sentence, in order to get it sounding right - unfortunately, this
    means that any attempts to use keyboard-shortcuts for loading/quitting
    etc, would simply be read by the string gadget.  This is one reason for
    adding a pop-up menu.

  6 The ".voices" suffix will be added to any 'voice' files that you save,
    unless the filename already ends this way.

    The ".phrases" suffix will be added to any 'phrase' files that you
    save, unless the filename already ends this way.

    There should be an example file with this archive called

      example.phrases

    The example.phrases file gives you some clues as to how to get
    sentences stressed in the way you want.  Just load the file, and
    then click on each sentence to hear it spoken in the default voice.

  7 In order to hear any changes that you might make to the translated
    sentence - make sure that MODE is set to MANUAL.

  8 Translated sentences that are sent direct to the narrator.device
    MUST end with a space, followed by a null character (0).  DO NOT
    delete the space at the end of the translated strings.  When these
    sentences are saved as .phrases, the space and null character are
    also saved, but if you export them as data statements, then they
    are deleted, as the null character will not appear in the data
    statements, and it is assumed that you will add these characters
    before sending the sentence to the narrator.device.  If you are
    not using the MANUAL option in you program, then you don't need
    to worry about this.

  9 Contact me if you have any problems/suggestions, as this guide
    assumes a certain amount of knowledge about Amiga speech.
    e-mail me: zalda@home4968.freeserve.co.uk

 10 WARNING: I sometimes get crashes if I put a 0 in the last word in
    a sentence.

@node Tips
@title "TALK2ME v1.21"

  @{fg shine}"TIPS"@{fg text}

  Since I added the 'Manual' option, these tips are of slightly less
  value, however, I still think that it is best to get the 'human'
  version of the sentence sounding as good as possible, before
  altering the 'translated' phrase directly.  When you do alter the
  translated phrase, you can put the digits 0-9 after any vowel sounds
  to state how they should be stressed, 0 being low, and 9 being high.
  The translation will probably already have some digits in it, which
  you can change, but you can also add digits after any vowel sounds
  that don't currently have one.

  So, "Hello." would be translated as

    /HEH4LOW.

  and you can change the 4 to another number or delete it, and you can
  add a digit afer OW - so

    /HEH4LOW7.

  sounds much better, as the OW sound is elongated.  Though please note
  that translations have a space at the end of them, which you should NOT
  delete - the program then adds a null character before sending it to
  the narrator.

  Also note that your input is not checked, and that I sometimes get
  crashes if I put a 0 in the last word in a translated string, though
  using 0s seems pretty pointless anyway.

  You can load the example.phrases into Talk2Me, to see ways of achieving
  various types of inflection.  Some sentences have a few versions in
  order to show you how to stress particular words in particular ways.

  You should consider that listening to the voices whilst looking at a
  screen full of information about the voice's settings, is completely
  different to listening to the voices whilst watching (for example)
  an animated character in a point 'n' click adventure.  Your disbelief
  isn't suspended whilst looking at a bunch of slider gadgets, but it
  might be whilst watching GuyBrush Threepwood.  If you can - visualize
  the voice's intended purpose - and then click on 'Speak'.

  @{fg shine}"()"@{fg text}
  You can use brackets around words to make them stand out from the rest
  of the sentence.

  Another feature of brackets is the following:

    (that) is the kweh-stion.

    that - is the kweh-stion.

  although the word 'that' is spoken exactly the same way, in both
  instances, the word 'question' is spoken differently.  You usually
  discover thise things by accident.

  @{fg shine}"-"@{fg text}
  You can use hyphens, either: to join words together, like-so; or to
  put a longer pause betwen them, like - so.

  You can also use them to stress a particular word in a sentence, in
  order to change it's overall meaning.  The general rule is, the first
  word in a string joined together with hypens, will be stressed:

    I am-a-speaking-clock.

  will stress the word 'am', make the sentence sound like an assertion,
  whereas

    I am a speaking-clock.

  would stress the word 'speaking,' making the sentence sound like an
  explanation of the clock's distinctive feature.

  @{fg shine}", ."@{fg text}
  The comma and full stop can be used to affect the way that a word
  is stressed.  The comma will generally make the word before it,
  RISE, and the full-stop will generally make it FALL.  You can also
  achieve a different sound on the last word, by NOT putting a comma
  OR a full-stop.

    tick, tock. tick, tock.

  would be intoned correctly.

  You can also, sometimes, dramatically affect the way that words are
  spoken, by ending a sentence with a longer version of the last word:

    don't u point @ me.
    don't u point @ meeee.

  would sound very different.

  @{fg shine}"numbers"@{fg text}
  Sentences can also sound different if numbers are used in place of
  words:

    out rai-juss-4-chune.

  sounds different to,

    out rai-juss-for-chune.

  @{fg shine}"letters"@{fg text}
  The same applies for letters that sound like words, such as:

    b c i j o p q r t u y.

  @{fg shine}"Concatenation"@{fg text}
  Sometimes, you can put two or more words together, to get them
  spoken more quickly,

    can'tcatch

  however, this won't always work, as some words end/begin with
  vowels, which will alter the sound when put together.

  @{fg shine}"mis-spelling"@{fg text}
  It is often best to deliberately mispell words in order to get them
  pronounced properly,

    kweh-stion

  So if you are doing a Monkey Island type game, you might need two
  versions of the data - one for displaying on screen, and one for
  speaking.

  in these menus depends upon where the mouse is when you press it -
  the top-half of the screen is for the voices, and the bottom half is
  for the sentences.  This means that if you want to Load/Save voices,
  then you should have the mouse in the top half of the screen when

  @{fg shine}EXPORTING@{fg text}

  You can save the files as ready-made data statements.  All currently
  loaded voices and sentences will be included in the output, so if you
  only want to export the voices, or the phrases, simply "New" the ones
  that you don't want exporting.

  When you choose "Export" from the menu, a window will appear with a
  number of checkboxes, and a GTMX gadget (radio buttons) in it.

  The checkboxes represent the features of Amiga speech, and you can
  disable/enable them according to which features you will be using in
  your program.  That way, the data statements will only contain the
  information that you require.  The first column of checkboxes are for
  the V36 features, and you are most likely to not want the "volume"
  setting saving.  The second column contains the V37 stuff.  If you don't
  have V37 of the tranlator. library, then the second column will not appear.

  The GTMX gadget enables you to choose whether you want to export just
  the human versions of the sentences; just the translated versions; or
  both versions.

  Disable/enable as required, and then click on "Export" or "Cancel," at
  which point, a file-requester will appear.

  A rough guide to this file-format is:

  --------------START--------------
  ;reminder of settings saved
  data.b # of voices
  ;voicename
  data.w setting,setting,setting...
  ;voicename
  data.w setting,setting,setting...
  ;etc
  data.w etc,etc,etc...


  data.b # of phrases
  data$ "human phrase 1"
  data$ "translated phrase 1"
  data$ "etc..."
  ---------------END---------------

  You can now, simply load this file into an editor.  See @{"File-formats" link Files}
  for more detailed information on Exported files.  This will also tell
  you the structure of .voice and .phrase files, in case you don't want
  to use data statements in your program.

  NOTE: you may need to change the 'type' for the '# of voices' and
        '# of phrases' from bytes to words in your main program, if you
        concatenate the files, or you'll get an overflow.

  NOTE: If you are using this in conjunction with Blitz-Basic, then TED
        will only allow upto 128 characters on a line, so bear this in
        mind when creating sentences.  The maximum length of a human
        sentence in Talk2Me is 100 - but the maximum for the translated
        version is 200 (to be on the safe side).

  NOTE: The narrator.device expects any translated strings passed to it
        to end with a space, followed by a chr$(0) (null character).
        When the sentences are exported, the two characters are deleted
        from the end of the sentence, as the null character will not
        appear in the Blitz Basic text editor, and the same is probably
        true for any other language.  So if you are using data statements
        of the translated strings, you'll need to create a string that is

         " "+chr$(0)

        and then add this to the sentences when you READ them from the
        data statements.

  @{fg shine}V36 Settings@{fg text}

  To the right of the voices listview, in the centre of the screen, are
  the gadgets related to the V36 settings.

  Prior to V37, the only settings that you could alter for the voice
  were:

  @{fg shine}Rate@{fg text}        Words spoken per minute - 40-400.
  @{fg shine}Pitch@{fg text}       Pitch in hz - 65-350.
  @{fg shine}Volume@{fg text}      0-64
  @{fg shine}Mode@{fg text}        Natural, Robot, Manual (see below)
  @{fg shine}Sex@{fg text}         Male, Female
  @{fg shine}Frequency@{fg text}   5000-28000 a beep will be sounded if you try
              to enter an invalid amount

  MANUAL (Mode above)
  This option enables you to directly alter the translated version of
  your sentence.  You can put the digits 0-9 after any vowel sounds,
  to state 'manually' how much stress should be placed on them - 0 being
  the lowest, and 9 the highest.

  So, "Hello." would be translated as

    /HEH4LOW.

  and you can change the 4 to another number or delete it, and you can
  add a digit afer OW - so

    /HEH4LOW7.

  sounds much better, as the OW sound is elongated.

  Please note that I got crashes when putting a 0 in the last word in a
  sentence, but this was for testing purposes, and I can see no point in
  using 0s anyway.  There is no way that the program can check the
  validity of your entries, so be careful.

  If there is a checkmark in the "Auto" checkbox, and there is a sentence
  in the string gadget, then the sentence will be spoken automatically
  when you let go of one of the above gadgets.  N.B. but if you lower the
  RATE to below 160, then the checkbox will become disabled, as it can take
  a long time to speak sentences with a low RATE, and there is presently
  no way I can flush the speech buffer from Blitz Basic.

  NOTE: When a 'Human' sentence is translated, the translated string has
  a space, and a null (0) character at the end.  The null character will
  not appear in the string gadget, but the space will.  DO NOT delete the
  space at the end of the translated sentence.

  @{fg shine}V37 Settings@{fg text}

  If you don't have V37 of the translator.library, then the following
  gadgets will be disabled.

  To the far right, at the top of the screen, are the V37 gadgets, they
  are

  @{fg shine}Enthusiasm@{fg text}           Fun, fun, fun!
  @{fg shine}Perturb@{fg text}              Even more fun!

  @{fg shine}Frequency Adjust 1@{fg text}   Although you can adjust these, their
  @{fg shine}Frequency Adjust 2@{fg text}   usefulness seems dubious - my attempts
  @{fg shine}Frequency Adjust 3@{fg text}   made the speakers buzz - but that may
                       have been because I was using such
  @{fg shine}Amplitude Adjust 1@{fg text}   a high frequency setting in the V36
  @{fg shine}Amplitude Adjust 2@{fg text}   gadgets - and changing the voice to
  @{fg shine}Amplitude Adjust 3@{fg text}   MALE helps as well.  You can get some
                       interesting sounds with negative values.

  @{fg shine}Articulation@{fg text}         Seems to affect how well the words are
                       spoken.

  @{fg shine}Centphon@{fg text}             If this is zero, then the radio-buttons
                       on the far right of the screen will have
                       no effect - otherwise, all words spoken
                       will 'centralize' from the vowel sounds
                       in the words, towards the selected vowel
                       sound in the radio buttons.  The best way
                       to understand, is to try a sentence with
                       Cent: on zero, and then on max.  Can make
                       voices sound like Melvyn Bragg, or
                       Inspector Clueseau - or like you're
                       pinching your nose with thumb and
                       forefinger, or you've got your mouth full.

  @{fg shine}AV bias@{fg text}              As with frequency and amplitude above
  @{fg shine}AF bias@{fg text}              tends to make my speakers buzz, but you
                       might discover a use for them.

  If there is a checkmark in the "Auto" checkbox, and there is a current
  sentence, then the sentence will be spoken automatically when you let
  go of one of the above gadgets - unless you click on a radio button
  when the "Cent:" slider is set to zero - as this turns off the radio
  buttons.  The sentence will be spoken in the current voice if there is
  one, otherwise in the default voice.

@node Phrases
@title "TALK2ME v1.21"

  @{fg shine}PHRASES@{fg text}

  @{fg shine}Creating@{fg text}
  There is a large list view, with the entry

    <new phrase>

  When you click on this, a new item will be added to the listview - if
  it is the first phrase, then it will be blank - if it is not the first,
  then it will copy the phrase from the currently highlighted listitem.

  There are two string gadgets above this listview: 'Human' and 'Trans'

  HUMAN: This is where you type your sentence in (it's called human, and
  not English, as this program could be used for other languages).  When
  your press [RETURN] in this gadget, it will be translated, and the
  translated version will be placed in the 'TRANS:' string gadget.  If
  the 'auto' checkbox is checked, then the sentence will be spoken.  The
  HUMAN string gadget will be enabled again, so that you can quickly edit
  sentences to get them sounding right.  The length of this string is now
  shown at the end of the string gadget.

  TRANS: Note: for this gadget to have any effect, you need to have the
  'Mode' cycle gadget set to 'Manual.'  You can edit the translated string,
  in order to get the exact stress that you want.  The digits 0-9 are placed
  after vowel sounds to state how they should be stressed - 0 being low
  stress, and 9 being high.  No checks are made as to the validity of your
  input, so make sure any digits you enter are after vowel sounds, like EH.
  The translated version will already have digits in, and you can safely
  alter these values, but you can also put digits after vowel sounds that
  don't presently have values after them.  When you press [RETURN], the
  sentence will be spoken in the current voice, or the default voice if
  there isn't a current voice.  The TRANS gadget will be enabled again, to
  allow you to quickly edit the translated string.  The length of this
  string is now shown at the end of the string gadget - please note that
  the length includes the trailing 'space' and a null character.

  Please be careful with your input into the Trans string gadget, as there
  is no way to check it for validity, and I got crashes if I put a 0 in
  the last word in a sentence - though this was for testing purposes, and
  there is no real reason to use 0s.

  The current phrase number will be shown in a text gadget to the right
  of the listview.

  If you want to copy a phrase (because you want to keep the current
  version, but want to try a few changes) you can click on the phrase
  that you want to copy, and then click on <new phrase> - the new
  phrase will contain the same sentence.

  @{fg shine}Translating@{fg text}
  There are 3 ways to get the current human sentence translated.

    1. press [RETURN] in the HUMAN string gadget.
    2. click the 'Translate' button.
    3. shift-delete everything in the TRANS string gadget,
       and then press [RETURN].

  @{fg shine}Loading@{fg text}
  To load previously saved phrases, move the mouse to the bottom half
  of the screen, press and hold the right mouse-button, and then
  choose 'Load Phrases' from the menu.  The file requester that appears
  will filter files that do not end with ".phrases".

  @{fg shine}Saving@{fg text}
  To save the phrases automatically to a previously loaded file, choose
  'Save Phrases' from the menu.  This will overwrite the old file without
  asking.

  To save the phrases to a new file, choose 'Save As Phrases' - this
  will always provide a file requester.

  NOTE: the screen's title bar will contain the names of the current
  filenames when files are saved or loaded.

  @{fg shine}Selecting@{fg text}
  To select a phrase as the current phrase, simply click on the phrase
  in the listview.  The sentence string gadget will now contain this
  phrase.

  If there is a checkmark in the "Auto" checkbox, then the newly-selected
  phrase will be spoken - in the current voice, if there is one, otherwise
  in the default voice.  This is to enable you to quickly test different
  sentences with the same voice.

  @{fg shine}Searching@{fg text}
  Type the 'search text' in the Search-Text string gadget - when you press
  return, the program will search the phrases (forwards from the current
  phrase) for any occurrence of the string.  If an occurrence is found,
  the 'search string' will be spoken, the relevant phrase will be high-
  lighted in the listview, and the phrase copied to the sentence gadget.
  If the 'search string' is not found, then the program will speak

    "I can't find it."

  To search again, after a 'successful find,' click on the '>' gadget to
  the right of the search string gadget, to find the next occurrence, if
  any.

  @{fg shine}Deleting@{fg text}
  To delete a phrase, highlight the sentence in the listview, and
  then click delete - there is no undo.  On a PAL machine, the delete
  button is at the bottom of the screen, but on an NTSC machine it is
  just below the Search-string gadget - so NTSC users should take care
  not to press it by mistake.

@node What
@title "TALK2ME v1.21"

  @{fg shine}What is it?@{fg text}

  Talk-2-Me is a GUI that allows you to set the rate, pitch, frequency,
  etc. of Amiga speech; try out sentences to see how they sound, save
  files containing upto 50 voices, and 100 phrases, and export files
  as text files containing data statements, for inclusion in your
  source code.

  @{fg shine}Why is it here?@{fg text}

  Amiga speech is much better than I first thought, and when I finished
  Mr. Wolf v3.0, I decided to put the experience to use, by writing this
  program to allow other people to mess about with the voice, and test
  out/save phrases.  Amiga speech is very underused, and I could think
  of a number of uses:

    A speaking-calculator that reads the digits/answers as you type them
    in - meaning you don't have to look at the screen.

    Internet games - where players can send phrases to other consoles.
    (Anton Reinauer - the BlitzList)

    Monkey Island-type games with speech - the voices can be made to
    sound very different, and it would be interesting to see a MI-clone
    that uses this feature for the characters in the game.

    OS games in general.

    I'm told it was used for WipEOut 2097!

  @{fg shine}FILE-FORMATS@{fg text}

  @{fg shine}Saved files@{fg text}

  The structure of a saved .voices file is as follows:

    Voices 1.5             ;the literal string - for error checking
    numvoices              ;number of different voices to follow
    ---start voices---     ;this line isn't in the saved file
    Name$                  ;this voice's name - upto 18 characters

    Amp3.w                 ;-31 - +32 - default=0
    Enthusiasm.w           ;0-255 - default=100

    AVbias.w               ;-31 - +32 - default=0
    AFbias.w               ;-31 - +32 - default=0
    ---next voice----      ;from 1 to numvoices (at line 2)
    ---..........----
    ---last voice----

  NOTE: this is the file structure, regardless of whether you have
  V37 of the translator.library.  Also note that Centphon is saved
  as a word, containing the number (from 0-10) of the 2-character
  string as shown above.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  The structure of a saved .phrases file is as follows:

    Phrases 1.2            ;the literal string - for error checking
    numphrases             ;number of phrases in data file
    HumanPhrase            ;a string upto 100 characters in length
                           ;so use Edit$(101) to read line feed.
    TranslatedPhrase       ;a string upto 200 characters in length
                           ;so use Edit$(201) to read line feed.
    --next phrase---       ;from 1 to numphrases
    --...........---
    --last phrase---

  The above is in case you want to be able to load the information
  into records or lists in your program.  However, if programming in
  Blitz, you should be aware that the newvoice structure requires
  BYTEs for the V37 settings - which I save as WORDs - this is because
  Blitz doesn't allow UBYTEs, and I wish to preserve the proper value
  in the saved file.

  You should also note that the translated phrases end with a space,
  followed by a null character (chr$(0)).  And I have been extremely
  cautious in allowing the translated phrase to be 200 characters in
  length, as the maximum human sentence is 100 characters, and a
  translation should never be more than about 150 - though certain
  characters, such as &, ^, % etc are greatly extended in their
  translated form.

  @{fg shine}Exported Files@{fg text}

  The structure of an exported file depends largely on the settings that
  you choose in the window that appears when you choose EXPORT from the
  menu.

  ;rem line with info about n1,n2,n3.... below
  Data.b numvoices                              ;to follow
  ;Name                                         ;first voice name
  Data.w n1,n2,n3....                           ;first settings
  ;Name                                         ;next voice name (if any)
  Data.w n1,n2,n3....                           ;next settings (if any)
  ;Name                                         ;for however many voices
  Data.w n1,n2,n3....                           ;there are.
                                                ;two bla
                                                ;       nk lines
  Data.b numphrases                             ;to follow
  Data$ "Human phrase"                          ;first sentence if chosen
  Data$ "Translated phrase"                     ;first translation if chosen
  Data$ "Human phrase"                          ;second sentence
  Data$ "Translated phrase"
  Data$ "Human phrase"                          ;to numphrases (if any)
  Data$ "Translated phrase"

  The ;Name part is for reference, but you could use it as a RESTORE
  label by replacing the ; with a . once you've loaded the file into
  your source code.

  The n1,n2,n3.... represent the values for which you entered checkmarks
  in the checkboxes to state which values you wished to be exported, i.e
  Rate, Pitch, Enthusiasm.  The exported file will contain a REMed line
  at the top to remind you which ones you chose, and what order they
  appear in.

  NOTE: you may need to change the 'type' for the '# of voices' and
        '# of phrases' from bytes to words in your main program, if you
        concatenate the files, or you'll get an overflow.

  NOTE: Once exported, these files can't be reloaded by Talk2Me.

  NOTE: In Blitz Basic, the maximum length of a line in the text editor
        is 128, so you will need to ensure that translated sentences are
        not longer than this (including the Data$ "), or the editor will
        insert a line-break in the data statement.
