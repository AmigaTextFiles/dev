For those that don't read guides (like me) a quick note about the
menu - I've given the program a pop-up menu, that appears when you press
and hold the RMB - however, you should note that what appears in this
menu depends upon where the mouse is.  If it is in the top half of the
screen, then the menu will relate to the voices, otherwise it will
relate to the sentences.
