Introduction
============

   Programmers sometimes want to look at an executable file to find out what
does it consist of. For this reason, many hunk structure analysers have been
written. It's another one!

   Exemine understands all (at lease I hope all) the hunk types supported by
Kickstart 3.0. It doesn't support hunks which cannot occur in loadable files
(e.g., symbol references in object files).

   Exemine is pure and can be made resident.

Requirements
============

   - Exemine requires Kickstart 2.04 or higher and the ss.library version 5.0 or
higher (included in this archive, see SSLib<???>.lha on the AmiNet for full
distribution).


Usage
=====

   Exemine <from> [SILENT] [DUMP]

<from> - executable files to be analysed

SILENT - show only the basic structure. Suppress relocation offsets and similar
         things.

  DUMP - dump contents of code and data hunks.
