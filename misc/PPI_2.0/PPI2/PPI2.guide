  Welcome to the Programming Project Interface Amigaguide file.

then please email me at:

  I do not give out my real address over the Internet, so if you
email me at that address and that account no longer exists
thenmail root at that machine and ask to have your mail forwarded.
There is no guarantee that it will get to me, but the chances are a
lot better than not bothering at all.

  Any comments and suggestions are welcome.

@NODE Introduction "Introduction"

  For some time I have been looking for a sort of control panel
that I could use for any programming language.  SAS has its own
editor and it interfaces to the compiler.  E has EDS, ESEE, and
E-Gui.  However, I wanted to use the same interface across the
board; for any language and any editor (which ruled out EDS and
ESEE).  At first E-Gui seemed like a good option, but its author
made it shareware.  Thus was born PPI (which is freeware).

  With PPI, you can do several things.  You can start a compiler
(any compiler), a text editor, and two other actions.  The actions
can be defined as you wish.  Personally, I use them to back up my
source and and use EFormat.


  For more usage details, see @{" Usage " Link Usage}.


  I wrote PPI2 in E (a VERY good language, thanks Wouter!) and the
source is also freeware.  However I do retain the rights to the
source.  Also, no modified version of PPI2 may be released. The
source is only for other E programmers to learn from.  Anyone who
decides they would like to give E a shot should mail me and I'll
help start you out.  You hardcore C programmers ought to look at it
too.  E does things C can't even dream of (e.g. expression
quoting).  On top of all this E compiles extremely fast (about 2
seconds for this program) and produces extremely (I like that word!
:)  tight code.

BTW - Yeah I DO like E!  Thanks for asking.

  Please read @{" Legalities " Link Legalities} for any questions about redistribution
and source code/binary usage.



@ENDNODE

@NODE Usage "Usage"

  To start PPI2 you can just click on the icon or invoke it from
the cli.  Nothing too fancy there!  :+)

  Once PPI2 is up and running you will see its interface which
consists of several buttons and some string gadgets.


  At this point, we'll break this down to some main areas:


  (From this point forward, I would have PPI2 running so this
makes sense.  The first time you run PPI2 the window may look
really small.  Just resize it to a comfortable width.)

@{" The Kill Extension Checkbox " Link The_Kill_Extension_Checkbox}
@{" Defaults File " Link Defaults_File}
@ENDNODE

@NODE The_'%s'_designator "The '%s' designator"

  At the bottom of the window you will see some text like this:

  Workfile: device:directory/filename

  This will be empty and only say 'Workfile: ' if this is the
first time you have run PPI2 and have not saved its preferences
before.

  This workfile can be changed by pressing the Pick Workfile button
with the mouse or by pressing 'p' while the window is active.  This
brings up the asl requester.

  The workfile is very important to using PPI.  In the string
gadgets you can specify the workfile name by using '%s' in place
of its filename.

  Example:
   In the Compiler string gadget you could have the following
   text:

     sc link %s

    If your workfile is sys:programming/project/whatever.c the
    command line that would be executed is:

     sc link sys:programming/project/whatever.c


  The '%s' designator can be used in any of the string gadgets.
Another example:

   In the Action 1 string gadget you could have the following
   text:

     copy %s t:backup-of-my-source

  The '%s' designator always represents the full path and
filename of your workfile.

NOTE:  You can make an action which looks like this:

     run >NIL: sys:apps/edit/turbotext %s

  In other words, you can detach a process completely from PPI
(otherwise it waits for you to quit) and you can redirect output
from the action.  This may seem obvious, but I just want to make
sure it's documented.

@ENDNODE

@NODE The_Kill_Extension_Checkbox "The Kill Extension Checkbox"

  Below the workfile text you will see a checkbox which says
'Kill Ext?'.  This is a switch which will remove the workfile's
filename extension before passing it to the compiler.  Some
compilers require this.

  Example:
    With '%s' = sys:dots.e and the checkbox on/checked and the
    compiler string = 'ec %s' hitting the compile button would
    pass the following command to ADos:

      ec dots

    If the checkbox were off/unchecked we would get:

      ec dots.e


@ENDNODE

@NODE Defaults_File "Defaults File"

  If you press the 'Save Default' button, PPI2 will save ALL of your
current strings, your checkbox state, and your window positions to
s:PPI2.prefs. PPI automatically tries to load this file in at
startup. This is a plain text file and may be manipulated with a
text editor if you wish.

  If you press the 'Save Local' button, PPI will save all the above
mentioned items to 'PPI2.prefs' in the directory from which PPI2
was launched.  This means you will have to have a copy of PPI2
(which is very small) in the directory in which you wish to have a
local PPI2.prefs file. This may be changed should there be demand
for it.

  PPI2 will try to load a local file first.  If there is none it
will go to the default file in s:.


@ENDNODE

@NODE Output "Output"

  For the most part, there is none!!!  However, you should note
that if your compiler (or any other command you invoke from PPI)
produces any output, the output will appear in a window which has a
close gadget for when you are through with it.  I suggest the use
of a tool such as KingCON to catch multiple compiler errors in a
buffer.



@ENDNODE

@NODE Legalities "Legalities"

  First off, you use this software at your own risk.  By running
this software, compiling any form of the source code, or reading
this text file you agree to the following terms:

  -  The author of PPI2 (Vincent Platt) is not responsible for
ANY negative effects you or your system suffer.

  -  The author of PPI2 is released from all liabilities
resulting from the use of PPI2 or its source code.

  -  Any modified version of the source code may not be released

  -  Any form of PPI2 may not be used for any commercial profit.
(Though a commercial developer may use PPI2 for his own purposes.)

  -  The source code of PPI2 is to be used for learning purposes
only.

  -  PPI2 may only be distributed in its original form through
public domain (read NON-PROFIT) channels which includes the
following files:

    PPI2.info
    PPI2/
       PPI2
       PPI2.info
       PPI2.guide
       PPI2.guide.info
       PPI2.e

  -  PPI2 may be distributed by Fred Fish.

  -  PPI2 may NOT be distributed through Genie, Compuserve, Tymnet,
Delphi, America Online or any other commercial service.  This is
because these are for-profit organizations.
