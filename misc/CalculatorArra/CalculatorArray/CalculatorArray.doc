ABOUT
Calculator Array is a simple floating point calculator. This calculator
comes with not only 1 calculator but two so that you can keep several
results visable when programming or writting reports. How can you view
the results of the calculator as you are working if the application has
it's own screen? I'm glad you asked! Well, this calculator(s) has the
ability to attach itself to any screen. Yes, any screen. Not only can
it do this but it is also semi programmable but more about this later.

DISTRIBUTION
This tool is Public Domain. Feel free to distribute it around. If you
wish to donate me some money (any amount) to help me upgrade my system
(I currently have an Amiga 500 with 1 Meg of memory and workbench 1.3)
then feel free to do so. My address is bellow.

REMEMBER: I have copyright therefor I will not allow anyone to sell this
tool for more than a price of a disk.

GUIDE
The rest of this manual discusses the use of the calulators features.
Fear not, however, as every option will be correct as I will test each
example as I go. Actually I have the calculator in front of me now and
I suggest that you do the same.

CALCULATOR MENU
Current screen.
  This option waits for a few seconds (10) allowing you to bring the
  required screen to the front then it brings the calculator to that
  screen. Try it now by hitting the menu item or the keyboard shortcut
  RAmiga-C then brind forward the workbench screen.


Select Screen.
  This menu option does a similar job to Current Screen except that it
  brings up a window with a list of screens to choose from. Select the
  screen you wish.

  If the screen you entered does not exist then the operation will
  fail.


REFRESH
  Unfortunately while entering this document I've discovered that the
  text editor that Blitz Basic tends to destroy the calulators window.
  This is probably due to blitz not using intuition routines. (Bummer).
  This option will refresh the windo for you.

BANKS MENU
Each evaluate menu item corresponds to a calculator position in the
array. For example the first execute belongs to the first (top) calculator.
While the fifth belongs to the fith calculator. The evaluator menu switches
off evaluation of the calculator. Why would you want to do that? Well, it
makes it poosible to use the bank as a template or a function.
The only thing needed is a way for one bank (calculator) to access another.
In fact, there is a way ! It is called the Bank command.

BankN Command
BankN is a five character command where N is a number from 1 to 9. Note the
number must be adjacent to the word bank or else the command will fail to
work. E.g. Bank1 * 5  will evaluate the contents of bank1 and multiply the
result by five.

Example 1.
For this example I will program the calculator to work out the percentage of
number. The first bank (bank1) will contain the value that we want to find
the percentage of while the sencond bank (bank2) will contain the percentage.
Bank3 will contain the equation. Finally, bank4 will execute everything.

bank1 <---  599
bank2 <---  10
Switch off evaluation of bank3
bank3 <---  BanK1 *bANk2/100
bank4 <---  bank3

Once you have hit return on bank3 the result 59.9 (10% of 559) will be displayed
in bank4.

EXAMPLE2

This example converts degrees to radians the finds the sine of the value
storing it in bank 4.

disable banks 2 and 3

bank1 <- 30                   Angle
bank2 <- bank1*Pi/180         Converts angle to radians
bank3 <- Sin(bank2)           Find the sine of an angle
bank4 <- bank3                Store the result here

result will be aproximately 0.5 (0.4999999 to be exact). Why isn't it 0.5
well it's due pi not being exact enough (the value is .00000006 out).

ERRORS
In the event of there being an error then the word Error will be displayed in the
appropriate bank.
The possible causes of errors are:
  Bad syntax
  recursive bank calls (causes infinite looping)
  Too complex an expression (Let me know if this ever happens)
  Unknown bank (if you leave out the bank number or have a space in between)
  division by zero
  log of a zero or negative number

Operators Available
*******************
  ()
  +
  -
  *
  /
  sin()      : argument is in radians
  cos()      : argument is in radians
  tan()      : argument is in radians
  arsin()
  arcos()
  artan()
  sinh()
  cosh()
  tanh()
  ln()       : Natural log
  log()      : log to the base 10

Constants.
**********

Currently only one.
  Pi

Next Release
************
  The following are being considered if there IS ENOUGH interest.

  saving of calculator to a file

  linking a bank to the evaluationof a bank and  all banks evaluated when one is
  evaluated so that when the value in bank1 of the example is changed the result
  in bank 4 automatically changes to the result of bank3 (assuming bank 4 is linked)
  to bank3)

  Note if there is interest I can get out the new release in a couble of days (Yes
  it is that easy to upgrade.)
WARNING
  do not destroy the screen that the calculator resides on. If you do the calculator
  will be lost!

BUGS
  Blitz Basic doesn't pick up errors properly for tan and log. I've managed to detect
  the errors myself for log but tan is harder i.e. error at (n*pi+1)/2 where n ranges
  from zero to infinity.

Comments
  This work is a part of a tutorial on how to use various aspect of blitz and is basically
  a spinoff from something that I'm working on.

  PS. Fan mail would be nice!  <:^>

Next Project Due
  Expert System   Date  August (It may be sooner!!!!)
