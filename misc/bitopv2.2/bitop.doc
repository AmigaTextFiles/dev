Bitop is a handy little tool for programmers. It's uses are:

    1. As a bit-mask tool. Create and edit bitmasks in decimal,
       hexadecimal, or binary.
       
    2. As a hex-dec-bin converter.
    
    3. As a simple calculator.

To use Bitop, run it from cli or WorkBench - I have it assigned to
the numeric ')' key in my text editor so it's always handy.
Bitop opens its own window.

The Title Bar: This will show the current operation that will be
performed on the numbers in the argument gadgets (if no number is
present in either of the argument gadgets, a '0' is assumed). The
possible operations are:

    AND - a bitwise AND
    OR  - a bitwise OR
    EOR - a bitwise exlusive OR
    ADD - addition
    SUB - subtraction
    MUL - multiplication
    DIV - division (division by 0 is undefined)

To cycle through the ops use the right-mouse-button (RMB).

The Argument Gadgets: These are the two string gadgets where you
enter the two arguments. The format can be:

    Decimal     - No prefix
           10     - ok
           1a     - wrong

    Hexadecimal - Prefixed with either the C-style '0x' or the asm '$'
           $F8    - ok 
           0xf8   - ok
           xf8    - wrong
    
    Binary      - Prefixed with '%'
           %10001 - ok
           %1a11  - wrong
           %1234  - wrong

    - All values are automatically converted to type 'signed long' (32-bit).

    - A 1's complement NOT will be done on numbers prefixed with '~'.
    
        ~100      --> -101
        ~0x64     --> 0xFFFFFF9B
        ~%1100100 --> %11111111111111111111111110011011

    - Any number prefixed with '-' will be negated (2's complement)
    
        -100      --> -100
        -0x64     --> 0xFFFFFF9C
        -%1100100 --> %11111111111111111111111110011100

    - Any number suffixed with '>>n' or '<<n' will be right/left shifted
      n times
      
        100<<1   --> 200
        100>>1   --> 50

    * NOTE: there should be no spaces between the pre/suffixes.

    Precedence: shift then not or neg then op.
    
        ~-$64<<1  --> $C7
                a) $64<<1   = $C8
                b) -$64<<1  = -$C8 = $FFFFFF38
                c) ~-$64<<1 = ~$FFFFFF38 = $C7

Results: They are printed in hex, dec, and bin.

Have fun,
