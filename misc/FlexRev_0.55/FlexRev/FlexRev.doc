Distribution:

  FlexRev is FREEWARE (Freely-Distributable), but copyrighted by me. (NOT PD) 
None of the included files may be modified and/or removed.  Permission is
given to freely distribute this program provided you include all files from
the original archive, and no fee is charged in excess of reasonable media
and mailing costs.  The program may not be used for commercial purposes
without written permission from the author.


Disclaimer:

  I cannot in any way be held responsible for anything this program does.
You are using it entirely at your own risk.  Every effort has been made to
keep this program bug free.  But, IF for example a bug exists that blows up
your entire computer, don't blame me.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:
  FlexRev is designed to be flexible.  It should be possible to use it with
almost any programming language.


Documentation:

TEMPLATE: FlexRev REVFILE/A,TARGET,PROTO,IR=INCREVISION/S,IV=INCVERSION/S,
                  DEBUG/S

    REVFILE/A      The filename of the REVISION file.
    TARGET         name of file to be produced (can be omitted)
    PROTO          name of the prototype (can be omitted)
    IR/S           Increase the revision number
    IV/S           Increase the version number
    DEBUG/S        debugging info. (i.e will confuse you)


The revfile:
------------
  Two keywords MUST be present: VERSION and REVISION.  You probably want to
include PROTO and TARGET, because then you can omit this from the command
line.  All other keywords will just be defined, but no processed.


The prototype:
--------------
  This file is a prototype of the output to be produced.  It is scanned for
${<keyword>} which is then replaced with the contents of this keyword.
To get the character '$' you must double it. ('$$' becomes '$' in the output)
The following keywords are defined by FlexRev:

  VERSION   - <versionnumber>
  VER       - <versionnumber>
  REVISION  - <revisionnumber>
  REV       - <revisionnumber>
  VERREV    - <version>.<revision>
  DATE      - <d.m.yy>
  TIME      - <hh:mm:ss>

You can also use the form ${n<keyword>}.  This will produce exactly n chars.
If <keyword> contains less than n chars it will be padded by spaces and if
<keyword> contains more than n chars it will be truncated.  'n' can several
digits if necessary.





EXAMPLE Revfile
--------------------

PROTO=revproto.h
TARGET=Main_rev.h
VERSION=0
REVISION=53
NAME=FlexRev
LOWERNAME=flexrev

--------------------


EXAMPLE protofile
----------------------------------------------

#define COMPILE_VERSION ${VERSION}
#define COMPILE_REVISION ${REVISION}
#define COMPILE_DATE "(${DATE})"
#define COMPILE_TIME "${TIME}"
#define PROGRAM_NAME "${NAME}"
#define PROGRAM_SHORTNAME "${LOWERNAME}"
#define PROGRAM_VER "${VERSION}.${REVISION}"

----------------------------------------------


The above will produce THIS:
----------------------------------------------

#define COMPILE_VERSION 0
#define COMPILE_REVISION 53
#define COMPILE_DATE "(13.7.95)"
#define COMPILE_TIME "22:17:23"
#define PROGRAM_NAME "FlexRev"
#define PROGRAM_SHORTNAME "flexrev"
#define PROGRAM_VER "0.53"

----------------------------------------------



System requirements:

  FlexRev should run on any system setup running OS2.04 or higher, although
it has only been tested on an A3000/25 running OS3.1.  If you find bugs or
have suggestions about how to make the program better please send a bugreport
and/or a list of suggestions to the address at the end of this text.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

History:

0.55 (26.7.95) tlr
  - Fixed minor bugs. Added prototypes.

0.54 (13.7.95) tlr
  - First working version. Is ok.


Todo:

- more special expressions like ${m<keyword>}
- better error reporting
