@node "Document_0" "Introducing the Programm"


                               Introduction


The TEX - ADocreader is a Databaseprogramm for Autodocs and Includes. You
also can show LVO's (Library Vector Offsets) of Librarys using the Help of
the FD Files.

The Programm is easy to use, flexible and you are even able to expand it the
way you want.

We wrote this Programm because other Software of this type didn't work
correctly, used to much Systemresources (MUI ?!) or they simply didn't give
us all the features we wanted to have.

We hopy you enjoy working with our nice Tool...

@node "Document_1" "Installation of ADocReader"

                             How to Install it

Simply copy the Programm and it's Icon into the Directory where you want to
have it. For Tooltype and CLI parameters please look under "Starting it"
@endnode

@node "Document_2" "What do i need (part 1)"

                             Needed Programms

To use ADocReader you should have the "ReqTools.library" from Nico Francois
/ Magnus Holmgren installed in your LIBS: drawer.  We used this Library,
because it simply has the best performance for a Requestertoolkit.
Furthermore, the ReqTools Kit is the wellmost spread und used one on the
Amiga.

If you don't have the ReqTools.library in your LIBS: drawer, then you can
Download the complete kit from local BBS Systems or directly from the Aminet
under UTIL/LIBS.
@endnode

@node "Document_3" "What do i need (part 2)"

                               Needed Files

Ofcourse you should already have a few Autodocs. Without them the
AutoDocReader is senseless. If you don't have some AutoDoc Files you can
simply download some in the AMINET under DEV/MISC or sometimes you can find
them beside some released Librarys. Some Programmers put their Autodocs also
in their Library Archives.

To get the full performance of the Reader you also should have the  System
Include- and Library FD Files. These Files are also included in Autodoc
Archives.


WARNING:

AUTODOCS IN HYPERTEXT FORMAT ARE *NOT* SUPPORTED BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
HORRIBLE SENSELESS.
@endnode

@node "Document_4" "Copyrights"

                      (C) COPYRIGHTS AND OTHER STUFF

    Systems.

    If you want to publish this Programm on a CD ROM, DISK or other Media
    for commercial purposes, you have to CONTACT US before an get the
    Permission.

6.) If you abuse one of those rules, we will get you to the court.
    And this is *NOT* a Joke.

7.) As Security for You and us, we added the filelength to the about
    requester. Currently it is 113792 Bytes.

@node "Document_5" "Freeware agreement and Registering"

                             FREE REGISTERING

To make some things clear. The Programm has no Limitations. You can use all
Functions without getting registered.

But you have a chance to get the Programm registered. You don't have to sign
something and you also don't have to obey special rules after you registered
your copy of ADocReader.

By registering this Programm you simply show us, that you like the Programm
and that you are using it. This is very important for us, because on this
way we can decide if UPDATING this programm is worth or senseless.

As a registered User, you also have the Chance to get the latest Versions of
the ADocReader via E-Mail from our MailDemon System.


To register for ADocreader you simply have to answer some questions:

@node "Document_7" "getting started"

                            GETTING IT STARTED

You can simply start it from the Workbench by clicking the Icon or you can
use it from CLI using some parameters.

After starting it, the Programm will get itself as a Commodity into the
Commodity Systembar and can be started/stopped using the "Exchange" from the
Amigas Workbench.

The Parameters of the Programm will be read out of the Tooltype. If you
start it from CLI you have to insert some ARGUMENTS.

Some ARGUMENTS are MOST IMPORTANT to get the thing started. They are
specially MARKED in this Documentation.



                  Starting it from the Amiga's Workbench

Options with a (!) MUST be used to run the programm:


ADPATH=<Path>

(!) The Path for the Programm to find the Autodocs


VIEWER=<PATH><NAME>

(!) Path and Name of your favourite textviewer. He should be able to accept
Filenames directly from the commandline.


INCPATH=<PFAD>

   Path to your Include Files



FDPATH=<PATH>

   Path to your FD Files


CX_POPUP=YESlNO

   This Option allows you to decide if the Autodocreader should
   Popup after Start, or to wait for the requested Hotkey.


CX_POPKEY=<HOTKEY DEFINITION>

   Using this Option will allow you to specify your Hotkey sequence
   which will open the AutoDocreader.
   The DEFAULT Hotkey is : Left Alt, Right Amiga and HELP

   Example. The Hotkey should be : Left Alt, Right Alt and D
   The correct line yould be then : CX_POPKEY=lalt ralt d

   Explanation of the seven qualifiers:

   lalt           - left alt key
   ralt           - right alt key
   lamiga         - left amiga key
   ramiga         - right amiga key
   lshift         - left shift key
   rshift         - right shift key
   ctrl           - ctrl key




PRECHECK

If you start the Programm from CLI using a ? in the commandline, it will
show nearly all parameters that you entered in the Tooltype. The only one
not showed is the CX_POPKEY. This definition stays the same, BUT it has to
stand between two " signs.

STRUCTS

Here you have to put in the path to the Structure.Offsets File, which is
included in the distribution of AutoDocReader from V2.0 upwards.

@endnode

@node "Document_8" "How do i use it..."

                                   USAGE

After starting the Programm you will see two Listview Gadgets and nine other
Gadgets. The Left Listview will show the List of your Autodocs using the
path you entered in the ToolType.

The second ListView will show the contents of your actual AutoDocs. If you
select an Entry, the output will be shown on your selected TextViewer.

you can use the Listviews via Mouse or simply by using the Cursorkeys. If
you have entrys in both ListViews, you can switch them by using the left and
right Cursorkeys.

The "Enter" Key selects an Entry.

There are two additional Infolines at the Top of the Window:

Autodocs(Anzahl): Shows the ammount of found AutoDocs. Path            :
Shows the actual Path you are using Doc             : Shows the active
Autodoc For             : Shows the additional Systemfile (Library, Device
...)

You can also steer the nine other Gadgets via your Keyboard by simply
entering the 1st Letter of the specific function.


Now following the description of the other Functions:

RELOAD:

This reloads the AutoDoc Listview if you changed the path or added new
AutoDoc Files to your Drawer. (Keyboard : r)



PATH:

Here you can change the path for the AutoDocs. the new Path will NOT be
saved and will remain active until you change the path again or quit the
Programm. If you restart the programm again, the defaultpath entered in the
Tooltype or commandline will be active again. (keyboard : p)



INCLUDE:

Using this Option you can show Includes. If you use this button, a ReqTools
Requester will open and ask you to select the Include to be shown. If you
entered a new Path before the requester will use this one. Otherwise he will
use the default, that you entered in the ToolType. (keyboard : i)



LVO:

Library Vector Offset. Just in case you entered a Path to the FD Files, you
will be able to see the Original text to specific Offsets or vise versa.

You have to enter the Offsets without a > - <, but you can use HEX, DEC, or
BIN 8:). The therefor used Presign has to be a ($ for HEX or % for BIN. You
don'tr have to use it for DEZ)

Example : 198 or $C6 will show all functions using this Offset from all
Librarys .

If you want to overhand a Functionsname, you have to introduce it with an
lvo.

Example : lvoallocmem would show this :
          exec_lib.fd

          AllocMem(byteSize,requirements)(d0/d1)
          DEC: -198 HEX: -$000000C6


(keyboard : l)

STRUCTS:

You can use this function for searching and viewing system structures.
Therefor the Structure.Offsets file was included to the archive.

The word you are looking for does not have to be complete. Even partial
inputs will be found if they are present.

CONVERTER:

Is a HEX,DEC,BIN Calculator. With it you are able to enter decimal values.
HEX or BIN values have to begin with $ for HEX or % for BIN.

(keyboard : c)



HIDE:

Closes the Window and lets the Reader wait for the predfined Hotkey or the
Exchangemessage.

(keyboard: h)



ABOUT:

Shows some Informations about the Programm.

(keyboard : a)



QUIT:

Quits the programm and removes it from Memory.

(keyboard : q)




you can "beam" the Programms interface by just pressing the Hotkey while you
are in antoher Screen. The programm will open it's GUI there. It always
opens on the Frontmost Screen.

@node "Document_9" "Trouble ?! Look here !"

                              Troubleshooting


P = Problem E = Explanation S = Solvage



P: If i start the AutoDocReader from Toolmanager, the Programm
   doesn't use the ToolType specific configuration.

E: Toolmanager is not able to emulate a real WB Start.

S: Write a Scriptfile that starts the Docreader with CLI arguments
   and add an Icon to it. Then simply install THAT Icon in Toolmanager.
   Don't forget to make the Script executable (Protect <script> s+)

This is the only Problem we know til now
