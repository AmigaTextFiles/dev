This source code requires the GMS developer archive available from Aminet
(dev/misc/gms_dev.lha).  Compilation of this module means that you have
read and agreed to the text in the DISTRIBUTION.TXT file.

NOTE:  There is a bug in SAS/C which occurs when using registers a0 and a1
together in a function.  This only happens when both registers are using a
pointer type, such as BYTE *, APTR or struct Object *.  So if you see such
definitions being replaced with LONGs and then being converted inside the
function, it is done specifically to prevent this bug.

To compile every part of the module with SAS/C:

  1> sc sound.c             <Compile>
  1> sc snd_data.c          <Compile data area>
  1> link.scr               <Link it>

To compile with DiceC:

  1> dcc -c -l0 -mD -mi snd_data.c -o snd_data.o
  1> dcc -c -l0 -mD -mi sound.c -o sound.o
  1> dlink snd_data.o sound.o tags.o cs.lib -o GMS:System/sound.mod

To compile everything at once using dice, just execute the compile.dcc
script.  The compile.sas script does the same for SAS/C.

If the dpkernel.library is resident after compilation (eg you have run
some demos beforehand) then you will need to do a "flush dpkernel.library"
so that the module will be reloaded the next time you run something.
