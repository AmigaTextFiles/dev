      <h1>
Istar - Knowledge Based System, and Knowledge Server
      </h1><!-- -->
Istar is a piece of software that allows you to distribute knowledge and 
perhaps wisdom.  (Name?  Gandalf was one of the <i>Istari</i>.)  It enables 
you to construct and then run knowledge bases (KBs), which are 
encapsulations of expert human knowledge.
      <p>
Have you arrived here from a link at the bottom of a page produced by the 
Istar knowledge server, or are you reading this as part of the Istar 
documentation?  If the latter, then read on through this page.  If you have 
arrived from a page sent by Istar and want to know what to do or what to 
expect, then you might wish to jump to the <a href= "#server">section on 
the server</a>, and read the rest at your leisure.  BUT FIRST, a tip: 
Before you read on, why not go back to the page you came from and <a href= 
"#set.timeout">set your TimeOut</a> to something longer than 10 minutes? 
So you'll have time to browse these pages in comfort.
      <p>


      <h3><a name="kg">
Knowledge - Its Types, Encapsulation and Use
      </a></h3><!-- -->

Since human knowledge has many aspects, including understanding and 
principles, experience and rules of thumb, precision and uncertainty, all 
in a complex network of interrelationships, knowledge based systems (KBS) 
technology has developed ways of encapsulating and handling such a rich 
mixture.  Because Istar is a 'visual knowledge representation language', it 
makes it especially easy for you to encapsulate knowledge and then make 
that knowledge available across the world via the internet.  There are two 
steps, involving people in two roles:
      <ul>
<a NAME="kg.engineer">
<li> You (or someone else) builds the knowledge base once.  (Actually 
usually an iterative process.)  This is the responsibility of what has 
become known 'in the trade' as a <i>knowledge engineer</i>.</a>
<a NAME="kg.user">
<li> Others (or you) run the knowledge base many times, applying the 
knowledge to many situations, to gain advice or clarification of ideas. 
When you do this you are a <i>knowledge user</i>.</a>  The KB can be run 
either:
      <ul>
<li> Using a WWW browser connecting to an Istar Knowledge Server, or
<li> On your local machine.
      </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
The rest of this page is written from the point of view of the knowledge 
user, such as someone who is running one of the KBs on the knowledge 
server.  If you are more interested in Istar itself (either general 
interest or as a knowledge engineer) then the <a href= "#istar">section 
below</a> takes you to copious documentation and allows you to download 
Istar.

      <h2><a name="server">
Accessing the Istar Knowledge Server
      </a></h2><!-- -->

<a href= "http://146.87.82.15:7007">To connect to the Istar Knowledge 
Server click here.</a>  <!-- was 146.87.133.70:7007, then 
huan.iti.salford.ac.uk:7007-->  (At present we have some problem with our 
old hardware, so this link might not be active.  Keep trying.  A.B.)
      <p>
The following will bring you to sections of the document describing the 
Istar Knowledge Server.

      <h3><a name="set.timeout">
Setting Your TimeOut
      </a></h3><!-- -->

If someone phones you and then leaves the phone and doesn't return, after a 
time you will hang up.  Istar does the same.  After a 'silence' from you of 
10 minutes it will assume you have finished and abandon your session.  But 
you can set this TimeOut Period to longer (or shorter) than 10 minutes if 
you wish, because you might wish to browse other pages during a session 
without fear of finding Istar has done this.
      <p>
To do this, look at the bottom of (almost) any page, and you will find a 
statement of what your TimeOut is set to and some wee hyperlinks ranging 
from 1 to 60 mintes.  Hit one of these, and your TimeOut Period will 
change.

      <h2><a name="istar">
Obtaining Istar to Build your own Knowledge Bases
      </a></h2><!-- -->

Istar aims to be both easy to use as well as powerful, in building 
knowledge bases.  It is continually under development and is (not yet) a 
commercial product, so you may download and use it free.  But it is, 
hopefully, as robust as any commercial product.
      <p>
(Most of the following concern version 1.092, which is the version 
immediately before the server module was added.  However, almost everything 
in that version and the server version are identical.)
      <ul>
<li> <a href= "docs/index.html" >Click here for an introduction to Istar 
and links to more information.</a>
<li> <a href= "Istar.lha" >Click here to download complete Istar suite</a> 
(530k) with program, docs and sample knowledge bases.
<li> <a href= "Istar" >Click here to download latest version of program 
only.</a>  (That is version 1.092; soon it will be the server version.)
<li> <a href= "kt/ktserver" >Click here to download the draft server 
version of Istar.</a>
      </ul>
      <p>
NOTE:  Istar itself runs on the <a href= "../../amiga/why.amiga.html" 
>Amiga</a> platform.  But, via its server module, its KBs can be accessed 
from any platform.
