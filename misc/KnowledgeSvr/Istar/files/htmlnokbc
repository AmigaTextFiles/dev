<body>
Sorry, but Istar cannot create the necessary data structures (<code>kbControl</code>)
for the knowledge base.  


<p>
This is probably because we are running out of memory.
This error should almost never happen, so we should be
grateful if you will 
<a href="mailto:webmaster@basden.u-net.com">email us
to let us know of this error</a>.
