Welcome.  You are connected to the Istar Knowledge Server 
demonstration site.  The Istar Knowledge Server allows you to run knowledge bases 
containing expert knowledge over the internet, using a simple browser.  
This site offers a few KBs of various kinds that demonstrate
different features and capabilities.  
	<p>
Please select one of
the KBs from the list below and you will be taken 
through an 'inference session' in which a sequence of questions 
is put to you.  Then results will be given, which you can explore
so as to interpret them more accurately to your situation.  
	<p>
<strong>DISCLAIMER: All the KBs, and the knowledge contained
within them, is used at your own risk, and WARNING: most of them
are still in development and placed here as demos of the potential
of the knowledge server concept.</strong>
