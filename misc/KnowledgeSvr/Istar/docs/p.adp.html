     <p>
<a NAME="default">
Click on a gadget and I will explain it.
</a>


<h3><a name="row.1">Row 1</a></h3>
<!-- -->

Row 1 identifies the attribute, with:
     <p>
     <ul>
<a NAME="label">
<li> Label.</a>  Leftmost in row 1 is the label (name) of the 
attribute, that will appear as text in the attribute box.
<p>
<a NAME="meaning">
<li> Meaning.</a>  The right half of row 1 is occupied by the 
meaning of the attribute, that will flash into the meaning bar 
at the top of the control screen when the mouse passes over 
this attribute.
<p>
     </ul>
<a NAME="wee.ok">
In addition, in the middle of row 1 is a wee OK button which 
acts exactly like the main one further down the panel.  It is 
here for your convenience for when you are merely filling in 
label and meaning and no other details.</a>

<h3><a name="row.2">Row 2</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<a NAME="domain">Leftmost in row 2 is the domain of the 
attribute, that is, what type of value it is.</a>  It has two 
parts: the main window in which the name of the domain is 
shown, and a wee button to hit with the mouse to alter the 
domain.
<p>
<a NAME="value">In the middle area of row 2 is the current 
value of the attribute.</a>  It might be just a checkbox as 
here, or a longer gadget such as a slider for bayesians or 
probabilities, a number for an integer or twin numbers as for a 
ratio.
<p>
<a NAME="val.extra">Over the right hand side of row 2 you 
sometimes get extra information about the value type:
<br>
<ul>
<li>For bayesians: a slider showing the a-priori value
     <p>
<li>For enumerated and ordinal types: the number of elements in 
set
</ul>
<p>
<h3><a name="row.3">Row 3: More about the Value</a></h3>
<!-- -->
These relate to the value.
     <p>
     <ul>
<a NAME="show.val">
<li> Show Value on Easel.</a>  The leftmost button in row 3 is 
a checkbox to say whether the current value of the attribute is 
to be shown on the main easel.  If ticked then the value of 
probability, bayesian and proportion attributes is shown as a 
horizontal line along the bottom, and this is either solid if 
answered and dotted if not.  If the attribute is of a boolean 
domain, then a line is shown that occupies the right half to 
show 'true' and the second left-quarter if 'false'.  Other 
domains are not shown at present.
<p>
<a NAME="inf">
<li> Infinite.</a>  The second button in row 3 is ticked if the 
value is infinite (as when dividing by 0).  At present not 
functional.
<p>
<a NAME="unk">
<li> Unknown.</a>  The third button in row 3 is ticked if the 
value is unknown and not ticked if known.
<p>
<a NAME="mbk">
<li> Must Be Known.</a>  You tick the rightmost button in row 3 
if the value must be known; that is unknown is not allowed. 
Normally used for question attributes, in which case the 
'Unknown' button is omitted from the <a href= 
"panels.html#uqp">User Question Panel</a>.
<p>
     </ul>

     <h3><a name="status">
Status of Attribute
     </a></h3><!-- -->

This is on the fourth row of the panel from version 1.1 (and 
lower down in previous versions).
     <p>
     <ul>
<a NAME="ans">
<li> Answered.</a>  This checkbox shows whether the attribute 
is answered or not.</a>  You cannot alter it internally (though 
you can alter the gadget).
     <p>
<a NAME="waiting">
<li> Waiting.</a>  Shows that an asynchronous attribute has 
been asked but its answer has still to arrive.  Not properly 
implemented yet (v1.1).
     <p>
<a NAME="error">
<li> Error Indicator.</a>  Shows an error has occurred in 
calculating the value of this attribute, e.g. that a 'must be 
known' attribute is found to have an unknown value.  Not yet 
fully implemented.
     <p>
     </ul>

<h3><a name="deriv">The Derivation</a></h3>
<!-- -->
This radio button, over the left side of the panel and nearly 
half way down, shows how this attribute's value is to be 
derived.  There are four options:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Constant:  The value is constant, as given in the <a 
href="#value">value gadget</a>.
     <p>
<li><a NAME="infer">Inferred</a>:  (the default)  The value is 
inferred from <a href="#antes">antecedent attributes</a> by the 
<a href="#im">inference method</a>.  If this option is selected 
but there are no antecedents then it is treated as <a 
href="#user.supp">user-supplied</a>.
     <p>
<li><a NAME="user.supp">User-supplied</a>:  A question is put 
to the user, whose text is the <a href="#qtext">question 
text</a> if present, or, failing this, the <a 
href="#meaning">meaning text</a> or the <a 
href="#label">label</a>.
     <p>
<a NAME="async">
<li>Async:</a>  This is like <a href="#user.supp">user-
supplied</a>, in that a question is put to the user, but 
asynchronously.  In this case the question is put but the 
search for input continues, and the user can answer at any 
time.  This facility is not likely to be very useful on its 
own; it is designed for use when, instead of asking the human 
user, Istar will post a request for information on the 
Internet.
</ul>
<p>

<a NAME="im">Inference Method for Attribute</a>.  This is a 
type gadget lying alongside the <a href="#infer">Infer</a> 
radio button.  Its window shows the current method, and hitting 
the wee button to its left brings up a list of inference 
methods appropriate to the <a href="#domain">domain</a> of this 
attribute.
     <p>
<a NAME="cutoffs">
In this area you sometimes get extra information about the 
inference mechanism.  For bayesians there are two cutoffs, 
lower and upper, whose purpose is to ignore minor antecedent 
factors.  Suppose a bayesian attribute has a lower cutoff set 
at 10% and four antecedents A,B,C,D.  A, B are answered with 
low values and the weights on C,D are such that however high 
they are answered the result cannot exceed 10% then the 
attribute is considered answered and C and D are ignored. 
Conversely for upper cutoff.
<p>
     <h4><a name="qnv">
Question Value
     </a></h4><!-- -->

Sometimes called 'Reset Value', 'RV'.  This controls the 
default value that is shown to the user in a question panel, 
that is the value that will be taken if they click 'OK' without 
setting the value.  (Used to be called 'reset value', as the 
value the attribute was reset to before the inference session 
began, but in fact it is now only the value shown in the panel 
that is set to this; so better called 'question value'.)
     <p>
Normally the question value is the current value of the 
attribute.  But sometimes you want to present a certain value 
every time, as a kind of default answer.  When this is so, set 
the left-most checkbox and set the right-most gadget to the 
value you wish the user to see in a question panel.
     <p>
<a NAME="xtxt">Explanation/Help Text</a>.  The long string 
gadget preceded by 'X' or 'H' holds explanation or help text. 
This is text that is dsiplayed to the user if they hit the 
'Help' button.

<h3><a name="override.row">The Override Row</a></h3>
<!-- -->

<a NAME="canover">Can Override</a>.  Toggle the checkbox, to 
left end of override row, to say whether or not the attribute 
can have an <a href="#override">override value</a>.
<p>
<a NAME="overridden">Overridden Status</a>.  This checkbox says 
whether the attribute is currently overridden.  In the present 
version of Istar, you can alter it.


<h3><a name="override">Override Value</a></h3>
<!-- -->
Overriding an attribute allows the user to temporarily insert a 
value of their choice that takes priority over the value 
obtained by the normal <a href="#deriv">derivation</a>.  This 
might be used, for instance, if the user is to be given the 
chance to say that they do not like the value that was 
inferred.  Normally you would place overridable attributes into 
one or more override lists.

<h3><a name="att.other">Other Info on Attribute</a></h3>
<!-- -->

   Next row:  Other information.
<ul>
<a NAME="topics">
<li>Topics</a>.  Bring up the <a href="panels.html#tpi">Topics 
panel</a> to allow you to link the attribute to topics of your 
choice.
     <p>
<a NAME="refces">
<li>References</a>:  Not yet used.  Will allow you to link 
attribute to external <a 
href="panels.html#refces">references</a>.
     <p>
<a NAME="item">
<li>Item</a> to which this attribute belongs.
<li>'See' takes you to the <a href= "panels.html#idp">Item 
Details Panel</a>.
     <p>
<a NAME="DSAP">
<li>DSAP</a>:  Unique internal identifier for the Attribute. 
('Data  Structure Area Pointer').
</ul>

     <h3><a name="visapp">
Visual Appearance
     </a></h3><!-- -->
This row deals with the visual appearance:
     <p>
     <ul>
<li>DSAP of EaselPiece that holds the visual appearance.
     <p>
<li>Pens: first is label colour, second is box outline.
     <p>
<li>Pattern: line pattern for drawing box: 1 or 0 represents a 
pixel in outline, repeating every 16.
     <p>
<li>Size: width and height in 1/256 of an inch (approx 0.1 mm) 
on 14 inch monitor and standard zooming.
     </ul>

     <h3><a name="exits">
Exit Buttons
     </a></h3><!-- -->
These buttons exit this panel.  They include:
     <p>
     <ul>
<a NAME="ok">
<li>'OK'</a> - which stores any changes made and exits.
     <p>
<a NAME="ok-act">
<li>'Ok-Act' - which stores any changes made, exits and brings 
up the <a href="panels.html#aap">Attribute Action Panel</a>.
     <p>
<a NAME="ok-texts">
<li>'Ok-Texts' - which stores any changes made, exits and 
brings up the <a href="panels.html#utxt">User Texts Panel</a>.
     <p>
<a NAME="ok-show">
<li>'OK-Show' - which stores any changes made, exits this panel 
and shows the attribute on the easel, hiding all else.
     <p>
<a NAME="apply">
<li>'Apply' - which stores any changes made but does not exit 
the panel.
     <p>
<a NAME="cancel">
<li>'Cancel' - which exits without storing any changes made - 
except for those changes made to the <a 
href="#antecons">lists</a> of antecedents and consequents.
     </ul>

<h3><a name="antecons">Antecedents and Consequents</a></h3>
<!-- -->

   Bottom of panel, left for antecedents, right for 
consequents, are two <a href="panels.html#panel.list">lists</a> 
with buttons.  These are underneath the exit buttons because 
anything you do with these lists will not be cancelled if you 
hit the 'Cancel' button.
<ul>
     <p>
<li>'See':  Click this to raise the attribute details panel for 
the selected attribute.
     <p>
<li>'R':  Click this to raise relationship instance panel for 
the selected link.
     <p>
<li>'X':  Click this to gain explanation of what happens in the 
link.
     <p>
<li>'1':  Click this to make that attribute first in list.
     <p>
<li> 'Wts':  Click this to bring up the <a href= 
"panels.html#wtp">Weights Panel</a> for either the antecedent 
or the consequent links.  So you can set the links all 
together.
</ul>
