NOTE:  If you want, you can get an IFF file dump of each panel by 
activating its window, placing cursor over its background and pressing 
RAmiga-RShift-W.  The result is stored in ram: disk as [hex.addr].iff.

<h2><a name="screens">THE SCREENS</a></h2>
<!-- -->

   Istar uses two screens, separate from Workbench.  The Control Screen 
comes  up first, with a grey background.  It is used for the panels.  The 
main  Easel comes up when you have a knowledge base ready.  Its size can 
changed  with the Prefs button on Initial Control Panel.
      <p>
<a NAME="cs">
 The control screen</a> usually resides along the bottom and can be moved 
manually using the two-pixel strips along its top.  Then there is a thin 
backdrop window that shows the meanings of items.  Important on this window 
is the gadget at the left hand end with two arrows.  This moves the control 
screen up and down quickly.
      <p>


<h3><a name="icp">The Initial Control Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->

<IMG SRC="panels/ic.panel.iff" ALT="Initial Control Panel" >
      <p>
   This small panel resides top left corner of the <a href="#cs">control 
screen</a>.  It has one column of buttons  that are relevant to the program 
itself, even when there is no KB - things like 'About' and 'Quit'.  The 
'Errors' button allows you to explore the various levels of any error that 
occurs, though it is perhaps of more use to technical users.
<p>
The 'Prefs' button takes you to the <a href="#prefs">Preferences Panel</a>.
      <p>
 But, to get going, use 'New' or 'Get KB', which will, respectively, create 
a new KB for you or load an existing one.  When a KB is successfully 
loaded the main easel will appear and on the control screen a KB panel will 
appear.  You can load or create any number of KBs (depending on memory), 
each with a drawing easel and each with its own KB panel.
      <p>
 (In version 1.01 you could only have a single KB at a time and there was 
no KB panel.  Instead, the main control panel held three columns of 
buttons and there were separate panels to select item type, relationship 
type and to show the goal list.)
      <p>
 The 'Prefs' button brings up a Preferences panel.
      <p>


<h3><a name="prefs">The Preferences Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/prefs.panel.iff" ALT="Preferences Panel" >
      <p>

   This panel is being developed.  You should normally only alter it right 
at  the start of the program at present, as some of its facilities have 
little  or no effect after a KB has arisen.  Try things and see: if it 
works, fine,  if not, remember to set it at start next time.
      <p>
   Its main purpose is to set a few parameters relating to new knowledge 
bases  (standard values in brackets):
      <p>

<ul>
<li>  #  Size and name of new KB (50,000 LWs and 30%)
<li>  #  Size and depth of its main Easel (30 by 24 inches)
</ul>
      <p>
   Dimensions are measured in 1/256 of inch (approx. tenth of a 
millimetre).
      <p>
 It also allows you to set the amount by which all main Easels scroll and 
to select fonts for:
      <p>

<ul>
<li>  #  Main Easel
<li>  #  Question panels
<li>  #  Documents (not yet used)
</ul>
      <p>
   Note that changes to the main easel font are only effective next easel 
you  bring up.
      <p>


<h3><a name="kbp">Main Knowledge Base Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
There is one Knowledge Base (KB) Panel for each knowledge base that Istar 
is dealing with.  It comprises two columns of  buttons at its left and two 
lists at its right, with a few other buttons.  The name of the KB is shown 
in the window title of the panel.
      <p>
<IMG SRC="panels/kb.panel.iff" ALT="Knowledge Base Control Panel" >
      <p>

      <p>
   First column are to do with current KB:
      <p>

<ul>
<li>  Save
<li>  Save As
<li>  KB Dump - to export ASCII translations of the KB
<li>  Easel - to manage the main <a href= "#eap">Easel</a>
<li>  KB Area - to see details and rename: <a href= "#kbap">KBA Panel</a>
<li>  Clone KB (not yet working)
<li>  Rid - to get rid of the KB
</ul>
      <p>
   Second column are to do with the knowledge in the current KB:
<ul>
<li>  See Easel - when multi KBs, to bring Easel to front
<li>  Infer Goals (to start a run)
<li>  Goal List (three part; see <a href="#glb">below</a>)
<li>  Documents (to <a href= "#docp">create a document</a> from a goal 
list)
<li>  Att Types (to manage <a href= "#atl">attribute types</a>)
<li>  Topics (to manage <a href= "#topics">topics</a>)
<li>  Lists (to manage <a href= "#listp">lists</a>)
<li>  Find (to <a href= "#find.name">search</a> for item etc. by name or 
sub-string)
</ul>
<p>
   Over the right hand half are two lists that are <a 
href="#panel.list">standard panel lists</a>.  <a NAME="itl">Above, is the 
Item Types list</a>.  This is perhaps the most frequently  used, as you 
change item type.  Adjoining it are buttons to create a new item  type, see 
and edit an existing type, and get rid of an item type (dangerous, since 
you lose all items of that  type; try it on a dummy KB you have created for 
the purpose!).
      <p>
<a NAME="rtl">
   Below right is the Relationship Types list</a>, with buttons to create a 
new  relationship type or edit an existing one.  You will seldom use this 
list,  except when you are making up specific relationships.
      <p>
<p>
Program-wise, the KB Panel is controlled internally by a yyModuleKBData 
(where yy is the signature of the module that is the program, e.g. 'kt' for 
Istar or 'nn' for Annotator) structure which holds all information that 
pertains to the access to this particular knowledge base by this particular 
running of this program (or, strictly, module).  Normally it would hold the 
addresses of gadgets for the KB Panel.  In this way we obtain an easy way 
for any program to have any number of KBs active at any time, each having 
different current item types etc.
      <p>
<a NAME="glb">
Second column of KB Panel, in the middle, there is a three-part gadget 
which has the name of the current goal list in its middle.  Left wee button 
allows you to select a new goal list from among the lists currently in the 
KB.  Right wee 'S' button will bring up the goal lists's Item Details Panel 
so you can peruse and, if needed, reorder, the goals in the list.  Hitting 
the ResetGoals and InferGoals buttons operate of the current goal list.


<h4><a name="new.it">Creating a New Item Type</a></h4>

   To create a new item type the main thing is to give it a name, and then 
some other information depending on what you want it for.  On the <a 
href="#kbp">KB Panel</a>, hit the 'New' button adjoining the item types 
list.  This creates a new item type with null name (a dash) and presents 
you with the <a href="#itp">Item Type Panel</a> for this, where you fill in 
its details.

<h4><a name="new.rt">Creating a New Relationship Type</a></h4>

   Click the 'New' button adjoining the Relationship Types list on the <a 
href="#kbp">KB panel</a>.  A new type is created for you, and the <a 
href="#rtp">Relationship Type Panel</a> appears, allowing you to fill in 
its name and other details.

<h4><a name="new.at">To Create a New Domain (Attribute Type)</a></h4>

There are two ways of creating a new domain or attribute type.
<p>
At any time you can create one by hitting the 'Att Types' button in the 
second column of the <a href="#kbp">KB Panel</a>.  This brings up a <a 
href="#atl">panel of currently available domains</a>.  Hit the adjoining 
'New' button, and up comes the <a href="#ndp">New Domain Panel</a>.
<p>
<a NAME="add.att">
Or you can create one while in the process of adding an attribute to an 
item or an item type</a> - which is convenient since it is often at that 
point that you realise the domain you need is not available.  To start 
this, you hit the 'New' button adjoining a list of attributes, and this 
brings up the <a href="#nap">New Item Attribute Panel</a> from which you 
can access the <a href="#ndp">New Domain Panel</a>.



<h3><a name="kbap">The KB Details Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/kbd.panel.iff" ALT="Knowledge Base Details Panel" >
      <p>

   Hit the 'KB Area' button on <a href= "#kbp">KB panel</a>, and up comes 
the 'Knowledge Base  Area' (KBA) panel, which tells you various details 
about the KB itself.  The  most useful things are:
      <p>

<ul>
<li>  Name:  You can change the name of your KB, up to 40 chars.
<li>  DSA % Expansion:  Make this higher for dynamic KBs; it is the 
amount (as a %) of free space ('virgin glass' if we use the metaphor   of 
recycling glass bottles) created in the KB when it is next loaded. 
Standard value is 30%, which gives plenty for the average knowledge 
engineering session.  DSA means 'Data Structure Area' - where almost 
everything goes.
<li>  Min DSA:  30% of zero is zero, which is a problem when your KB is 
young.  So we also stipulate a minimum size for the DSA.  Standard   value 
is 50,000 longwords (200,000 bytes).
</ul>   Altering the last two resizes the KBA when you hit 'OK' (though it 
doesn't  work yet in Version 1.03) but you should seldom need to do so.  Of 
minor  interest are the following:
      <p>

<ul>
<li>  KBA at:  The address in memory of the start of the KBA.  Decimal.
<li>  Actual size:  Actual size in memory (bytes).
<li>  Blocks:  How many separate blocks in the KB.  An Istar free 
attribute typically comprises around 10 blocks.
<li>  Bottles and Glass:  This shows how much 'free space' or 'glass' 
there is to be recycled.  Bottles shows how many separate pieces,   Glass 
the total amount (in bytes).  Usually only of minor interest,   except when 
the KB gets fragmented.
</ul>   Other, less useful things are:
      <p>

<ul>
<li>  Version:  Ignore this.  At present always 0.  It is the version of 
software, NOT of the knowledge you have put there.
<li>  Max Ring Length:  Occasionally this is used to check against 
infinite loops, but not always.  Usually ignore it at 9999.
<li>  Tasks:  How many Amiga tasks are currently sharing this.  Always 1 
at present (the current task).
<li>  'R' button bottom left, exports ring details (for s/w developers).
</ul>

      <h3><a name="eap">
Easel Control Panel
      </a></h3><!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/ea.panel.iff" ALT="Easel Control Panel" >
      <p>
This panel, as yet poorly designed, allows you to do three things at 
present:
      <p>
      <ul>
<li> Export the contents of the main Easel (as shown), either as IFF or 
Postscript.
<li> Alter colours of easel pens (enter pen number and alter sliders) 
(Note: there is no reset, and the effects of moving sliders is immediate 
and not undone by exiting the panel.)
<li> Resize the easel, either immediately or on next KB load.
      </ul>
Exit the panel by the 'No Resize' button.


<h3><a name="adp">The Attribute Details Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/ad.panel.iff" ALT="Attribute Details Panel" >
      <p>
<small>(Because this is complex panel, you might find it useful to bring up 
its <a href= "p.adp.html">imagemap</a> which explains each of its gadgets 
individually.)</small>
      <p>
The Attribute Details panel for an attribute gives lots of information 
about it.  The main way to bring it up is to click with RMB on an attribute 
box, but it will also come up if you hit the 'See' button of any <a 
href="#panel.list">panel list</a> that shows attributes.  The panel is 
multi-threading so that you can have any number of them up at once and can 
continue to operate the main easel and other panels the while.
      <p>
For details of this panel, see <a href="p.adp.html">p.adp.html</a>, which 
shows an example as an imagemap to all its parts.  The information it 
contains includes:
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>Name and meaning, and DSAP of attribute
<li>Type and current value, and whether to show value on easel
<li>Current state: whether answered, etc.
<li>The item it belongs to, with 'See' button to take you to it
<li>Antecedent and consequent attributes and items
<li>Derivation: constant, inferred, user-supplied and asynchronous
<li>Inference method and cutoffs
<li>Whether overridable, text for override and whether overridden
<li>Exit buttons.

      </ul>
      <p>

      <h3><a name="utxt">
The User Texts Panel
      </a></h3><!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/ut.panel.iff" ALT="User Texts Panel" >
      <p>

(This is available only from Version 1.0872.  Before that, some user texts 
are set up on the <a href="#adp">Attribute Details Panel</a>).
      <p>
The User Texts Panel allows you to set up texts that the user will 
experience when running the KB.  There are a number of texts, with various 
purposes, and a means of moving and swapping texts around.  The texts that 
can be set from the panel include:
      <p>

      <ul>
<li> The Label of the attribute as seen on the main easel.  (This is also 
settable on the <a href="#adp">Attribute Details Panel</a>.)
      <p>
<li> The Meaning of the attribute.  (This is also settable on the <a 
href="#adp">Attribute Details Panel</a>.)
      <p>
<li> Question Text:  Text put to the user when the value of this attribute 
is being asked of them.
      <p>
<li> Form Text:  A shortened version of the Question Text for use on Forms. 
The space indicated is approximately that available on the Form.
      <p>
<li> Override Text:  Like Question Text, but allows different wording to be 
presented when overriding the attribute's value.
      <p>
<a NAME="utxt.help">
<li> Help Texts</a>:  There are eight of these, the first one labelled 
'Help' and seven others labelled '.. 1' to '.. 7'.  These are brought up 
for the user when s/he hits one of the Help buttons on the User Answer 
Panel.  You may use the different help texts for any purpose you like, for 
instance text 1 is used to define terms, text 4 to give hints on how to 
seek the information being asked for, etc.  But be sure to communicate 
these conventions to the user!
      <p>
<a NAME="utxt.temp">
<li> Temporary Text 'T'</a>:  This text is for holding temporary texts. 
Its main purpose is to allow text to be copied to the other texts or 
swapped with them (as notified by the state of the cycle gadget to its 
left).  Note that the T text is persistent in the KB.  Once you have 
finished with it you should empty it (using e.g. Amiga-X).
      <p>
<a NAME="utxt.t.buttons">
<li> The 'T' Buttons</a>:  Hitting one of these will modify the text 
alongside the button, either copying the T Text to this text or swapping 
them.  Which happens depends on the cycle gadget by the T Text.  By a 
sequence of T hits, with suitable altering of the cycle gadget, you can 
duplicate, move, swap texts.  Note that all such alterations are 
accomplished via the T Text.
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="aap">
The Attribute Action Panel
      </a></h3><!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/aa.panel.iff" ALT="Attribute Action Panel" >
      <p>

The Attribute Action Panel is a small panel with various buttons allowing 
you to take action on the attribute.  It is intended for use by the 
knowledge engineer.  The panel is small so you can have several in view, 
for several attributes in which you have an interest.  The buttons include 
(different panel for <a href= "#atp.pre.1.1">before version 1.1</a>):
      <p>
      <ul>
<li> 'Infer' (top left):  Start an <a href="rfman.html#infce">inference 
session</a> from this attribute as its only goal.  All its antecedents are 
reset and you should get the first <a href= "#uqp">User Question Panel</a>.
      <p>
<li> 'INR' (Infer, No Reset):  As above, but don't reset before.  Sometimes 
you want to retain a number of answered values without having to answer 
them.
      <p>
<li> 'Resume':  Resume from a paused inference session.
      <p>
<li> 'ResetAntes':  Just do a reset of the antecedents of this attribute. 
Hitting 'ResetAntes' then 'INR' is equivalent to hitting 'Infer'.
      <p>
<li>'Override' (middle, only present if overriding allowed on the 
attribute):  Hit this to bring up a <a href="#uqp">question panel</a> that 
will ask a value and place it in the attribute's override slot.
      <p>
<li>'Add Goal' (top middle):  Hit this to add this attribute to the current 
<a href="rfman.html#goal.list">goal list</a>.
      <p>
<li>'Rid' (bottom middle):  Hit this to remove the attribute.  WARNING: 
You are not asked to confirm deletion, and when you delete all its 
relationships are deleted too; so be careful.
      <p>
<li>'Data..' (top right):  A short cut to the <a href="#adp">Attribute 
Details Panel</a>.
      <p>
<li> 'Texts..' Bring up the <a href= "#utxt">User Texts Panel</a>.
      <p>
<li>'Done' (bottom right):  To send the panel away.
      </ul>
      <p>
Prior to version 1.1, this panel had different buttons on the left hand 
side.  Its 'Infer' button did NOT do a reset; you had to hit the 'Reset' 
button first in most cases.


<h3><a name="idt">The Item Details Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/id.panel.iff" ALT="Item Details Panel" >
      <p>


   The item details panel can be accessed by clicking the 'See' button on 
the  attribute details panel attached to the item name.  It will also 
appear if  you click on an item box on the easel, such as a form.
      <p>
 Most of it is straightforward, such as label/name and meaning.
      <p>
There is a <a href= "#panel.list">list</a> of attributes it contains at the 
bottom.  With this you can select an attribute and bring up its panel with 
'See', create new attributes by hitting 'New' (at which point the <a href= 
"#nap">New Attribute Panel</a> comes up, and you can delete attributes from 
an item.  Note that you can add an attribute to an item without adding it 
to the item type.  You can also rearrange the attributes in the item using 
the '1' and 'n' buttons, in which case you will find that on the easel they 
are also rearranged.
      <p>
On the left and right half way down are two lists of other things the item 
relates to (all types of relationship).  These are <a href= 
"#panel.list">standard list boxes</a> so that you can go to the thing, 
rearrange things, etc.
      <p>
 You can attach an item to <a href= "#tpi">topics</a> as by hitting the 
'topics' button.
      <p>
There might be other things, such as form text.

      <h3><a name="nap">
New Item Attribute Panel
      </a></h3><!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/na.panel.iff" ALT="New Item Attribute Panel" >
      <p>
This panel adds a new attribute to an item, item type, relationship, or 
relationship type.  Follow the instruction 1,2,3.  Select a domain 
(attribute type), give it a name, and a meaning.  If the domain does not 
exist, hit the 'New Domain' button and up comes the <a href= "#ndp">New 
Domain Panel</a> so you can create one.


<h3><a name="ri">The Relationship Instance Details Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/ri.panel.iff" ALT="Relationship Instance Panel" >
      <p>


   The relationship details panel comes up if you click on a link on the 
main  easel or if you click the wee 'R' button in a <a href= 
"#panel.list">list box</a> on a panel.  It gives details about the 
relationship, including  antecedent and consequent.
      <p>
 The main things of interest are the unary operator, and the weight. The 
use of these is explained in the <a href= "using.html">Using Istar</a> 
document.  Note that if you change the type, unary operator or weight then 
the visual appearance of the easelpiece of the relationship can change. 
For inference relationships the colour can switch between the main and the 
negative pen colours, depending on whether the uop or weight invert the 
effects of the antecedent.
      <p>
The Explain button brings up an explanation of what would happen when 
inference is performed with this relationship.
      <p>

      <h3><a name="wtp">
The Weights Panel
      </a></h3><!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/wt.panel.iff" ALT="Weights Panel" >
      <p>
This panel is a convenience to the knowledge engineer.  It allows you to 
set the weights of all the inference antecedents (or consequents) of an 
attribute.  In the ICT project we found setting the bayesian weights a 
cumbersome operation, especially when we wanted to set the weight of one 
antecedent relevant to others.  This panel allows you to do this; it is 
accessible by hitting the 'Wts' buttons on the <a href= "#adp">Attribute 
Details Panel</a> beside the lists of antecedents or consequents (available 
from version 1.1 onwards).  (Actually, not always all the weights: only as 
many as will fit on the panel; in the rare cases you have more, you will 
have to set the further ones separately - or else move the further ones up 
the list, use this panel, and then move them back again.)
      <p>
This panel had a <a href= "bugs.html#1.1.wtp">bug</a> in version 1.1.

<h3><a name="itp">Item Type Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/it.panel.iff" ALT="Item Type Panel" >
      <p>

The Item Type Panel shows details of an item type.  Normally you will see 
it when you <a href="#kbp.new.it">create a new item type</a> but sometimes 
you may wish to alter details of an existing one.  When creating a new item 
type:
<p>
<ul>
<li>  Enter the name for the item type.
<p>
<li> Ignore all the checkboxes for now.
<p>
<li>  What colours do you want?  First Pen gives colour of label, if any. 
Second Pen gives colour of outline box.  Pattern gives pattern for outline 
box.  Similar to Relationship Type Panel.  (This is not available in 
versions earlier than 1.03.)
<p>
<li>  What attributes should it have?  What standard relationships?  At 
this point you would set these; but what you do will depend on the use of 
items of this type, whether they are:
<ul>
<li>part of a <a href="#itp.sn">semantic network</a>,
<li>part of a <a href="#itp.db">database</a>,
<li>holders of <a href="#itp.fa">free attributes</a>.
</ul>
In any case, you can create attributes later, and even change the usage.
<p>
<li>  Click the 'OK' button.  Type made.
</ul>
<p>
  (The new type is automatically selected for drawing.)
      <p>


<h4><a name="itp.sn">Items for Semantic Net</a></h4>

   In a <a href="using.sn.html">semantic net (or a cognitive map)</a> the 
important thing about items is the relationships they have with other 
items.  So it is a good idea to define relationship types that will be 
drawn from the items of this type.  So we add a couple of extra steps to 
the above, to define the relationship types you want (not available until 
version 1.03).
<p>
<ul>
<li> Click 'New' button under Item Type list on the KB panel.
<li> Enter the name for it.
<li> Ignore all the checkboxes for now.
<li> What colours do you want?
<p>

<li> Do you want any relationship types?  There are four type gadgets mid-
panel, showing 'None' and labelled 'Left', 'Right', 'Top' and 'Bottom'. 
These allow you to set up to for standard relationship types that can be 
drawn from this type of item, according to the edge from which you start 
drawing.  See <a href= "using.sn.html#edge.rels">below</a> for details. 
Click the 'Right' one.  Up comes a list of relationship  types.  [Bug in 
early version 1.03:  If there is more than one KB active, the  list will 
not appear; get rid of all but this KB.]  Select one, such as  'Precedence' 
and click the 'OK' button.
      <p>
<li> Click the 'OK' button on the Item Types Panel.
</ul>
      <p>
Now you're done, draw two items of this new type on the easel.  Draw a link 
from the  right hand edge of the left one to the other.  It should draw a 
Precedence (or your chosen) relationship; you can check this by bringing up 
the <a href="#ri">Relationship Instance  Details panel</a> for the 
relationship.
      <p>
Note that we did not set the 'Left' relationship type.  We could do so. 
But when it is 'None' then the type drawn will be that shown selected in 
the <a href= "#rtl">Relationship Types List</a> on the KB panel. (For top 
and bottom types, 'None' means 'do not draw from here'; for details, see <a 
href= "using.sn.html#edge.rels">drawing different rel types</a>.
      <p>


<h4><a name="itp.db">Items as Database Records</a></h4>


   The other main use of items is as a database record, a collection of 
attributes.  So for this, we take a few extra steps to add attributes. 
(You can create item types with both relationship types and attributes; no 
problem.)
      <p>
<ul>
<li> Click 'New' button under Item Type list on the KB panel.
<li> Enter the name for it.
<li> Ignore all the checkboxes for now.
<li> What colours do you want?
      <p>
<li> Down the bottom is the attribute list.  Hit the adjoining 'New' 
button.
<p>
<li>Up comes a smaller panel to <a href="#add.att">add an attribute</a>; 
take the steps indicated.  You can create new attribute types at this point 
if you need to.
<p>
<li>Keep adding attributes as needed.
<p>
   #  Click the 'OK' button.
</ul>
      <p>


<h4><a name="itp.fa">Items as Free Attributes</a></h4>
<!-- -->
<a href="rfman.html#freeatts">Free attributes</a> have items that are not 
visible and whose only reason for existence is to support the single 
attribute.  Such items are defined as having precisely one attribute and 
having no item box.  You will seldom need to create a free attribute item 
type, because they are usually created automatically when you create an 
attribute type, but should you need to, the procedure is a variation on the 
above, as follows:
      <p>
<ul>
<li> Click 'New' button under Item Type list on the KB panel.
<li> Enter the name for it.
<li> Ignore all the checkboxes for now.
<p>
<li> Hit the 'Own box' gadget to turn it off - meaning that no item box is 
drawn.
<p>
<li> Ignore the colours and pattern since they refer only to the item box, 
not to the (attribute) box that is seen.
      <p>
<li> Create exactly one attribute as above, by hitting the 'New' button 
adjoining the attribute list.  Up comes a smaller panel to <a 
href="#add.att">add an attribute</a>; take the steps indicated.  You can 
create new attribute types at this point if you need to.
<p>
<li>Hit the 'OK' button.
</ul>
      <p>
You can also create a free attribute item type via the <a 
href="#atp">Attribute Type Panel</a>.

<h3><a name="atl">Attribute Types List Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/atl.panel.iff" ALT="Attribute Type List Panel" >
      <p>


This panel is a standard <a href="#panel.list">panel list</a>.  It shows 
the currently available domains (attribute types) plus a few other buttons:
<p>
<ul>
<li>'See' button:  Brings up the <a href="#atp">Attribute Type Panel</a> 
which allows you to change various details of the selected domain.
<li>'New' button:  Brings up the <a href="#ndp">New Domain Panel</a> which 
creates a new domain.
<li>'Rid' button:  Gets rid of the selected domain (attribute type), asking 
you first.
<li>'1', 'n' buttons:  Moves the chosen domain up and down the list.
</ul>

<h3><a name="atp">Attribute Type (Domain) Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/at.panel.iff" ALT="Attribute Type Panel" >
      <p>

This panel shows the details of an attribute type (domain), including 
standard things like its name, meaning, value type, and visual appearance. 
In addition it has a list of Value Names, especially for use in enumerated 
and ordinal types, and a button that creates a free attribute item type for 
it.

<h3><a name="ndp">New Domain Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/nd.panel.iff" ALT="New Domain Panel" >
      <p>

This panel allows you to create a new domain (attribute type).  You will 
probably use it most to create enumerated and ordinal types.  It is fairly 
simple process, in which the steps are numbered for you, 1,2,3:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <a href="rfman.html#value.types">value type</a> for the 
domain.
<li>Enter a name for it.
<li>Enter a meaning for it, if any.
<li>Hit 'OK'
</ol>
Sometimes, after this the <a href="#atp">Attribute Type Panel</a> comes up 
to allow you to set other details if you wish.


<h3><a name="rtp">Relationship Type Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/rt.panel.iff" ALT="Relationship Type Panel" >
      <p>

This panel allows you to define or change the details for the relationship 
type, including its name, its usage syntax and semantics, and the visual 
appearance of the lines that  express its instances on the main easel.
      <p>
<ul>
<li>  Enter a name.
      <p>
<li>  Usage syntax: Is it DAG or not?  If DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) then 
you cannot form  cycles with instances of this type of relationship.  That 
is, you cannot  build a KB with links e.g. from A to B, B to C, C to D, and 
D back to A  (though you can have A to B, B to C, C to D and A to D).  Many 
types of  relationship are DAGs, e.g. most dependencies.
      <p>
<li>  Usage semantics: If it is DAG, does this type of relationship perform 
inference?  Usually  not.
      <p>
<li>  Pens and pattern.  The two pens can define the colours in which 
instances of this type of relationship will be drawn for positive and 
negative versions of the relationship.  If either is zero then a default 
colour will be used that indicates whether the relationship is a DAG, is 
inference or not.  The pattern is 16 pixels repeated along the line. 
Usually used to give visual indication of type of relationship.
      <p>
<li>  Do relationship instances of this type have any attributes?  If so, 
add them one by one <a href="#add.att">as for an item type</a>.
      <p>
<li>  When done, click the 'Change' button (or 'Cancel').
</ul>
      <p>
Note that, though now selected in the Relationship Types list in the <a 
href="#kbp">KB Panel</a>, the next relationship you draw might not be of 
this type, since the selected item type might have a <a 
href="rfman.html#std.reltypes">standard relationship type</a>.
      <p>
 Note that if you alter the visual appearance, existing instances of this 
type will not be altered in visual appearance.  But new instances will 
take on the new appearance.  Also, when you bring up a Relationship Details 
panel and click 'OK' the visual appearance will change.
      <p>
 BEWARE:  Do not change parameters of the standard relationship types 
(though you may change their visual appearance to suit your tastes).  In 
particular, if you make 'Inference' to be not a DAG you will be allowed to 
create an infinite loop in the KB.
      <p>

      <h3><a name="tpi">
Topics of Item
      </a></h3><!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/tpi.panel.iff" ALT="Topics of Item Panel" >
      <p>

The Topics panel is brought up for an item, attribute or relationship and 
shows one or more banks of checkboxes, each with the name of a topic.  You 
can link your thing to any of the topics shown by ticking the appropriate 
boxes.  You can set up new topics by bringing up the <a href= 
"#topics">Topics Panel</a>, described next.
      <p>
The above example shows two different uses of topics:
      <ul>
<li> For 'real' topics such as the contractor's responsibility, the works, 
control of works and design (which this item is linked to).
<li> For 'administrative' topics useful to the knowledge engineer while 
developing the KB, such as 'look at later' or 'I have reversed the 
antecedents of this item', which is a note to yourself for later action. 
(When all these have been dealt with you might wish to get rid of those 
topics.)
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="topics">
Topics Control Panel
      </a></h3><!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/tpc.panel.iff" ALT="Topics Control Panel" >
      <p>
This panel, brought up when you hit the 'Topics' button on <a href= "#">KB 
Panel</a>, allows you to:
      <p>
      <ul>
<li> See, on the main easel, the items linked to a topic of your choice, 
by:
      <ol>
<li> Hit the 'HideAll' button to clear the easel
<li> Select topic from list
<li> Hit the 'Show' button
<li> You may repeat steps 2,3 to build up a picture
      </ol>
<li> Hitting the 'MkList' button will make a list of all things in a given 
topic (or is it all things shown? can't remember).<!-- ====-->
<li> Create new topics (fill in name and hit 'New)
<li> Arrange the topics list: reorder using 1,n buttons or remove a topic 
with the 'Rid' button
<li> See topic as an item (select it and hit 'See')
      </ul>

      <h3><a name="refces">
References
      </a></h3><!-- -->
The References facility is not yet available.  It will allow you to link 
things to external references, e.g. to record why it was that you linked 
two attributes that would not normally be linked.

      <h3><a name="listp">
The List Panel: Make Lists of Things
      </a></h3><!-- -->

<IMG SRC="panels/lists.panel.iff" ALT="Lists Panel" >
      <p>


The Lists Panel is used to form <a href="rfman.html#lists">lists</a> of 
things, rather like performing a database 'select' or 'join' from the KB. 
The lists themselves can then be used to create other lists from.  It 
requires a two-step operation which is shown on the panel as two long cycle 
buttons, the width of the panel, and various detail gadgets below them:
      <p>
<ul>
<li>  First, the source for the list.  It could be all attributes, items 
and/or relationships, or it could be all instances of a particular type, or 
it could be all members of an existing list, or it could be all those 
linked to members of an existing list.  The last two are equivalent 
respectively to relational select and relational join in database 
terminology.
      <p>
<li>  Second, which of the elements in source to select?  It could be all 
of them, or only those that fulfil certain conditions, or all those except 
them.  The conditions as present are fairly simple: containing a text in 
their names or meanings, attributes that are answered etc., topological 
conditions, or (from version 1.12) those found in another list.
      <p>
<li>  Third, hit the 'Do It' button, to create the list.
      <p>
<li>  You will be given <a href= "#idp">item details panel</a> for new 
list; enter a name for it.  If it's not what you want, hit the Delete 
button, otherwise hit OK.
      <p>
<li> Now you can see the selected items on Easel by hitting either the 
'Show Them' or the '+Links' buttons on top row.  (In fact you can use this 
to see contents of any list, but first selecting the list via the middle 
gadget on the top row.)
      <p>
<li> You can export the details of the list by hitting the 'Export' button.
      <p>
<li> You can then do another list creation.  Hit 'Reset' button (bottom 
right) to reset most gadgets.
      <p>
<li> To get rid of a list, select it with middle top gadget, hit 'See' to 
obtain its <a href= "#idp">item details panel</a> and hit Delete.
      <p>
<li> When finished, hit 'Done' (top right).  But remember: the lists you 
have created stay in your KB until you expressly get rid of it.  So, from 
time to time, have a clear out.
</ul>
      <p>
You might notice that these operations are similar to various relational 
database operations.  The source is the equivalent of a relational table, 
but is more sophisticated, especially being able to source from the whole 
DAG fans of things in a given list.  To achieve each of the RDB operations 
do the following:
      <ul>
<li> <code>SELECT</code>: Switch second bar to select, and switch at least 
one of the 'Ignore this' conditions to 'Those that'.  However, at present 
you cannot select on attribute value.
<li> <code>PROJECT</code>: Cannot be done because it doesn't make sense. 
The output is a list of things, not a table of values, and you get all 
attributes and properties of whatever is in your output list.  Moreover, 
the output list can be a mix of things (items, atts, rels).
<li> <code>JOIN</code>: Switch source bar to 'From all things directly 
related to member of given list ..'.  Choose a source list and a 
relationship to traverse.  Second bar: 'Take all regardless' is a pure 
join; but you can also select as part of the operation by switching to the 
select or exclude options.
<li> <code>INTERSECTION</code>: Switch source bar to 'From members of given 
list ..'.  Choose a source list.  Switch second bar to select as above.
<li> <code>MINUS</code>: Switch source bar to 'From members of given list 
..'.  Choose a source list.  Switch second bar to exclude as above.
<li> <code>UNION</code>: Cannot be done at present.
<li> <code>TIMES</code>: Not sure that can be done at present.

<h3><a name="find.name">Finding Something by Name</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/find.panel.iff" ALT="Find/Search Panel" >
      <p>

This panel allows you to find an attribute, item, etc. either by portion of 
name or if you have its DSAP.  On <a href= "#kbp">KB Panel</a>, click the 
'Find' button.  This brings up the Find  panel (which in the current 
version is rather sparse and empty).  It allows  you to find attributes, 
attribute types, items, item types, relationships,  relationship types by 
sub-strings their names contain.
      <p>
   #  Enter the sub-string in the long string gadget at the top.
      <p>
   #  Then click either Item, Att or Rel, depending on what you want to 
find.  It then brings up a panel for the thing found, if any: an attribute 
action  panel, an item details panel or a relationship instance panel.
      <p>
   #  Note that it will search the types before the instances.
      <p>
   #  If it's not the one you want, send that panel away (Cancel or Done) 
and  click Continue.  It will continue the search from where it left off.
      <p>
   #  You can watch the number.
      <p>
   #  If you want to find the total number of items, attributes or 
relationships, clear the string gadget and hit the appropriate button.  The 
number then shows you the total number, including the number of types.
      <p>
   #  (Note that in current version, Rel does not work.)
      <p>

      <h3><a name="docp">
Document Creation Panel
      </a></h3><!-- -->
<IMG SRC="panels/dc.panel.iff" ALT="Document Creation Panel" >
      <p>
This panel allows you create documents from a goal list (if the goal list 
contains attributes of text fragments).  Follow the steps, 1,2,3, and then 
export the document if you wish.  ('txt' export not available at present.) 
You can export after step 2 if you wish.
<hr>

<h2><a name="panel.list">Panel List Boxes</a></h2>
<!-- -->
A number of panels have lists of things from which you may select, and 
which are surrounded by various buttons:
<p>
<ul>
<li>'See' button:  Brings up the appropriate panel showing details of the 
selected thing and allowing you to change them.
<p>
<li>'R' button:  Only relevant when the list is of things related to the 
current thing, this button brings up details of the relationship to the 
selected thing, rather than of the selected thing itself.
<p>
<li>'X' button:  In some cases this button provides a more detailed 
explanation than the 'See' or 'R' buttons.
<p>
<li>'New' button:  Creates a new element for the list, of the appropriate 
type.  Normally then another panel appears, allowing you to set details of 
the new thing.
<p>
<li>'Rid' or 'Rem' button:  Gets rid of the selected thing, or remove the 
relationship to it.
<p>
<li>'1', 'n' buttons:  Moves the chosen domain up and down the list.
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="eup">End User Panels</a></h2>
<!-- -->
These are forms that appear during an inference session, when you hit 
either the 'Infergoals' button on the <a href= "#kbp">KB Panel</a> or the 
'infer' button on the <a href= "#aap">Attribute Action Panel</a>.  That is, 
the end user sees them.

<h3><a name="uqp">User Question Panel</a></h3>
<!-- -->

<IMG SRC="panels/uq.bayes.panel.iff" ALT="Bayesian User Question Panel" >
      <p>

This panel, presented during the <a href="rfman#infce">inference</a> 
process, asks for the value of one attribute.  It has:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Some text that shows what is being asked for.
<li>A gadget in the middle where the value is entered, and whose type is 
suited to the type of attribute (this one is a degree of belief, or a 
'bayesian'; others occur below)
<li>'OK' button when you have entered the value.
<li>'Unknown' button if you want to say you don't know the value.
<li>'Pause' button to pause the inference process.
<li>'Help' buttons, to display any help text that there might be.  Main 
'Help' plus helps 1-7 if available (if blank, none available; on this one, 
only help 7 is available; on one below, helps 1,5 are available).  Brings 
up the <a href= "#uhp">Help Panel</a>.
<li>'Back Qns' button, that puts up a list of questions answered and allows 
you to reset them so that they come up next time.
<li>(From version 1.08) Sometimes, an override button above 'OK'.
<li> Small 'Att' button bottom left, useful to the knowledge engineer, as 
it brings up the <a href= "#utxt">User Texts Panel</a>, and allows changes 
to be made in e.g. question text there and then (though the change does not 
appear immediately)
<li> Small 'Cons' button, bottom left, which shows the consequent fan of 
the question on the easel, that is, what this question could affect.  Very 
useful for both the knowledge engineer and the advanced user.
</ul>
      <p>
Here are two more examples, of different value types: boolean and 
enumerated type.  Note the rather tiny check box on the boolean; must make 
it look better!
      <p>

<h3><a name="ufp">The End User Form</a></h3>
<!-- -->

<IMG SRC="panels/uf.bool.panel.iff" ALT="Boolean User Form Panel" >
      <p>

It can be cumbersome to the user to be asked six questions one by one, 
especially when they all concern one entity, such as name, address, age, 
gender of a patient.  Such attributes can be linked to a Form, so that if 
any one of them is needed then a Form panel is presented which requests 
them all.
<p>
At present, the Form facility is simple, and has the following 
characteristics:
<p>
<ul>
<li>A full screen panel.
<li>A short text to introduce the Form, e.g. "Please give the following 
information about the patient:".  The text is in the Question font which 
can be set by the <a href="#PREF">Preferences</a> panel.
<li>Up to about ten value gadgets down the middle or right half of the 
panel, with their texts down the left half.
<li>The number ten is determined by the amount of space that each gadget 
takes up until all the Form space is used up.  If there are more than this 
number of attributes on the form, then two or more forms are produced for 
the user until all are answered.
<li> With each, a small 'H' button that brings up the <a href= "#uhp">User 
Help</a> panel for that question.
<li>Two buttons 'OK' and 'Pause'.
</ul>
      <p>
Here is a form with bayesians, showing its use for another purpose, that of 
setting priorities among options:

      <p>
This panel comes up when you hit a Help button on either a <a href= 
"#uqp">question</a> or <a href= "#ufp">form</a> panel.  There can be up to 
eight help texts, a main one and those numbered 1..7.  If the latter are 
available then a number appears in their box.  Hit any of the boxes to 
bring up the appropriate help text.  (If a particular help text is not 
available, then the Meaning text or label will come up instead.)  Hit 
'Noted' when you have finished.  The help texts are set up in the <a href= 
"#utxt">User Texts Panel</a>.
