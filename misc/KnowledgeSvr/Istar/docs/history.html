      <h2><a name="future">
The Near Future
      </a></h2><!-- -->
I am hoping that version 1.2 will have the ability to seek data from a URL 
automatically.  Also a new inference method which will extract sub-strings 
from a longer one (such as from a down-loaded web page).
      <p>
I am hoping that version 1.3 will have simple actions, that will be 
instigated when e.g. all goals in a list become answered.

      <h2><a name="v1.14">
Version 1.14 - April 2000
      </a></h2><!-- -->

Note:  Version 1.13 was not published, so the changes made in that version 
will be new to many.
      <p>
#  By accident Istar required TCP/IP version of 4.  This has been reduced 
to 2.
      <p>
#  I have added the ability to draw arrows from the top and bottom edges of 
boxes, as well as the right and left.  This is because some users are used 
to drawing relationships top to bottom rather than left to right.  But, in 
general, this facility allows up to four different types of relationship to 
be drawn easily from any given box, without having to manually make a 
selection.  See <a href= "using.sn.html#edge.rels">Drawing Different 
Relationship Types</a> in the 'Using Istar for Semantic Nets' document. 
Note that to draw from top or bottom you have to set the top and bottom 
RelTypes of the Item Type specifically.
      <p>
#  There was an esoteric bug in the input routine, which might have caused 
a problem but only in exceptionally rare circumstances; now fixed.
      <p>
I have internally decoupled the user input from server input, so that the 
former can be included in programs (other than Istar) without needing to 
link in the server module.


      <h2><a name="v1.13">
Version 1.13 - January 2000 (Not published)
      </a></h2><!-- -->

#  For some time I had been worried that certain operations on items etc. 
that make changes to those items are carried out by keyhits over the 
easelpiece of the said items.  e.g. Add to goal list: you hit 'G' key when 
mouse is over the item; to minimize you hit 'M' when key is over item.  I 
felt this was a bit dangerous, e.g. against accidental hitting of keys.  So 
I thought it better if keyhits that actually change a thing should be 
active only when the thing is 'picked up' by the mouse.  So now that is the 
case: to add an attribute to goal list you must pick it up first and hit 
'G'.  For an att in an item, you must have picked the item up with the 
mouse cursor over the att you want.
      <p>
#  I did a bit of tidying up internally.  Especially re. the above and also 
about notification of deletion broadcast to panels.
      <p>
#  Previously, something crazy happened on the <a href= 
"panels.html#idp">item details panel</a>: if you hit the 'rid' button on 
the list of antecedents or consequents, you were asked to confirm, but if 
you hit the Delete button, to get rid of the whole item, you were not!  So 
I reversed that.  Also on the <a href= "panels.html#ri">relationship 
instance</a> and <a href= "panels.html#aap">attribute action</a> panels.
      <p>
#  List gadgets that are for related things (rather than for instances of a 
type) now have their 'Rid' button labelled 'Rem' for 'remove from list'.

      <h2><a name="v1.12">
Version 1.12 - November 1999
      </a></h2><!-- -->

#  Various <a href= "bugs.html">Bug Fixes</a>.
      <p>
#  Inference input mechanism (asking the user questions) has been revamped. 
It had been rather complex, leading to a couple of esoteric bugs. 
Rationalised, it is now free from those bugs.
      <p>
#  The server log messages have been changed slightly.  Especially, when a 
KB is removed it reports how many questions the client answered and whether 
of not the session was finished.  So that we can know what sort of use it 
gets.
      <p>
#  Server version now retains the original value of the question in forms 
so that if the user restarts then all their question answers are retained.
      <p>
#  Client of server version can now start inference without reset.  This 
allows a 'default' KB to be provided in which the knowledgeable user need 
only alter a few questions by resetting them.
      <p>
#  <a href= "panels.html#lists">Lists Panel</a> has been tidied up a bit 
with better wording, and has had an extra selection criterion added: 'Those 
in List'.  This allows you, in effect, to perform a relational Intersection 
or Minus of two lists (list A is source, then select list B as InList, then 
the resulting list can be of either those things in both A and B, or those 
things in A that are not in B, depending on the setting of the selection 
bar).
      <p>
#  Panel fonts and gadget sizes now respond a little better to size and 
resolution of screen; but don't get too excited yet!

      <h2><a name="v1.11">
Version 1.11 - October 1999 - The Knowledge Server
      </a></h2><!-- -->

I am issuing a version 1.11 because of a <a href= 
"bugs.html#1.1.zna">bug</a> I have found in version 1.1 of the Knowledge 
Server that could be rather a trouble, though in my version it seems to 
have been harmless.  And another wee <a href= "bugs.html#1.1.wtp">bug</a> 
in the Weights Panel that was a nuisance.  I have taken the opportunity of 
making some other changes that make things rather more useful.  The changes 
since version 1.1 are:
      <p>
      <ul>
<li> Changes to knowledge server (which won't affect local or knowledge 
engineer use):
      <ul>
<li> <a href= "bugs.html#1.1.zna">Bugfix</a>.  The knowledge server log now 
correctly reports the IP address of connecting client.
<li> The attribute results pages of the knowledge server now has a middle 
column that shows whether the antecedent attribute has a positive or 
negative effect on the shown one.  This helps you in investigating the 
knowledge and what-iffing.
<li> On the attribute results pages of the knowledge server there is now a 
hyperlink to click to reset the attribute shown and resume inference.  This 
allows you to change the value of questions you answered earlier, making it 
very easy to investigate the effect of changes in input.
<li> Most pages of the knowledge server have a set of hyperlinks at the 
bottom.  The layout of these has been made more compact, to give a tidier 
appearance.
<li> The title at top of question pages of knowledge server is now part of 
text of question, and not question number.  If you really want to find 
question number, access the Stats page.
<li> Internal changes to the way the knowledge server works so as to 
simplify the message handling part.  In particular, it used to detect a 
flag and if set stop the server; now the called routines simply call 
<code>svStopServer()</code>.  This change was stimulated by a possible <a 
href= "bugs.html#1.1.stop">bug</a>.
      </ul>
      <p>
<li> <a href= "bugs.html#1.1.wtp">Bugfix</a>.  The <a href= 
"panels.html#wtp">Weights Panel</a> now correctly sets all parts of multi-
part weights.
      <p>
<li> Now, when changes are made in the <a href= 
"panels.html#ri">Relationship Instance</a> and the <a href= 
"panels.html#wtp">Weights</a> Panels, these are propagated.  Also, the 
easelpiece of the relationship(s) is now redrawn.
      <p>
<li> Controlling the visual appearance of relationships has changed.  No 
longer can you set the colour of individual rel instances (because in the 
past if you did so then your change could be undone).  And the negative pen 
is now used not only for Negate and Invert unary operations, but whenever 
the effect of the antecedent is inverted, even by e.g. bayesian weights 
being reversed.  This makes it much easier to see what is going on.
      <p>
<li> The <a href= "panels.html#wtp">Weights Panel</a> now has a button to 
return to the <a href= "panels.html#adp">Attribute Details Panel</a> of the 
attribute.
      </ul>


      <h2><a name="v1.1">
Version 1.1 - September 1999 - The Knowledge Server
      </a></h2><!-- -->

The major update to previous versions, and one that makes this 1.1 rather 
than merely 1.093, is the addition of an interface to the Internet so that 
Istar can act as a <a href= "server.html">Knowledge Server</a>.  It still 
acts as a visual programming toolkit, but has a mode in which instead of 
seeking questions from a local user it does so over Internet connections to 
a user's browser.  This should enable its KBs to be available worldwide.
      <p>
In addition, a number of other changes have been made that affect ordinary 
use by the knowledge engineer as well as as a server, the most visible 
first:
      <p>
      <ul>
<li> I have rationalized some of the web page documentation.  Previously, 
all documentation was in this directory (docs).  But there was also an 
Istar web page index.html.  I have now made that, and its server.html, part 
of the fuller documentation.  Also in docs there is technical server 
documentation.  Policy: in docs is technical documentation or documentation 
for the knowledge engineer; in the directory above that is documentation 
aimed at on-line users who might access while running the Knowledge Server. 
I have doen a major revamp on <a href= "panels.html">panels.html</a> 
putting in all the panels I can think of, with examples.  There is now a 
useful <a href= "p.adp.html">imagemap of Attribute Details Panel</a>.
      <p>
<li> Now, if any window does not open (e.g. lack of memory) then you get a 
Beep.  Before just nothing happened.
      <p>
<li> <a href= "panels.html#wtp">Weights Panel</a>.  In the ICT project we 
found setting the bayesian weights a cumbersome operation, especially when 
we wanted to set the weight of one antecedent relevant to others: we had to 
bring up the panel for each <a href= "panels.html#ri">Relationship 
Instance</a> individually.  So we have instituted a single panel showing 
all the weights.  (Actually, not all: as many as will fit on the panel.)
      <p>
<li> The <a href= "panels.html#aap">Attribute Action Panel</a> has had to 
be redesigned.
      <p>
<li> The <a href= "panels.html#adp">Attribute Details Panel</a> has been 
redesigned.
      <p>
<li> The <a href= "panels.html#utxt">User Texts Panel</a> now has two-way 
copy.
      <p>
<li> Documents are now generated from the current goal list, rather than 
(as before) from all items of type <code>Text Fragment</code>.  You can 
also produce documents from all fragments whose attributes are False or 
Unknown rather than True.  The <a href= "doc.html">Documents Panel</a> has 
been changed accordingly.  Also, so allow server to send a document, I had 
to alter the generation a bit so that it did not require the document to be 
currently displayed on an easel to export HTML (a minor oversight in 
previous versions).
      <p>
<li> Redesign of the inference engine (required to allow operation as a 
knowledge server).  The previous version would allow only one inference 
session to proceed at a time (if you tried more than one, then things 
seized up).  Instead of seeing an inference session as a whole process, 
with start, end and points in between where questions are asked, this has 
been broken into little pieces, each being the answer to one question 
followed by the asking of the next.  These pieces from different inference 
sessions can now be interleaved, allowing access by concurrent clients.  In 
the process, a number of things have been rethought and tidied up 
conceptually.  A brief desription of the changes made will be presented at 
the UK Expert Systems 99 conference at Peterhouse College, Cambridge, 
December 1999, and it is hoped a fuller description will appear in Software 
Practice and Experience.
      <p>
<li> I had to revamp slightly the guts of the User Action routines. 
Because I had to combine the Amiga's <code>Wait()</code> with AmiTCP's 
<code>select()</code> using <code>WaitSelect()</code>, but that required 
repackaging ua.c and uaw.c files.
      <p>
<li> If there is not enough memory to open a KB's easel (in normal usage), 
it now gives an error message.  It used not to do so.
      <p>
<li> BUGFIX:  Removed a long-standing memory leak which could occur when 
hitting Quit and letting Istar remove all the KBs automatically (but which 
did not occur when you hit the Rid button for the KB).
      <p>
<li> BUGFIX:  Load two KBs, X,Y.  Then do 'see easel' for X.  Wave mouse 
around and the name window shows items in Y, not X.  After a long time I 
found that aWorkWindow was not set to the proper easel before pgShowWork() 
was called.  It did switch OK, but immediately on a mousemove it switched 
to the Y KB. Corrected that.
      <p>
<li> BUGFIX:  CONTROL rel.  Doesn't seem to work properly. Trees.2.  Infer 
from frost.  And its infce session waits at end for some time (loop?). 
Then frost is not ans.  Now OK.
      <p>
<li> BUGFIX:  Allocation of string values is now OK.  In previous versions, 
we had the following but:  RI panel:  For relshp to cons that is String: 
Change to UO CONTROL, OK,  then bring rel up again, enter string value, OK, 
bring it up again and no sign of string. Various reasons.  Some in RI. 
Some in qqbl.  It was mainly to do with qqAllocVal().  See log:Log.990703.
      <p>
<li> BUGFIX:  String to float conversion now works OK.

      <p>
      </ul>


      <h2><a name="v1.092">
Version 1.092 - Feb 1999
      </a></h2><!-- -->

#  ResetValues.  The main change in version 1.092 is the addition of Reset 
Values to attributes.  These are values stored with each attribute that are 
used when the attribute is asked as a question, either singly or on a form. 
If the attribute has such a Reset Value then it is used to set the value 
gadget on user input.  Previously the attribute took the value it had when 
last used.  Now it can either take that value, or can take a Reset Value 
every time.  The Reset Value is set on the <a href= "panels.html#adp" 
>Attribute Details Panel</a> with two new gadgets next to the User Supplied 
button:
      <ul>
<li> A checkbox to say whether the attribute has a Reset Value.
<li> The Reset Value itself.
      </ul>
If the checkbox is ticked when the user hits the OK button, then whatever 
value is found in the Reset Value gadget is stored at the attribute's Reset 
Value.  If the checkbox is blank then any Reset Value that the attribute 
might have had is deleted.  Attributes normally start without a Reset 
Value, and the gadget takes the value currently found in the attribute's 
value.  At present, only one Reset Value is allowed, but in future you 
should be able to provide any number, each for a different purpose or 
context of use.
      <p>
#  Fixed a bug introduced into version 1.09, in which item instances were 
not linked to their boxgroups.
      <p>

#  All known Enforcer Hits has been removed.  Four were found: a read of 
location 0 when bringing up file requester for first time, a read of 
location 0 when the main easel of a KB was being displayed, and a couple 
which wrote to locations 0x20, 0x28 when creating a new KB.

      <h2><a name="v1.091">
Version 1.091 - Jan 1999

#  Document screen now longer (4 times depth of control screen).
      <p>
#  Document easelpiece now extends almost across whole window.
      <p>
#  Document easel now activated on being shown.
      <p>
#  Fixed the bug that made slider digits switch to same font as question 
text.
      <p>
#  You can now set the Show button on attributes in item types, and then 
when you create an item instance of that type, those attributes whose 
values can be shown (bayesian, boolean, etc.) will be created with value 
lines.  However, a slight bug: these lines do not appear visibly until the 
boxgroup is redrawn, such as by moving it a fraction.  (Up to version 1.09 
you could not switch on the Show button; if you did errors occurred.)
      <p>
#  Reduced vertical spacing of form gadgets to allow more per form.

      <h2><a name="v1.09">
Version 1.09 - Dec 1998 (and unpublished versions 1.087, 1.0871, 1.0872 - 
Oct, Nov, Dec 1998)
      </a></h2><!-- -->
(Versions 1.087, 1.0871 have some of these below; 1.0872 is same as 1.09, 
just renumbered.)
      <p>
#  Documents:  Making up a document is now becoming simpler.  Has own 
panel, complete with ability to export it.  The facility is still rather 
limited, and so is not within the main documentation; it is to be found in 
a <a href= "dyndocs.html" >separate page</a>.
      <p>
#  Preferences.  Before, altering the fonts for questions had no direct 
effect on font actually used; now does.  Also, altering font for document 
was ok - until you zoomed it, then font reverted to main easel font.  Now 
OK.
      <p>
#  Exporting the main easel is now done via the Easel panel.
      <p>
#  Questions asked of user are now logged.  At present, the log file is 
ram:QnLog, which is rather inflexible and you have to copy that file to 
disk if you wish to retain it.  Reason for ram: is because we don't want to 
keep a disk file open for lengthy periods.
      <p>
#  Also, question text now in black rather than white, to enhance 
readability.
      <p>
#  A User Texts facility has been introduced which extends the range of 
user texts available.  This is accessible either from the Attribute Details 
Panel via the 'User Texts' button, or from the User Question panel via the 
Att button.  We now have multiple help texts and also a separate Form text, 
which gives a short text for use on forms.
      <p>
#  Multiple Help Texts.  The main change is that you can give up to 8 
different Help texts, labelled on the User Question Panel 'Help' and '1' to 
'7'.  These can be used for different kinds of Help, such as 'What does 
this question mean?', 'What is the implication of answering this in certain 
ways?', 'What if I say 'unknown'?' and so on.  You can use them as you wish 
- only, remember to tell your users.
      <p>
#  (An internal change that you should know about.)  New SysAtt Identifier 
for the main Help text.  If you have an attribute with help text entered 
under a KB earlier than 1.087, then it will NOT show up when the user 
presses Help.  But, from version 1.0872, you can copy it to the new help 
identifier (that does show up) by entering the User Texts Panel, and using 
the <a href= "panels.html#utxt.temp" >Temporary 'T' Text</a> and the <a 
href= "panels.html#utxt.t.buttons" >T Buttons</a>.  You will find the old 
help text is the Temporary Text.  (Version 1.0871 did not have this concept 
of temporary text, and the only way you could make use of the old text was 
to reply Yes to a special question of whether to convert it to new help or 
not.)
      <p>
#  Topics:  Now have three columns and up to 30 shown.
      <p>
#  The Meaning Bar is no longer obscured by large panels, as it was (with 
Attribute Details, Relationship Instance Details, Preferences, Postscript 
parameters, user question value, user form, help screen, etc.  (Some 
smaller ones still place themselves over it, but you can move them.)
      <p>
#  Question text length.  Was restricted to 256 chars; updated now to 512. 
I've also confined the question box so it does not mess up the value 
gadget.
      <p>
#  Attribute action panel has been made a little safer.  Not only has the 
crash been fixed, but it will not allow you to run up two parallel 
inference sessions with the same attribute!  It warns you so.
      <p>
#  Bugfix:  During an inference session with a goal list, if user hit 
'ResetQ', then only those questions asked during the current goal in the 
goal list were shown.  This has now been fixed, so that all questions of 
the session are shown.
      <p>
#  Bugfix:  Chooser.  If first ante was boolean then Istar would not 
backward chain up the correct one, and would report being unable to answer 
the attribute.  This has now been fixed; see next point.
      <p>
#  Activity of Chooser has been extended beyond integers and booleans in 
the first ante.  If the first ante is boolean or some other truth-valued 
attribute then if false it will take the next (2nd) ante and if true the 
3rd.  (Truth-valued att = boolean, bayesian, probability and odds.)  If not 
a truth-valued att, then it tries to convert it to integer and takes it as 
an integer.
      <p>
#  Bugfix:  Used to Crash when you remove Attribute Action Panel during an 
inference run.  Now, during an inference run or overriding you cannot 
remove the panel.

      <h2><a name="v1.086">
Version 1.086 - March 1998
      </a></h2><!-- -->

This is a small update, mainly to correct a couple of bugs that got in the 
way of our research work, plus one bit of tidying up.
      <p>
#  Bugfix:  If you had an ORDINAL or ENUM antecedent e.g. Weekdays and 
tried to set the <a href="uop.html">unary operator</a> to EqualTo, then it 
would not do so.  Now it does.  (The bug only affected ORDINALs and ENUMs.) 
A reason for doing this is to convert an enum to a boolean saying e.g. 'It 
is Wednesday'.
      <p>
#  When you set the archive flag in the KBInfo panel, so it renames the 
original file on saving, the name the archive received was a clumsy 
datestamp.  I replaced this with a TimesSaved number.  Shorter and nicer.
      <p>
#  Bugfixes:  Inferencing FirstKnown did not allow CONTROL unary operator 
to work.  Also, string concatenation and chooser did not work.  Also, 
HowManyIsIn inference did not work for strings.  These have been fixed.
      <p>
#  Ordinal can now be converted to Proportion, Probability and (the 
probability part of) Bayesian as long as it has a Limit that is non-zero. 
The result is (OrdVal - 1)/(Limit - 1).  The reverse cannot work, however.

      <h2><a name="v1.085">
Version 1.085 - February 1998
      </a></h2><!-- -->
In the past if you selected a GoalList, saved the KB and re-got it again, 
the goal list had to be re-selected.  Now the KB keeps note of current goal 
list.  Note: On some old KBs you will see a rubbish block in the goal list 
slot of the KB Panel.
      <p>
There has been quite a lot of work on inference and unary operators in 
particular, to give the following changes.
      <p>
The relationship explanation facility has not been made more accurate, 
hopefully now addressing the whole range of possibilities.
      <p>
Added unary operators of EqualTo, GreaterThan, etc. which returns a boolean 
result of how the ante value compares with the one on the weight.
      <p>
Now CONTROL type links are not restricted to Boolean antecedents, but can 
take anything that can convert to a BOOL, namely Probability, Bayesian and 
Odds.
      <p>
In bayesian inference, if you have an Odds antecedent, then it will be used 
directly as the odds multiplier; in this way you can exercise direct 
control over bayesian mechanism if you wish.  This gives slightly different 
behaviour from previous versions, in the rare occasions in which Odds 
antecedents were used for bayesian inference.
      <p>
You can now have the ProbAnd and ProbOr unary operators on links for which 
the antecedent is Boolean, in which case the link weight is a Probability 
(or Proportion) and this type is used in the inference.  With ProbAnd, if 
the ante is true, then the value used in inference is a probability equal 
to the link weight, but if the ante is false then the value used is 0. 
With ProbOr, the link weight is applied if the ante is false, and if true 
the value used is unity.
      <p>
The bug in which the NEGATE unary operator did not work for booleans and 
probabilities involved in bayesian accumulation, now works.  In fact, for 
bayesian inference, NEGATE and INVERT are the same.
      <p>
The Relationship Instance Panel now puts up the correct type of gadget for 
the weight - but if you change unary operator then you must 'OK' and bring 
it up again to get the new gadget type.
      <p>
Fixed a rare crash: if you tried to save an easel as IFF and did not have 
iff.library in libs: then it would crash - fixed.

      <h2><a name="v1.084">
Version 1.084  February 1998, but never published
      </a></h2><!-- -->
Found yet another bug that had crept in: if you drew a link in inverse 
direction it looked like inverse, but acted as normal.  The bug crept in 
when I tidied up BA module in October 97.  Fixed.
      <p>
The Attribute Action Panel now activates the main easel once inferencing 
has completed.  It was a nuisance that it did not before.

      <h2><a name="v1.083">
Version 1.083, February 1998
      </a></h2><!-- -->

Unfortunately, version 1.08 went out with a few bugs in it, that crept in 
while I was tidying some internals up.  So I am bringing out this version 
in which they have been corrected; they include:
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>V1.08 crashed when you hit 'Delete' on <a 
href="panels.html#atac">Attribute Action Panel</a>.  Now it doesn't.

<li>If you bring up, say, the <a href="panels.html#adp">Attribute Details 
Panel</a> and hit the Type button, up comes a simple list of types from 
which you can choose.  In V1.08 (but not before) you could then send the 
main panel away and the list remains - and if you then hit its 'OK' button 
Istar would crash.  Corrected.

<li>In V1.08 (and earlier) if something was deleted, but there were panels 
around that referred to it, then not all were removed - which could lead to 
a crash.  Now, if you delete something, and a panel is up that is for that 
thing then the whole panel is removed.  And in most cases, if a list gadget 
refers to it, its entry in the list is removed.

      </ul>
      <p>
I've also added a couple of things that enhance Istar's usability when 
creating KBs:
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>A wee 'Att' button to the User Question Panel, to take KB developers to 
the appropriate <a href="panels.html#adp">Attribute Details Panel</a> so 
they can change e.g. the question text immediately.
      <p>
<li>A wee 'Cons' button likewise, which shows the consequents fan of the 
question being asked, so that you can see what is affected by this 
question.
      <p>
<li>Also, the <a href="panels.html#atp">Attribute Type Panel</a> now 
prompts the user to create a Free Attribute Item Type.  Also warns if there 
is more than one.

      <p>
I removed the Undo button from the User Question Panel since it didn't work 
properly and was not really needed; hit the newly-labelled ResetQ button 
instead (was 'Review').

<h2><a name="v1.08">Version 1.08, December 1997</a></h2>
<!-- -->
      <p>
Since the last version, which never got put out properly, I diverted work 
to the Annotator, which allows historians, space scientists etc. to 
annotate digitized pictures and form a database of their contents for 
analysis.  Much of the same software base is used, but in a slightly 
different way, with more emphasis on standard items of a semantic net form, 
and less of free attributes.  A lot of things were changed and made more 
flexible, and I have taken some of them back across to Istar.
      <h4><a name="warn1.08">
Warning: Check your version
      </a></h4><!-- -->
Unfortunately I released version 1.08 with a couple of unexpected <a 
href="bugs.html#early.1.08">bugs</a> around Christmas 1997 - I wanted to 
give a present!  I've now corrected them and you should have the version 
compiled 3 Jan 1998.  Check the version you have with the CLI command 
<code>VERSION Istar</code> and it should say: <code>Istar 1.08 Jan 3 
1998</code>.  If it gives an earlier date, download the new version.
      <p>
      <h3><a name="html.doc">
Documents in HTML
      </a></h3><!-- -->
The documentation has been rewritten in HTML, with many cross references.
      <p>
<h3><a name="auto.recalc">AUTO RECALC</a></h3>
<!-- -->

In previous versions if you created a new inference relationship between 
attributes they retained their original values.  Now it automatically 
recalculates the value of the destination attribute and propagates it. 
Also, if you redirect a link it recalculates and propagates the values of 
both the original and the new.
      <p>

<h3><a name="lists">LISTS</a></h3>
<!-- -->

(Not to be confused with <a href="#panel.lists">Panel lists</a>, below.)
      <p>
Lists are ordered sets of things in the knowledge base, and you can use 
them for various purposes, and in future even more purposes.  They are 
created via the Lists Panel, which is brought up when you hit the Lists 
button on the KB Panel.  Database-aware people will see they are like 
'relations' in a relational database, that are produced as a result of a 
relational operation.  (NOTE:  In that sentence 'relation' has almost 
*nothing* to do with relationship!  It is a jargon term of the database 
community.)  The purposes for which you might use a List include:
      <p>
<ul>
<li>  Goal Lists.  A Goal List is a list of attributes from which backward 
chaining occurs when you hit the 'Reset Goals' and 'Infer Goals' buttons on 
the KB Panel.  See below.
      <p>
<li>  Volunteer Lists.  A Volunteer List is a similar list of attributes, 
normally question attributes, for which the user gives an answer and then 
their values are propagated throughout the KB.
      <p>
<li>  Override Lists.  Lists of attributes to override for various 
purposes.
      <p>
<li>  Analysis Lists.  These are lists of attributes, items or 
relationships that are in some way meaningful to you, normally for the 
purpose of analysis.  e.g. List of all attributes with more than 4 
antecedents.  e.g. List of all answered attributes.  They are useful 
especially when tracking things down in the KB.
      <p>
<li>  Shown Lists.  You can 'show' any List on the main Easel, hiding all 
things that do not belong to the list.
      <p>
<li>  These are only the start.  In future, you might be able to make up a 
list from items of a given type and then change the type of all of them, 
e.g. when 'vehicles' type must be split into two types 'cars' and 
'bicycles'.
</ul>
      <p>
Lists are formed via the Lists Panel, in a two-step operation which is 
shown on the panel as two long cycle buttons, the width of the panel, and 
various detail gadgets below them:
      <p>
<ul>
<li>  First, the source for the list.  It could be all attributes, items 
and/or relationships, or it could be all instances of a particular type, or 
it could be all members of an existing list, or it could be all those 
linked to members of an existing list.  The last two are equivalent 
respectively to relational select and relational join in database 
terminology.
      <p>
<li>  Second, which of the elements in source to select?  It could be all 
of them, or only those that fulfil certain conditions, or all those except 
them.  The conditions as present are fairly simple: containing a text in 
their names or meanings, attributes that are answered etc., or topological 
conditions.
      <p>
<li>  Third, hit the 'Do It' button, to create the list.
</ul>
      <p>

<h3><a name="goal.lists">GOAL LISTS</a></h3>
<!-- -->

As in version 1.07.  Second column of KB Panel, in the middle, there is a 
three-part gadget which has the name of the current goal list in its 
middle.  Left wee button allows you to select a new goal list from among 
the lists currently in the KB.  Right wee 'S' button will bring up the goal 
lists's Item Details Panel so you can peruse and, if needed, reorder, the 
goals in the list.  Hitting the ResetGoals and InferGoals buttons operate 
of the current goal list.
      <p>
<h3><a name="vol.lists">VOLUNTEER AND OVERRIDE LISTS</a></h3>
<!-- -->

These are similar to Goal Lists, but while Goal Lists normally comprise 
attributes to the right hand side of the Easel, Volunteer Lists comprise 
questions and other attributes to the left and Override Lists comprise 
attributes from the middle.  They are actually treated all the same as far 
as Istar is concerned, it is just that to the knowledge engineer and user 
they have slightly different purposes:
      <p>
<ul>
<li>  Goal Lists:  To start a complete inference process.
<li>  Volunteer Lists:  To provide certain information before the start of 
the inference process.
<li>  Override Lists:  To override some calculations made during the 
inference process.
</ul>
      <p>
To operate a Volunteer or Override List, select it as current goal list and 
hit ResetGoals and InferGoals.
      <p>

<h3><a name="palette">PALETTE</a></h3>
<!-- -->

You can now, albeit clumsily, alter the colours of the main easel.  Hit the 
Easel button down the left of the KB Panel.
      <p>
<h3><a name="visapp">CHANGING THE VISUAL APPEARANCE OF BOXES AND 
ARROWS</a></h3>
<!-- -->

You can now change the colour of boxes and arrows.  Also the line pattern. 
And, for boxes, also the size.
      <p>
      On the Attribute Details, Item Details and Relationship Instance
panels you will find a new line of gadgets giving pens and pattern and, 
maybe, size.  Also DSAP of the EaselPiece concerned.  (Note:  In the Item 
Details Panel, the pens are for the item's own box, which might not be 
displayed.  These will NOT affect the colour of the attribute box of a free 
attribute.)
      <p>
      You can also now change the sizes, which are in 1/256ths of an inch
as on a 14 inch screen (or tenths of a millimetre to within 1%).  Also on 
the ItemType and Relationship Type and Attribute Type Panels.
      <p>

<h3><a name="async">ASYNCHRONOUS QUESTONS: MULTI-THREADING</a></h3>
<!-- -->

In previous versions when you ran an inference process, the user would be 
asked a number of questions in a synchronous manner.  That is, they would 
be asked the first question and answer it, then the second, and so on.  Now 
you make a question asynchronous, in that a panel will be put up for the 
user to give a value for the question, but the backward chaining does not 
stop there.  Instead, it searches for the next question, which might be a 
normal synchronous question (at which it will wait) or another asynchronous 
one.  The user can elect to answer the asynchronous questions at any time. 
This gives a kind of multi-threading flavour to the inference process.
      <p>
      The reason behind this is to get ready for obtaining information
across the internet.  When this happens you want to post a request for the 
information, but not have to wait for its arrival.
      <p>

<h3><a name="qtxt">QUESTION TEXT</a></h3>
<!-- -->

If there is no question text when an attribute value is sought, then it 
will seek meaning text first, then label.
      <p>

<h3><a name="panel.lists">PANEL LISTS</a></h3>
<!-- -->

(Not to be confused with <a href="#lists">Lists</a> facility, above.)
      <p>
Many panel lists, especially of types, attributes and related things, have 
been standardised and made more flexible.  In general, each list now comes 
with a set of small buttons surrounding it, to allow the moving of things 
up and down the list, going to see the selected thing in the list, getting 
rid of a thing in the list, and creating a new thing in the list.  In some 
lists some buttons are missing for e.g. safety reasons.
      <p>
      This provides extra flexibility.  For instance, you can now re-order
the item and relationship types if you wish, and also the attributes of an 
item.
      <p>
<h3><a name="add.att">CAN ADD ATTRIBUTES AT ANY TIME YOU WANT</a></h3>
<!-- -->

In older versions you could not (easily) add an attribute to an item after 
it was created; you could only add one to its item type and then create a 
new instance.  Now you can add any attribute to any item - instance as well 
as type - at any time.  And it should take care of its visual appearance.
      <p>
      What this means is that some instances of a given type might have
extra attributes (and some have less).  This can be useful when you might 
have e.g. sub-types emerging during your analysis.
      <p>

<h3><a name="rel.atts">RELATIONSHIP INSTANCES HAVE ATTRIBUTES</a></h3>
<!-- -->

Relationships instances can now be given attributes, in addition to the 
normal weight.  For this the RelInst Panel has an 'As Item' button which 
brings up an Item Details Panel treating the Relationship as an Item. 
There you may add attributes.
      <p>

<h3><a name="new.att.panels">ATTRIBUTE TYPES - NEW PANELS</a></h3>
<!-- -->

The creation and subsequent manipulation of attribute types has been made 
easier, and the old Attribute Types Panel has been made into two or three. 
The Attribute Types Panel itself is merely a list of attribute types, 
available when you hit the Att Types button on the KB Panel, and you can 
hit its See or the New or Rid buttons.
      <p>
      When you hit the See button an Attribute Type (singular) Panel comes
up, which has name, meaning, visual appearance gadgets as above, and list 
of value names for ENUMs and ORDINALs.
      <p>
      To create a new attribute type, a small panel comes up, showing steps
the user must go through - give it a value type, give it a name and a 
meaning.  Then the Attribute Type Panel appears (sometimes) for you to 
enter more details.
      <p>
<h3><a name="cutoffs">LOWER AND UPPER CUTOFFS</a></h3>
<!-- -->

These have been moved internally.  What this means is that any KBs in which 
they are active (which be very few) will find them no longer active and 
they will have to set them again.
      <p>

<h2><a name="v.107">Version 1.07, March 1997</a></h2>
<!-- -->

#  LISTS FACILITY.
I plan, next version, to have a Lists facility which will allow you to form 
lists of items, atts, relationships according to various selection 
criteria, including manual addition, and then to use any list as a goal 
list, and to perform simple relational-database-like operations with lists, 
such as selection, union, intersection, join.
      <p>
#  Goal Lists.  In previous versions you had precisely one goal list.  Now 
you can make up any number of goal lists, using the lists facility above, 
so that, for instance, you can have a main goal list plus several override 
lists on which you can do common what-if queries.
      <p>
#  Better file handling.  With previous versions when you asked for an 
ascii dump of a KB, the default file to which it would output the ascii was 
the KB file itself !!.  Danger of losing all your work!  Problem was that 
there was only one file requester allocated for all file output.  I've now 
got different requesters for:
<p>
<ul>
<li>  knowledge base load and save
<li>  Prefs file load and save
<li>  KB ASCII export
<li>  text and easel dump
</ul>
      <p>
#  VGA screens.  Previous versions of Istar gave a PAL screen regardless of 
Workbench.  Now its screen mode is that of WorkBench.  (However, in VGA 
mode some of the control screen panels are a bit odd-sized; this will be 
fixed soon.)
      <p>

<h2><a name="v1.06">VERSION 1.06, February 1997</a></h2>
<!-- -->

#  Attribute Details Panel:  If you change the value of a Constant 
attribute then it sets the value to answered and propagates it when you hit 
OK.  It used not to do this, and that meant that sometimes the new value 
would not take effect immediately.
      <p>
#  Keys.  First, you can now show the consequent fan/net as well as the 
antecedent one.  Press 'C' over a box for the consequent and 'A' for 
antecedent.
      <p>
#  Keys.  Second, it will now show all kinds of relationship in the 
antecedent and consequent fans, not just inference.
      <p>
#  Keys.  Third, I've changed the keys used.  For two reasons.  One is that 
when used on a CD32 with SX32 keyboard there are no keys around the numeric 
keypad and the other is that I could never remember which keys were used. 
So I now use alphabetic keys that bear some resemblance to the action 
needed:
      <p>
<ul>
<li>  A = Antecedent fan
<li>  C = Consequent fan
<li>  R = Related one step in both directions
<li>  T = To This Type (as before)
<li>  M = minimize or maximize a box size
</ul>
      <p>
#  Minimize/Maximize box size.  A new facility.  Some boxes are of little 
intrinsic meaning, merely being minor variants on the meaning of others. 
Often you get a local bunch of antecedents that merely set the value for a 
more important box.  So now you can minimize these less important boxes by 
hitting the 'M' key when the mouse is over them.  This turns them into 
little squares, quarter of an inch square and with not label - a bunch of 
these starts to look like a bunch of blackcurrants.  Their meaning still 
shows, however, and you can do all the normal things to them.  Then, if you 
hit 'M' again over a minimized box it expands to its normal size.
      <p>
#  In Attribute Details panel, if att is a Const in derivation and you 
alter the value then it is set to answered.  And the result is propagated. 
Because it is assumed that you are altering it for a purpose.
      <p>
#  On using a large KB (ca. 800 boxes and 400 arrows) and a goal list about 
100 long it took around 3 seconds to reset all the goals on a basic Amiga 
1200.  (Because all the consequent fans of all reset attributes have to be 
traversed.)  A noticeable delay, though not unreasonable for a KB of this 
size and complexity.  I investigated the time taken (3.3 seconds on basic 
Amiga 1200 and 1.4 seconds on Amiga 1200 with 50MHz 68030) and checked that 
the algorithm was working OK and not doing more work than it need to (it 
was OK).  There might be ways of speeding it up slightly.  But at present 
it is not high priority; 1.4 seconds delay seems perfectly reasonably for a 
KB this size when the subsequent question sequence is around 40 questions 
long.
      <p>
#  Bug in Chooser was fixed.  It now resets attribute to unanswered every 
time.
      <p>
#  Wee Bugfix.  When you added an attribute to an item that had an att with 
shown value it didnae do it right - placing the 2nd on top of the first. 
It now does it right.
      <p>

<h2><a name="v1.05">VERSION 1.05, January 1997</a></h2>
<!-- -->

#  (It's rather nice:  The better Istar becomes, the smaller it becomes!)
      <p>
#  Instituted an initial dynamic document facility.  You create Document 
items and the document is created dynamically from 'Text Item' items whose 
'Include' attributes are true.  See Item Details Panel.  The facility is at 
present very crude, just so you can start to try it out.  See the new 
'Dynamic Documents' file.
      <p>
#  Found bug that stopped Istar being used on the 4000 and 3000 - and 
corrected it.
      <p>
#  You can now add new attributes to existing item instances (you could add 
to item types before, but not instances).  e.g. if the standard 'Cat' item 
type has attributes of Name, Has-Whiskers, Colour and Sound-Made, and you 
make instance 'Susie', with attributes: Has-Whiskers = TRUE, Colour = Grey, 
Sound-Made = Miaow, before, that was all you could record about Susie.  But 
now you can add any new attributes you like without affecting the item 
type.  So you can enter Number-Of-Legs = 3 (she got run over!).
      <p>
#  You can also re-order attributes now in both item types and item 
instances.
      <p>
#  You can now read and write preferences files.
      <p>
#  I went through all the modules with a fine tooth comb, making some 
internal changes (specifically, replacing rbDataAddr() with ikDataAddr(), 
etc.).  In particular, some of the old code made the wrong tests after a 
routine returns a C pointer.  Took the opportunity to rationalize the error 
handling and error messages.
      <p>

<h2><a name="v1.041">VERSION 1.041, November 1996</a></h2>
<!-- -->
      <p>
#  Found a bug had crept into Version 1.04 that prevented changing value 
types in Attributes Details panel.  So corrected it.
      <p>
#  Also, internal changes to the way text of labels is displayed.
      <p>
<h2><a name="v1.04">VERSION 1.04,  November 1996</a></h2>
<!-- -->

#  Added the CONTROL Unary Operator.  See 'Using Istar'.  This allows 
attributes to be made 'not applicable' if another one is answered with 
False.  See new version of 'Using Istar' document.
      <p>
#  Lots of work allowing you to set Preferences ...
      <p>
#  Will now read IstarSys:IstarPrefs, if available, when starting up to set 
various preferences.  An IstarPrefs_LowMem is supplied.
      <p>
#  Can now change fonts for the main easel, the user questions and the 
document.  (Note: document facility still not available.)
      <p>
#  The Preferences panel now has KB and font information as well as Easel 
info, and it only sets the sizes for new KBs, not the existing one. 
(Scroll amount is set for all KBs and Easels, though.)  This makes it 
easier to prepare for a low memory situation.
      <p>
#  Added facility to switch tracing on in the command line.
      <p>
#  Changing the size of a currently displayed Easel is now done from a new 
'Easel' button on the KB Panel, not from the Preferences panel.
      <p>
#  A wee change: Before, on hitting 'Quit' it would first ask "Do you want 
to quit?" and then ask for each KB "Do you want to get rid of it?"  Now it 
asks about all the KBs first, and then "Quit?"  This allows you to clear 
out all the KBs but not quit the program, so to start other KBs again.
      <p>
#  A button on KB panel 'See Easel' will bring the easel of that KB to the 
front; useful when you have several KBs up.
      <p>
#  Tidied up all panel handling.  Users shouldn't see any difference, but 
it makes a bit smaller.
      <p>
#  New documentation file, KBs, which outlines all manipulation of whole 
knowledge bases, and IstarPrefs file.
      <p>
#  Resizing of a KB is now possible, but occasionally fragile; see Bugs and 
Limitations.
      <p>
#  When saving a KB you can now have automatic backups made of the file: 
see KBs document.  The old file is not overwritten, but has date and time 
appended to it.
      <p>
#  Slight improvements to the Explanation of Relationship Instances.
      <p>

<h2><a name="v1.03">VERSION 1.03,  September 1996</a></h2>
<!-- -->

#  Made Istar more usable for drawing semantic networks.  Two main 
facilities:
      <p>
#  Added facility to alter the visual appearance of item boxes, in a 
limited way.  Pen 1 gives the text colour for the label, Pen 2 and Pattern 
give the appearance of the box outline.  This meant new gadgets added to 
the Item Type Panel.
      <p>
#  Added facility to define, for an item type box, which types of 
relationship will be drawn when user starts drawing from left or right 
edge.
      <p>
#  Added KB Area panel, showing some details of the KB area, and allowing 
you to alter some.
      <p>
#  Tidied up the mechanism for handling several KBs.  Removed one or two 
bugs that had crept in, such as referring to certain things in KB1 when KB2 
was active.
      <p>
#  Added facility to record the Control Screen Parking position.
      <p>
#  Hopefully more tolerant when it doesn't find the fonts it wants.
      <p>
#  Cured one or two bugs encountered when linking items or moving links.
      <p>
#  Tidied up Preferences (but still too few), and cured the problems that 
happened when setting them without a KB.
      <p>
#  Removed the crash/inf loop when hitting the meaning-bar right hand 
gadgets when there is no KB.  (As I never told users about them, this 
should not have been a problem.)
      <p>

<h2><a name="v1.02">VERSION 1.02,  July 1996</a></h2>
<!-- -->

#  Placed on Aminet first as /misc/misc without install script, and then 
with proper install script and updated docs in /biz/misc.
      <p>
#  Istar will now process more than one KB.
      <p>
#  It meant replacing the separate Select Item Type, Select Relationship 
Type and Goal List panels with a single single KB panel.  Each knowledge 
base has its own KB panel.
      <p>
#  It also meant some internal changes to the structure of the modules 
management, ES module operations, and other things, which are not described 
here.  (They are described in my Logs.)
      <p>
#  I also put the backward and forward chaining on a sounder footing. 
Normally it worked OK but some funnies happened with overridden attributes.
      <p>
#  When resetting an attribute for backward chaining, all its antecedents 
were reset OK, but the other consequents of those were not reset.  Now they 
are.
      <p>
#  Implemented facility to define new relationship types.  This enables us 
to move towards a semantic net builder.
      <p>
#  Added RANDOM unary operator.
      <p>
#  Proper implementation of limits on ordinals and enums.
      <p>

<h2><a name="v1.01">VERSION 1.01,  June 1996</a></h2>
<!-- -->

This was the first version released.  It was a development of the KBTools 
software that came out of the INCA project, with a year spent on making its 
code more robust and generalized.  Istar works fairly well and robustly as 
an inference net builder.  But it can only process one KB at a time.
