<h1>ISTAR</h1>
<!-- -->

This is the starting page for documentation about Istar.  This 
documentation explains what Istar is, how it works, how you can use it to 
build knowledge bases (KB) in the role of a <a href= 
"../index.html#kg.eng">knowledge engineer</a>, and how you can make those 
KBs available on the World Wide Web as a <a href= "server.html">knowledge 
service</a>.  If your interest is as a user of such KBs (maybe you got here 
from a link on a page sent by the Istar Knowledge Server) then you are 
advised to read the <a href= "../index.html">more general introduction to 
Istar</a>.
      <p>
(Istar is the new name for what used to be called KBTools.  KBTools was 
considered a rather boring name, so we have substituted one that is rather 
corny, and perhaps cheeky, if you are a Tolkien addict.)


<h2><a name="what">WHAT IS IT?</a></h2>
<!-- -->

A package for building knowledge based systems and then running them.  It 
is of the inference net kind, with both backward and forward chaining.  It 
is similar to the rule based kind but more flexible.
      <p>
      KBSs make inferences from input information.  Usually running them
involves asking the user a sequence of questions until enough information 
is gathered to come up with an answer.  Microsoft Wizards are a simple 
version of this.


<h2><a name="how">HOW TO USE IT</a></h2>
<!-- -->

There are two levels at which to learn to use Istar as a knowledge 
engineer: 'driving' the features of the software and using it to do 
something be useful to you.  These are explained in the files:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="driving.html">Driving Istar</a> (including installation)
<li><a href="using.html">Using Istar - Inference</a>
<li><a href="using.sn.html">Using Istar - Semantic Nets</a>
</ul>

<p>

Read them when you are ready to start.  In addition the following files 
give more detailed information:
<p>
<ul>
<li>  <a href="kbs.html">KBs</a>
<li>  <a href="panels.html">Panels</a>
<li>  <a href="inference.html">Inference</a>
<li>  <a href="value.types.html">Value Types</a>
<li>  <a href="history.html"></a>
<li>  <a href="bugs.html">Limitations and Bugs</a>
      <p>
<li> <a href= "server.html">The Istar Knowledge Server</a>
<li> <a href= "server.mgmt.html">Managing the Istar Knowledge Server</a>
<p>
<li>  <a href="rfman.html">Reference Manual</a>
</ul>
<p>
There is still much documentation to be written, and not all the facilities 
of Istar are explained in the above files.  But Istar should be reasonably 
robust, so you can experiment.


<h2><a name="why">WHY ISTAR: WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT IT?</a></h2>
<!-- -->

#  Graphical input.  Most KBS software require you to <i>write</i> your 
rules or inferences using text such as:
<p>
<code>
      IF ?requested_class = PENICILLINS
<br>  AND Patients_age >= 0.8*Allowable_age
<br>  THEN Patient's age is acceptable for the new drug.
</code>
<p>

which is sensitive to syntax errors.  But with Istar you <i>draw</i> your 
inference graphically, as boxes and arrows.  Then, at your convenience, 
fill in the detail.  A true 'visual programming language'.  (Some KBS 
software such as NExpert can display a box and arrows diagram that has been 
entered textually, but with Istar the main extry medium is drawing.)
<p>

#  Smooth user interface.  Most software that allows you to draw box and 
arrows diagrams is clumsy.  For instance, to link two boxes:
<p>
<ul>
<li>  Click on Box1.
<li>  Mouse up to Toolbar or Menu
<li>  Select 'Link boxes'
<li>  Click on Box2.
<li>  (Draws straight line between them that crosses others)
<li>  Mouse up to Toolbar or Menu
<li>  Select 'Bend link'
<li>  Click on position of bend
<li>  etc.
</ul>

<p>

In Istar you start drawing from edge of Box1, hitting space wherever you 
want bends and releasing over Box2.  No menues or toolbars in sight.  The 
difference is even more marked when you want to redirect a link from one 
box to another.
<p>


#  For knowledge generation.  This means the user interface actions do not 
interrupt your flow of thinking as you express your knowledge.  Just as "an 
architect thinks with his pencil" so you can "think with the mouse".
<p>


#  Easy exploration of KB.  Hit 'a' or 'c' over a box, and all others 
connected to it even indirectly are shown - so you can find out what input 
information is will have an effect on a given item.  Also Find by Name etc.
<p>


#  Range of types.  Normally you are offered integer, float, string and 
perhaps dates.  With Istar you get other types too: probabilities, 
bayesians, proportions, ratios, odds, directions, and several others.  In 
Istar we attach the semantics to each type (e.g. in ratios and odds, the 
greatest common divisors are automatically cancelled out).  Others to be 
added soon, such as IFF bitmap, anim, sound sample.
<p>


#  Range of useful inference methods.  Not just add, subtract, multiply, 
divide, AND, OR, but also things like Chhoser, First-Known, First-OK, 
Number of Answered, Concatentation, Is-In, etc.
<p>


#  Kernel written in assembler, for speed and robustness.
<p>



<h2><a name="plans">WHAT'S PLANNED?</a></h2>
<!-- -->

The current version of Istar is the current output of a continuing 
development process.  In future you will have scripts, demons, ARexx, 
dumping of the KB to PROLOG, etc.
