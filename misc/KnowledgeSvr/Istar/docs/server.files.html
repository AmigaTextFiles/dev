Istar Server Ancillary Files
      </h1><!-- -->

For the Istar Knowledge Server to run properly, you must have the following 
files in the <code>IstarSys:files/ </code> directory (drawer).  At present, 
assume all are mandatory, because quite a number of them hold HTML code and 
structure.  In future I hope to rationalise them.
      <p>


<li> A set of files from which HTML pages are created:
      <ul>

<li> <code>htmlhead</code> - HTML code to start a new page, up to title.
<li> <code>htmlend</code> - Text to be added at the end of most pages; 
currently just a reference to Istar itself and the HTML ending code.
<li> <code>htmlwelcomestart</code> - Starting text of Welcome Page - 
preceding the list of KBs.
<li> <code>htmlwelcomeend</code> - Text to end Welcome Page, after the list 
of KBs.
<li> <code>htmlnotes</code> - Notes to be added before the end of most 
pages; currently instructions on what to do on a question page.
<li> <code>htmlh0</code> - Heading for main help text of each question.
<li> <code>htmlh1..7</code> - Headings for subsidiary help texts 1..7
<li> <code>htmlhelppage</code> - HTML page for Help that is not specific to 
any question.
<li> <code>htmlstoppage</code> - HTML page to respond to user's 'stop' 
signal.
<li> <code>htmlwelcomedet</code> - HTML text (e.g. H3 heading) that 
introduces the details of the KBs (long descriptions) on the welcome page.
<li> <code>htmlresults</code> - Text to say that the inference session has 
stopped and results are available.  Body text at start of the What-Now 
page.
      </ul>

<li> The following contain error messages or pages (you MUST have these 
files):
      <ul>
<li> <code>htmlbad</code> - Error message page saying that Istar did not 
understand what your browser sent; perhaps you had modified the URL?
<li> <code>htmlbadkbfile</code> - Error message page saying that Istar 
could not load the KB file indicated in the KBDetails set up from the 
<code>serverkbs</code> file.
<li> <code>htmlbadkbid</code> - Error message page saying that Istar does 
not have the KB indicated in the message sent from your browser; perhaps 
you had modified the URL, or were using an old Welcome Page that you had 
cached?
<li> <code>htmlfull</code> - Error message telling client that Istar 
currently has its quota of clients.
<li> <code>htmlnogl</code> - Error message page saying that the KB selected 
does not seem to have a Goal List; If this happens it means that the server 
KBs have been wrongly chosen, which is a fault at the server end.
<li> <code>htmlnokbc</code> - Error message page saying that Istar cannot 
obtain a <code>kbControl</code> structure for the KB.
<li> <code>htmlnodoc</code> - Body text to tell user that there is no 
document available.

      </ul>
