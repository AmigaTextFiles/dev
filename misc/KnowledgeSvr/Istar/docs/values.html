<h1>VALUE TYPES</h1>
<!-- -->

In this version you are provided with the following basic value types from 
which you can make attribute types.

<h3><a name="">Integer</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>Numeric for whole numbers
<li>Range: -billion to billion (normal 32 bits)
<li>Held as:  32 bits
<li>Coding:  simple signed binary number
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Floating point</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>Numeric for floating point numbers
<li>Range: normal 32 bits
<li>Held as:  32 bits
<li>Coding:  normal exponent and mantissa
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Ratio</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>Numerator and denominator, both can be signed
<li>Used for any ratio
<li>Range:  Each part has range of full integer.
<li>The ratio can represent infinity by holding denominator = 0
<li>Held as: Two 32 bit integers
<li>Coding:  Two simple signed binary numbers; Infinity when denominator = 
0
<li>In most manipulations, the greatest common divisor is removed (so if 
you multiply 4/7 by 14/15 you get 8/15)
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Odds</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>Numerator and denominator, both positive
<li>Used especially for odds and conversions to and from probability
<li>Used for bayesian multipliers
<li>Range:  Each part has range 0 to 65k
<li>Held as: Two unsigned 16 bit words
<li>Coding:  Two simple unsigned binary numbers; Infinity when denominator 
= 0
<li>In most manipulations the greatest common divisor is removed
</ul>

<h3><a name="">String</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>Any string
<li>Range: up to 200 characters in length at present
<li>Held as: child 'Sysatt' block with as much space as needed
<li>Coding:  ASCII
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Boolean</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>Truth value: yes or no, true or false
<li>Range:  true or false
<li>Held as: unsigned 16 bit word
<li>Coding: 0 = false, anything else = true
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Probability</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>0 to 1 (0 to 100%) for soft truth value
<li>Range:  0 to 1
<li>Held as:  Unsigned 16 bit word
<li>Coding: 0x0000 means 0, 0xffff means 1
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Bayesian</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>Probability used for evidential reasoning
<li>Has a-priori and lower and upper cut-offs
<li>Range:  Part as probability
<li>Held as:  Four probabilities
<li>Coding:  As probability, four times
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Proportion</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>Represents a proportion 0 to 100%
<li>Used for anything that requires a limit of 100%
<li>Range:  0 to 100%
<li>Held as:  Unsigned 16 bit word
<li>Coding: 0xffff means 100%
<li>In many things proportion and probability are interchangeable
</ul>

<h3><a name="">OZMO</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>
 (one-zero-minus-one, e.g. result of cosine)
<li>Like a proportion that can go negative as well as positive
<li>Used for e.g. degrees of belief, degrees of dislike
<li>Range:  -1 to 0 to 1
<li>Held as:  Signed 32 bit word,
<li>Coding: 0x80000000 means -1, 0 means 0, 0x7fFFffFF means 1
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Direction/Angle</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>
 (0 to 360 degrees)
<li>A circular value which represents proportion round a circle
<li>Used for angles, directions, etc.
<li>Range:  0 to 360 degrees (2.pi radians)
<li>Held as:  Unsigned 16 bit word
<li>Coding:  0x0000 = 0 and 360 degrees. 0xffff = just before 360, 90 
degrees = 0x4000, 180 degrees = 0x8000, etc.
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Enumerated Type</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>An index number for selecting an entity from a set
<li>See also Ordinal, which is ordered
<li>Strictly, numeric comparisons and operations meaningless, but in 
practice allowed as for Ordinal
<li>Range:  strictly meaningless
<li>Each value is expected to have an attached string name
<li>Held as:  Unsigned 16 bit word
<li>Coding:  0 means 'nothing selected', 1 upwards shows selection
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Ordinal</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>An index number for selecting an entiry from a list
<li>See also Enum, which is unordered
<li>Numeric comparisons and operations meaningful
<li>Range:  1 to 65k
<li>Each value can be linked to an attached string name
<li>Held as:  Unsigned 16 bit word
<li>Coding:  1 = first in list, 2 = second, etc.  0 = 'nothing selected'
</ul>

<h3><a name="">Block</a></h3>
<!-- -->
<ul>

<li>The DSAP of a block in the KB
<li>Used for identifying things in the KB and e.g. getting name of it
<li>Its value must never be altered as it is like a pointer
<li>Range:  strictly meaningless
<li>Coding:  32 bit relative pointer
</ul>
