                      Documentation for indexer v1.0.


1. Introduction.
===========================================================================

Why  did  I  wrote  indexer  ?  Why  not  :-).  Well, I write program (like
dictionary)  which  manages  lot  of  files  (528  files - about 200 KB). I
formatted  disk and copied these files on it (it took only (?!) about... 15
minutes  (?!).  Next  I looked at DirOpus panel and saw that there was only
about  288  KB free on the disk ! Why ? Yeah, each of files takes few bytes
extra  space  (like FileInfoBlock). Don't worry - indexer can help you :-).
The  main  purpose  of  this  tiny  program  is  to save the disk space and
increase  efficiency  of disk access. Have you ever tried to copy 528 files
from  HD to floppy ? Just press the "Copy" gadget and have a trip with your
dog :-).


2. How does indexer work ?
===========================================================================

Don't  care...  Indexer  will join all files into one big file and generate
description file. For example:

  indexer Work:many_files big_file index 100000

would  join  all  files which exist in directory "Work:many_files" into one
big file "big_file" and generates description file "index". I/O Buffer size
(here is 100000 bytes) is default 50 KB.


3. What is on the earth "description file" ?
===========================================================================

Description  file is text file and helps your routine (you should write one
for  your  own) to read necessary file from "big file". There will be 3
lines per file as presents below:

filename
filesize
offset


4. I have only AmigaOS1.3...
===========================================================================
Wise  guy  !  Unfortunatelly,  indexer  doesn't  run  under  your Kick :-(.
Although,  you  can  replace function FPrintf() which is v36+ and recompile
code  (don't  forget  to  remove  line:  extern LONG __OSlibversion = 36;).
Indexer  was  tested  on  my  A1200 with Kick 3.0 inside and I hope it runs
under AmigaOS2.0, too.

5. Cleanup.
===========================================================================

I  hate read and write "DISCLAIMERS" notes. There is source (SAS/C 6.50) of
indexer in archive. Look at it if you want and ask yourself "Could be there
any  bug  which  would format my hard drive ?". If you like indexer send me
e-mail  and  tell  me  about  it. Sorry about grammar mistakes, but english
isn't my native language.
