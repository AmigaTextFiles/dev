DESCRIPTION
   The class is a Reggae demultiplexer for BMP streams (pictures). Object of
   bmp.demuxer class has two ports: port 0 is an input and accepts
   MMF_STREAM format, port 1 is an output and produces MMF_VIDEO_BMP format.
   The class is a direct subclass of multimedia.class.


NEW ATTRIBUTES
   MMA_Video_FrameCount   (V50)   [..G.Q], *UQUAD
   MMA_BlockAlign         (V51.6) [..G.Q],  ULONG
   MMA_StreamPosBytes     (V51.6) [..G.Q], *UQUAD


NEW METHODS
   MMM_Pull(port, buffer, length)  (V50)
   MMM_Seek(port, type, offset)    (V51.6)


HISTORY
   51.6 (29.01.2007)
   - Added MMA_BlockAlign attribute (stream offset to pixmap data) used by
     bmp.decoder for workarounds for decoding buggy images.
   - Added missing OM_GET and MMM_GetPort entries to the dispatcher.
   - Implemented MMM_Seek().
   - Added MMA_StreamPosBytes attribute.
   - Recognition routine: if header filesize does not match filesystem
     filesize, does not set probability to 0. Allows lot of broken images to
     be accepted.

   51.5 (08.01.2006)
   - Fixed Setup(), should return TRUE when called on the output port.

   51.4 (13.06.2005)
   - Fixed broken recognition routine (peeking into random port).

   51.3 (04.05.2005)
   - Removed debuglog output.

   51.2 (20.04.2005)
   - Added debug info in the destructor.

   50.1 (24.10.2004)
   - Initial revision.


bmp.demuxer/MMA_BlockAlign

NAME
   MMA_BlockAlign (V51.6) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
   This attribute is used internally to pass pixmap data offset from
   beginning of the stream, as specified in the header. This offset is used
   by bmp.decoder as a helper for decoding broken images.


bmp.demuxer/MMA_StreamPosBytes

NAME
   MMA_StreamPosBytes (V51.6) [..G.Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
   Current position in BMP encoded data in bytes (after stripping 14-byte
   BMP file header).


NOTES
   As every 64-bit attribute, MMA_StreamPosBytes is passed by pointer to a
   64-bit value.


bmp.demuxer/MMA_Video_FrameCount

NAME
   MMA_Video_FrameCount (V50) [..G.Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
   As BMP format does not support multiframe images, this attribute returns
   1 always.


NOTES
   As every 64-bit attribute, MMA_Video_FrameCount is passed by pointer to a
   64-bit value.


bmp.demuxer/MMM_Pull

NAME
   MMM_Pull -- Writes Windows BitMap data to specified buffer. (V50)


SYNOPSIS
   ULONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG
   length);


FUNCTION
   Pulls needed amount of stream data from input, processes them to extract
   raw Windows BitMap data and places them in the specified buffer. The
   demuxer is pass-through for image data (no data copying).


INPUTS
   obj - object to perform method on.
   port - number of port, must be output (1).
   buffer - destination buffer for bitmap data.
   length - amount of data to be pulled in bytes.


RESULT
   Number of bytes pulled, secondary error information via MMA_ErrorCode.

   multimedia.class/MMA_ErrorCode


bmp.demuxer/MMM_Seek

NAME
   MMM_Seek -- Seeks in encoded BMP data. (V51.6)


SYNOPSIS
   ULONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Seek, ULONG port, ULONG type, UQUAD*
   offset);


FUNCTION
   Seeks in encoded BMP stream, as the demuxer does no data conversion it
   only adds main BMP header size to the offset, and passes the method
   to the input port (it is then forwarded to the connected stream object).


INPUTS
   obj - object to perform method on.
   port - number of port, must be output (1).
   type - seek type, must be MMM_SEEK_BYTES.
   length - absolute position in BMP encoded data in bytes.


RESULT
   Boolean success value.


NOTES
   The offset is passed as a pointer to 64-bit unsigned number.
