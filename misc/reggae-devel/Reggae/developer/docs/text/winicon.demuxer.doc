DESCRIPTION
       The class is a Reggae demultiplexer for Windows icon format (*.ico
       files). The demuxer supports 4 and 8-bit icons with palette and
       24-bit and 32-bit truecolor icons. Any size up to 256 x 256 is
       handled, not neccesarily square. Icon image mask is supported as well
       as alpha channel in 32-bit icons. The demuxer handles multiple icon
       images by creating separate output for every image. Then every output
       can be queried about image size and colour depth, and image data
       fetched. Number of outputs may be obtained by getting MMA_Ports
       attribute and substracting one. The object input is port 0 always and
       accepts MMF_STREAM format. Ports 1 to N (where N is the number of
       images in the stream) are outputs and produce MMF_VIDEO_BMP format.
       The class is a direct subclass of multimedia.class.


NEW ATTRIBUTES
       Attributes applicability:
         I - may be set at creation time.
         S - may be set on an existing object.
         G - may be get from an object.
         P - may be set for an object's port.
         Q - may be queried from an object's port.

NEW METHODS
       MMM_Pull(port, buffer, length)  (V50)


winicon.demuxer/MMA_Video_BitsPerPixel

NAME
       MMA_Video_BitsPerPixel (V50) [....Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
       Returns image colour depth. Possible values for winicon.demuxer are
       4, 8, 24 or 32.


winicon.demuxer/MMA_Video_FrameCount

NAME
       MMA_Video_FrameCount (V50) [....Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
       As Windows icon format does not support multiframe images, this
       attribute returns 1 always.


NOTES
       As every 64-bit attribute, MMA_Video_FrameCount is passed by pointer
       to a 64-bit value.


winicon.demuxer/MMA_Video_Height

NAME
       MMA_Video_Height (V50) [....Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
       Returns height of image frame in pixels.


winicon.demuxer/MMA_Video_Width

NAME
       MMA_Video_Width (V50) [....Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
       Returns width of image frame in pixels.


winicon.demuxer/MMM_Pull

NAME
       MMM_Pull -- Writes Windows BitMap data to specified buffer. (V50)


SYNOPSIS
       ULONG DoMethod(Object *obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG
        length);


FUNCTION
       Pulls needed amount of stream data from input, processes them to
       extract raw Windows BitMap data and places them in the specified
       buffer. The demuxer is pass-through for image data (no data copying).


INPUTS
       obj - object to perform method on.
       port - number of port, (1 to N, where N is the number of images in
         the stream).
       buffer - destination buffer for bitmap data.
       length - amount of data to be pulled in bytes.


RESULT
       Number of bytes pulled, secondary error information via
       MMA_ErrorCode.
