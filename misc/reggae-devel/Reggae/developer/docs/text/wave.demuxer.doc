DESCRIPTION
   The class is a Reggae demultiplexer for WAVE (*.wav) sounds. WAVE format
   has many subformats and wave.demuxer will select matching decoder. The
   demuxer extracts header information ans passes sound data to the next
   processing stage. The demuxer recognizes following subformats:
     - type 1, uncompressed integer PCM,
     - type 3, uncompressed floating point PCM,
     - type 6, CCITT A-law PCM,
     - type 7, CCITT mu-law PCM,
     - type 17, IMA/DVI ADPCM,
     - type 85, MPEG-1 Audio Layer III.

   Port 0 (input) accepts MMF_STREAM.
   Port 1 (output) produces one of:
     - MMF_AUDIO_PCM8U (type 1, 8-bit)
     - MMF_AUDIO_PCM16LE (type 1, 16-bit)
     - MMF_AUDIO_PCM24LE (type 1, 24-bit)
     - MMF_AUDIO_PCM32LE (type 1, 32-bit)
     - MMF_AUDIO_PCMF32LE (type 3)
     - MMF_AUDIO_ALAW (type 6)
     - MMF_AUDIO_MULAW (type 7)
     - MMF_AUDIO_IMA_ADPCM (type 17)
     - MMF_AUDIO_MPEG (type 85)

   wave.demuxer is direct subclass of multimedia.class.

HISTORY
   51.5  (18.11.2006)
   - Added support for IMA ADPCM subformat.
   - Added MMA_BlockAlign internal attribute.

   51.4  (08.01.2006)
   - Fixed seeking bug in SeekChunk(): current chunk position was not
     updated.

   51.3  (15.11.2005)
   - Fixed error forwarding in MMM_Pull.
   - Fix in ReadChunkBytes(), MMM_Pull is not called if data size is 0.

   51.2  (06.06.2005)
   - Added support for type 6 (CCITT A-law PCM) and type 7 (CCITT mu-law
     PCM).

   51.1  (05.06.2005)
   - Type 3 (floating point PCM) streams return 32 as
     MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample, 25 was misleading, as it didn't represent
     dynamic range properly.
   - Seeking implemented.

   50.5  (08.12.2004)
   - Separate MMM_Setup for every port.

   50.4  (26.11.2004)
   - Support for WAVE type 3 (floating point PCM).

   50.3  (22.11.2004)
   - WAVE MPEG-s are handled (using mpegaudio.decoder).

   50.2  (16.11.2004)
   - Implemented MMA_DataFormat.

   50.1  (23.10.2004)
   - Initial revision.


wave.demuxer/MMA_BlockAlign

NAME
   MMA_BlockAlign (V51) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
   Additional information for some of subformats. Used internally by
   some decoders.


wave.demuxer/MMA_DataFormat

NAME
   MMA_DataFormat (V50) [..G.Q], STRPTR


FUNCTION
   Returns read-only textual NULL-terminated description of decoded format.
   The description depends on WAVE subformat.


wave.demuxer/MMA_MediaType

NAME
   MMA_MediaType (V51) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
   Returns media type of object. All objects of wave.demuxer class return
   MMT_SOUND always.


wave.demuxer/MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample

NAME
   MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample (V50) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
   Specifies number of significant bits in a single sound sample as found in
   the header.


wave.demuxer/MMA_Sound_Channels

NAME
   MMA_Sound_Channels (V50) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
   Specifies number of channels in WAVE stream as found in the header.
   Reggae can process up to 256 channels (streams with more channels will be
   rejected). Subformat channel limit is usually lower than that.


wave.demuxer/MMA_Sound_FrameCount

NAME
   MMA_Sound_FrameCount (V50) [..G.Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
   Returns number of sample frames in the stream as specified in the header.


NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not by
   value.


wave.demuxer/MMA_Sound_SampleRate

NAME
   MMA_Sound_SampleRate (V50) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
   Specifies sampling rate of WAVE stream as found in the header, measured
   in sample frames per seconds. Any integer value is accepted, but note
   that output devices (as well as many filters) may not accept extremely
   high values.


wave.demuxer/MMA_Sound_Volume

NAME
   MMA_Sound_Volume (V50) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
   Specifies default sound volume relative to the maximum one. Range of this
   attribute is from 0 (silence) to 65536 including (full volume). Current
   version of wave.demuxer does not recognize any WAVE chunks containing
   volume information so this attribute returns 65536 always.


wave.demuxer/MMA_StreamPosFrames

NAME
   MMA_StreamPosFrames (V51) [..G.Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
   Returns current absolute stream position in sample frames.


NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not by
   value.


wave.demuxer/MMA_StreamPosTime

NAME
   MMA_StreamPosTime (V51) [..G.Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
   Returns absolute stream time position in microseconds. This time position
   is strictly based on MMA_Sound_SampleRate, and reflects only the whole
   sample frames already pulled from the object output. The exact formula
   is:

   time_pos = whole_frames_pulled / MMA_Sound_SampleRate


NOTES
   This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not by
   value.

   Returned time is not in any way related to playback time for two reasons:
   firstly, there can be an unknown number of buffers between the
   demultiplexer and the output, secondly, playback samplerate may be
   different than those specified in the stream header.

wave.demuxer/MMM_Pull

NAME
   MMM_Pull -- Loads a block of encoded data to a buffer. (V50)


SYNOPSIS
   bytes = DoMethod(obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG length);


FUNCTION
   Loads specified number of bytes of WAVE encoded data into the buffer. As
   the class does not process the data, it does not copy them, just passes
   them through.


INPUTS
   - obj, object to perform the method on.
   - port, number of port is always 1 (the output port).
   - buffer, a memory buffer for pulled data, must be aligned to 16-byte
     boundary (preferrably allocated with MediaAllocVec()).
   - length, amount of pulled data in bytes.


RESULT
   - bytes, number of bytes pulled actually.


SEE ALSO
   multimedia.class/MediaAllocVec()


wave.demuxer/MMM_Seek

NAME
   MMM_Seek (V51)


SYNOPSIS
   success = DoMethod(obj, MMM_Seek, ULONG port, ULONG type, UQUAD*
   position);


FUNCTION
   Performs seek in PCM stream as found in WAVE file. As wave.demuxer object
   knows samplerate and frame size, only frame seek and time seek are
   supported.


INPUTS
   - obj, object to perform the method on.
   - port, number of port is always 1 (the output port).
   - type, seek type (MMM_SEEK_FRAMES, MMM_SEEK_TIME).
   - position, new, absolute position in the stream. For frame seek it is in
     frames, for time seek in microseconds. It is 64-bit parameter passed by
     a pointer to the value. Note that it is not playback time, see
     MMA_StreamPosTime for explanation.


RESULT
   TRUE if success, FALSE otherwise. Check MMA_ErrorCode for detailed
   information.
