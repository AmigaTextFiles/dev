DESCRIPTION
       The class is a Reggae demultiplexer for Audio IFF uncompressed sound
       files. It extracts header information and passes data to the next
       processing stage, usually audiopcm.decoder. The object has two ports.
       Port 0 is an input and accepts MMF_STREAM. Port 1 is an output
       producing one of:
         - MMF_AUDIO_PCM8
         - MMF_AUDIO_PCM16BE
         - MMF_AUDIO_PCM24BE
         - MMF_AUDIO_PCM32BE
       The aiff.demuxer class is a direct subclass of multimedia.class.

aiff.demuxer/MMA_DataFormat

NAME
       MMA_DataFormat (V50) [..G.Q], STRPTR


FUNCTION
       Returns read-only textual NULL-terminated description of decoded
       format. All aiff.demuxer objects return "Audio IFF" string.


aiff.demuxer/MMA_MediaType

NAME
       MMA_MediaType (V51) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
       Returns media type of object. All objects of aiff.demuxer class
       return MMT_SOUND always.


aiff.demuxer/MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample

NAME
       MMA_Sound_BitsPerSample (V50) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
       Specifies number of significant bits in a single sound sample as
       found in the header. Note that it can be any number from 1 to 32
       bits, but samples are always padded up to byte boundary.


aiff.demuxer/MMA_Sound_Channels

NAME
       MMA_Sound_Channels (V50) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
       Specifies number of channels in AIFF stream as found in the header.
       Reggae can process up to 256 channels (streams with more channels
       will be rejected).


aiff.demuxer/MMA_Sound_FrameCount

NAME
       MMA_Sound_FrameCount (V50) [..G.Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
       Returns number of sample frames in the stream as specified in the
       header.


NOTES
       This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not
       by value.


aiff.demuxer/MMA_Sound_SampleRate

NAME
       MMA_Sound_SampleRate (V50) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
       Specifies sampling rate of AIFF stream as found in the header,
       measured in sample frames per seconds. AIFF format allows for
       fractional rates (as sample rate is stored as a floating point
       number). Such fractional rates are rounded down to the nearest
       integer. Any integer value is accepted, but note that output devices
       (as well as many filters) may not accept extremely high values.


aiff.demuxer/MMA_Sound_Volume

NAME
       MMA_Sound_Volume (V50) [..G.Q], ULONG


FUNCTION
       Specifies default sound volume relative to the maximum one. Range of
       this attribute is from 0 (silence) to 65536 including (full volume).
       As AIFF streams have no volume information, an aiff.demuxer object
       returns 65536 always.


aiff.demuxer/MMA_StreamPosFrames

NAME
       MMA_StreamPosFrames (V51) [..G.Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
       Returns current absolute stream position in sample frames.


NOTES
       This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not
       by value.


aiff.demuxer/MMA_StreamPosTime

NAME
       MMA_StreamPosTime (V51) [..G.Q], UQUAD*


FUNCTION
       Returns absolute stream time position in microseconds. This time
       position is strictly based on MMA_Sound_SampleRate, and reflects
       only the whole sample frames already pulled from the object output.
       The exact formula is:

       time_pos = whole_frames_pulled / MMA_Sound_SampleRate


NOTES
       This is a 64-bit attribute passed by pointer to UQUAD variable, not
       by value.

       Returned time is not in any way related to playback time for two
       reasons: firstly, there can be an unknown number of buffers between
       the demultiplexer and the output, secondly, playback samplerate may
       be different than those specified in the stream header.

aiff.demuxer/MMM_Pull

NAME
       MMM_Pull (V50)


SYNOPSIS
       bytes = DoMethod(obj, MMM_Pull, ULONG port, APTR buffer, ULONG 
         length);


FUNCTION
       Loads specified number of bytes of PCM data into the buffer. The 
       length of data is rounded down to the nearest sample frame boundary,
       bytes past this boundary are undefined. As the class does not process
       the data, it does not copy them, just passes them through.


INPUTS
       - obj, object to perform the method on.
       - port, number of port is always 1 (the output port).
       - buffer, a memory buffer for pulled data, must be aligned to 16-byte
         boundary (preferrably allocated with MediaAllocMem()).
       - length, amount of pulled data in bytes. Will be rounded down to the
         nearest sample frame boundary.


RESULT
       - bytes, number of bytes pulled actually.


aiff.demuxer/MMM_Seek

NAME
       MMM_Seek (V51)


SYNOPSIS
       success = DoMethod(obj, MMM_Seek, ULONG port, ULONG type, UQUAD*
         position);


FUNCTION
       Performs seek in PCM stream as found in Audio IFF file. As
       aiff.demuxer object knows samplerate and frame size, only frame seek
       and time seek are supported.


INPUTS
       - obj, object to perform the method on.
       - port, number of port is always 1 (the output port).
       - type, seek type (MMM_SEEK_FRAMES, MMM_SEEK_TIME).
       - position, new, absolute position in the stream. For frame seek it
         is in frames, for time seek in microseconds. It is 64-bit parameter
         passed by a pointer to the value. Note that it is not playback
         time, see MMA_StreamPosTime for explanation.


RESULT
       TRUE if success, FALSE otherwise. Check MMA_ErrorCode for detailed
       information.
