SetDisplayBottom24() has been modified slightly to attain compatibility
with the AA Chip set. There will now be a blank line between the opal
and amiga graphics to allow execution time for the longer copper lists 
required for AA, this will cause a line of the palette colour to be
trashed when running v1.0 of opalpaint, future versions will shift
the palette up 1 line.
