   Split 1.3 autodoc files into individual subroutine files. One file is
created for each subroutine. The file name is created by appending ".doc"
to the subroutine name. This allows me to define an alias to view any
subroutine man page. Example:

	alias md run less hd0:docs/[].doc

To view the doc file for the Wait subroutine, I type:

	md wait


	usage:  docsplit [-pstr] [-v] [-o] [-?] [file ...]

	Options:

	pstr - Path to output directory. Default current.\n");

	v    - verbose - display all file names.\n");

	o    - overwrite existing files.\n");

	?    - display this list.\n");
