       MkMake V1.45 -- A tool for generating makefile automatically.

      (c) Copyright Anders Hybertz, April 1992, Freely Distributable.


INTRODUCTION

	Have you ever been looking at your current programming project,
	and thinking, it's about time to generate at makefile, to speed up
	the compiling time.

	Well, I have been there a couple of times, and then, in a bright
	moment, I thought, how about a program that does this work for you.

	At first, I was satisfied when it created a simple makefile, but
	soon I discovered, that much of the work in generating makefiles,
	could be done automatically.

	This version is the first public release. It works, but still there
	is a lot of work to be done, before it reaches the final release.

	This version is programmed with SAS-C in mind, but the next releases
	will add better support for other compilers, such as DICE-C,
	GNU-C. I also want to translate it to other platforms, like
	PC and UNIX-workstations like Sun and HP.

	At this state, you only have to change the makefile a little, before 
	it fits	your compiler.

USAGE
	It's very simple to use MkMake, so I won't write a lot of text,
        telling about the program, bit by bit. This is only an explanation
	of the options.

	Usage:	MkMake -{sdiqxtcyla} [Project name] > Makefile

                If there is no [Project name], the default is [a.out]

	Options:

        	-s	This option, uses environment variables instead of
			SASCOPTS. The program looks in ENV:cenv/ for the
			variables.
			This version support environment variables for:

			PRG		= Project name

                        ASM		= Your assembler
			ASMOPTS 		= Your assembler options
                        ASMDEFINES	= Your assembler defines

			YACC		= Your yacc compiler
			YACCOPTS	= Your yacc compiler options

			LEX		= Your lex compiler
			LEXOPTS		= Your lex compiler options

                        CC		= Your c compiler
                        LINKER		= Your linker
			LCFLAGS		= Your c compiler flags
                        DEFINES		= Your c compiler defines
			BLINKFLAGS	= Your blinker flags
			LIBS		= Libs to add your linker
                        STARTUP		= Your startup code


			If this flag is not activated, MkMake reads the
			SASCOPTS file.

        	-d      Just update file-dependencies. If you create a new
			file, the makefile scans the files again, to see
			what have changed. Just updates lines under #!¤**

                -i      Automatically generate prototype files, with help
			from MkProto. The prototypes is saved in
			<filename>.i

		-q	Tell LMK to be quiet.

		-x	Don't exit the makefile when fx. the compiler
			returns with an error.

                -y 	Find/compile yacc files, in current dir.

		-l	Find/compile lex files, in current dir.

		-a 	Find/compile assembler files, in current dir.

	In this version, some of the options is not implemented yet, so they
	are not discribed.

DISTRIBUTION

    	MkMake may be freely distributed, as long as no charge is made other
    	than to cover time and copying costs. If you want to include MkMake
    	as part of a commercial package, contact the author listed above.

HISTORY

VERSION 1.40 -> 1.45

	Now MkMake parse the -P and all the -t options from SASCOPTS.
	-P is the Project Name wich is copied into PRG.
	-t is the startup code. I now support all 5 modes from SASCOPTS,
	even the special mode, where you can use your own startup code.

	I also made a new variabel wich is LIBPATH. Standard initialisation
	is LIB:. 

	Rewritten the LINKER string. It now uses the WITH option, so
	BLINK can read as many files as you want. Before this was a big
	problem, because BLINK would hang, if you parsed to many files to
	it. The PRECOMPOBJ has been deleted. I don't use it anymore.

	Added a version-string, so you can get the version number of MkMake.
	Just type <version MkMake>.

	Added support for Workbench startup.
		At the moment I support 2 Tooltypes for MkMake.
		
		OPTIONS: enter the options like you did in CLI.
			 EX:  OPTIONS=-s , for sascopts exclude.
			 EX:  OPTIONS=-al, for asm & lex files.

		MAKEFILE: enter the name of your makefile, and 
			MkMake dumps it's output to this file.
			EX:   MAKEFILE=LMKFile
		
		When started from Workbench MkMake opens at little window
		in the top left corner. When it is finished, MkMake
		closes the window. I know that it's ugly, but if I
		removed it, you would never know, when it was finished.
		In the next release, I remove this window, and do
		some fancy stuff instead. 

	Some minor things rewritten.

	No longer OS1.3 compatible. :-(

	Thanks to Lars in Bergen (Norway) for these suggestions.



FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

	* At this moment I don't want to do a lot of work on MkMake, 
	  because SAS institute, soon release version 6.0 of their 
	  C compiler. If is't as good as they say, nobody will use
	  MkMake, but if they don't support the features of MkMake,
	  I have some great ideas for improvement. 

	* On of them, is an environment like HP's SoftBench. 
	  
	* At the time I am working on an option, which makes
	  it possible to do parallel compiling. If the programs can
	  be compiled under the same rules ex. '.c.o', I can't see
	  why I can't compile then in parallel. So if you have
	  a fast machine, lot of ram and a fast HD, I can reduce
	  the compiling time.
