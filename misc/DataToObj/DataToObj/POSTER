[ Tested with Manx 3.6a. Seems to work, though the sample program included
  in the readme file gurus. A "printf" worked just fine. -- Peter ]

 This is my weekly program submition to amiga-sources :-). It converts raw data
files to object modules, nothing spectacular but I needed something like this
but didn't find it on the net and even on fish disks.
 Hope somone else may find it useful too..
