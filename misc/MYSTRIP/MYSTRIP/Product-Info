Strip symbol/debug hunks from executable
.description
This little program tries to strip all symbol and debug hunks from
an AmigaDOS EXECUTABLE. It DOES NOT WORK on gcc object (.o,.a) files !
As GCC adds many symbol (and debug) infos even to the AmigaDOS
executable and there ist actually no debugger around, that could use
these informations, it's probably a good idea to remove these infos.
They don't carry ANY information, the executable needs to be run.
