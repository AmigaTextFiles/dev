		MYSTRIP V1.0
               ==============

This little program tries to strip all symbol and debug hunks from
an AmigaDOS EXECUTABLE. It DOES NOT WORK on gcc object (.o,.a) files !
As GCC adds many symbol (and debug) infos even to the AmigaDOS
executable and there ist actually no debugger around, that could use
these informations, it's probably a good idea to remove these infos.
They don't carry ANY information, the executable needs to be run.

The program: 
------------
Included is the source and the executable (mystrip.c, mystrip)
Simply call it as follows: 
	mystrip in [out]
It reads "in" and write the stripped executable to "out".
If "out" is not given, stdout is used.

Well: NEVER type: mystrip foo foo, as this will kill "foo"!

The program prints out the numbers of symbols stripped, if "out" is given.

I tested it on several executables, including cc1, gcc, sed, awk, etc.
No error ever occured.
Nontheless: NO WARRANTY IS GIVEN, that this program will work probably!
            So, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!

The Source is included and may be changed by anyone.
Indeed is this program a more quick-and-dirty hack and could be enhanced
quite a bit.
