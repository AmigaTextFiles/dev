General Description:


    First:

    CloseWd is an OS 2.xx only tool. That means it doesn`t run under
    Kickstart 1.2 and 1.3.

    An usual problem: There is a program which has been finished but its
    window is still stayed open.

    To get rid of all those forgotten windows you can use now CloseWd.

    CloseWd [CW] first opens its window with several gadgets on it.

    By using one of the supported ways you are able to chose the window
    you want to be closed.

    CW has a gadtools user interface. For each gadget exists an equivalent
    key you can press instead of clicking on a gadget.

System Requirements:

    You need at least OS 2.xx version 37L. Version 36 missed some features.

Legal Stuff:


This program and all files come with it also the docfiles are released
as FREEWARE.

this means:

    everybody may use CloseWd,

    everybody may copy CloseWd, if:

        1. you copy all included files see list below
        2. no changes are made , this means the program amd all included files
            must stay in the origin form. Exception: you may archieve it ; but
            in this way you must also archieve the whole package.
        3. if you recompile it, you have to include a notice to the original
            author. if you also want to (re)distribute in this form you have to
            send me a copy.
        4. you may not sell CloseWd
                except:   you`re allowed to take a small copy fee which
                            may not extend 5$.
        5. if you want to include CloseWd or one of the included files as a part
            of a commercial package, you must have written permission of the
            author (address see below)


I take no warranty or guaranty for the function of this program.
The whole risk of using it stays by the user.




Installation:

CloseWd can be started either from CLi or from WBench.

If you want to start CloseWd mainly via Cli you should copy it
into your C: directory or in any other directory in your current
AmigaDOS searchpath.

If you will instead start CW mainly via WBench you can copy
CW to any place just by dragging its icon to the drawer you
want CW to be located.


Using CloseWd:

When CW starts it will open a window which contains several gadgets.
There are two kinds of looking for the window you want to be closed.


1. By activating the window:

    Therefor you must activate the Time gadget or type 'i'.
    You can specify here a delay time by type in the value into the
    Wait gadget. Then CW waits the given time in seconds before starting
    the search process for the activated window.
    If you e.g. want to close a window on another screen than WBench,
    it can take a time to bring this screen to front and activate the
    correct window. If you have specified a time value of 20 sec. CW
    waits 20 seconds before starting the search.


    Take Care:

          It will always delayed until the given time is finished.
          There is no way to break this delay time. All other instructiones
          in this time will be absolutely ignored. When the time delay has
          been finished, the screen will flash. You should take care not
          to activate any other window before you see the flashing or the
          wrong window may be closed.


2. By specifying the name of the window:

    Therefor you must type in the first chars of the window title in the
    Title string gadget.
    If CW finds a match for the name the found window will be closed.


CloseWd has just another useful option, the ask option.
To use this option you must activate the Ask gadget (the hook must appear).
The ask option supports both kinds of window selection. If activated CW
asks now for confirmation before closing any window.

The 'Okay try to ....' gadget will start the search.
With 'Cancel und Quit' you can end the program.

Instead of clicking a gadget you can press the underline key of each gadget
label.

Instead clicking on the zip gadget (Iconify) you can type 'z'. The same
procedure a second time will bring up the window to the old position and
resize it to the old state.

Instead of using the close gadget you can type 'q'.


WARNING:

* You must not close windows which are still be used by another program or
* application.
* This can lead to system crashes. You should ever use the ask option.
* You should never use CW while another program is still reading or writing
* something to a disk or harddisk, because you can never be sure if a window
* is not still be used by another program or task. In this case you may lose
* datas.

Cli-Parameters

Starting CloseWd via CLI you can specify the following arguments:


Syntax: CloseWd [Title][ASK/S][DELAY/N]

    with

        Title       specifies the title of the window gadget which will be displayed
                    when CW first opens.

        ASK         if you specify ASK the ask gadget is activated when CW starts

        DELAY       you can specify the number which will be displayed in the
                    wait gadget when CW first starts.



Technical:          CloseWd doesn`t use a ListView gadget to display all
                    opened windows. The allocation of a list and the nodes
                    would takes too much time and results on a larger code
                    size.
                    CloseWD uses the new features of the DOS and GadTools.
                    libraries.
                    CW was compiled with the Aztec C Compiler Version 5.2a.


Last:

        I hope there is no need to use CloseWd very often. Because CloseWd
        is only used when another program has a bug and cannot close its
        opened windows by itself while termination.

        Nevertheless I hope this is a useful program.

        If there are any BUGS in this program please let me know


        Have fun ...
