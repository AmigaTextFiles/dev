Program for creating version numbers.
.description
MakeVersion is a simple program for creating program version
numbers. I use it to embed version numbers in most of my
publicly-released programs. It creates linkable object files
which can be used by any standard Amiga linker when linking
the program and is particularly suitable for use in Make
files (or Lmk or DMake files).
