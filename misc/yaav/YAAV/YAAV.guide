   Just copy the whole drawer to a location in your harddrive.
   Before YAAV is run you MUST configure it by changing the tooltypes. This can be done by clicking on
the YAAV icon and then pressing @{i}RightAmiga-I.@{ui}

YAAV accepts the following tooltypes to set its preferences:

   @{b}AUTODOCS=@{i}@{ub}path_name@{ui}   Set the directory where your Autodocs reside.
                        Default is DOCS:

               @{b}@{fg highlight}  MENUS @{ub}@{fg text}

@{b}Project@{ub}

   @{u}-Iconify@{uu}
      Iconifies YAAV. Hit L-alt L-shift y to bring back.

   @{u}-About@{uu}
      Brings up version information

   @{u}-Quit!@{uu}
      Quits


@{b}Doc Settings@{ub}

   @{u}-Edit document list@{uu}
      Pops up a small window that lets you manage your document lists.

   @{u}-Select from document list@{uu}
      If on, then you get a sorted list of all your Autodocs instead
      of a file requester. This list appears inside the DocList Window.

   @{u}-Use parse caching@{uu}
      If on, then the parse data for each document you load will be cached to
      memory. Next time the AutoDoc is loaded it will not be re-parsed. This
      speeds up YAAV considerably when you're switching a lot between different
      AutoDocs! (i.e. I get a 2 second delay on my machine when loading
      intuition.doc. This delay goes away when caching is on).

      @{i}(NOTE: The AutoDoc itself is not saved to memory. Only the function names
      and offsets are cached)@{ui}

   @{u}-Create pre-parse file@{uu}
      This will load all the AutoDocs in your AutoDoc list, parse them and save
      the parse cache to a file called parse.cache. This file will be loaded and
      data transfered into the cache each time YAAV is run. (This option will
      not do anything if parse caching is off.)

   @{u}-Flush pre-parsing cache@{uu}
      This causes the cache to be expunged from memory.


@{b}Extras@{ub}

   @{u}-Remake dictionary@{uu}
      Selecting this will cause all your include files to be rescaned and the
      dictionary to be re-made. This can take a while....

@endnode

@node "mainwin" "mainwin"

               @{b}@{fg highlight} MAIN WINDOW@{ub}@{fg text}


   @{b}Library Name@{ub}

      Type in the name of a library/device/resource etc, without the .doc
      extension, to take a look at its function list. (ATTENTION:
      Case-Sensitive) Alternatively, click on the 'F' Button to pick a document.


   @{b}Function Name@{ub}

      Type in the name of a function to view (it must be in the current Autodoc)
      Alternatively, pick a function from the listview below.
    (ATTENTION: Case-Sensitive)


   @{b}Cross-Reference Docs@{ub}

      Enabling this feature will let you cross-reference other Autodocs and
   include files from within the viewer window. If this feature is disabled then
   you will only be able to hyperlink to entries in the same Autodoc


   @{b}Use Dictionary@{ub}

      This feature lets YAAV create a dictionary of system structures and
   constants.

   Then you will be able to reference any system constant/structure from within
   the viewer window by simply clicking on it. The Cross-Reference feature must
   be enabled for this to work.

      NOTE: With a 'standard' set of include files the dictionary
   takes up around 120K of disk space.

@endnode

@node "viewerwin" "viewerwin"

               @{b}@{fg highlight} VIEWER WINDOW@{ub}@{fg text}

 This is the window that you will be staring at most of the time. It displays the selected function
reference of the current AutoDoc. It is not just a passive window. You can click in it and do stuff
:)


   @{b}Retrace@{ub}

      Retrace your steps in history :)


   @{b}Referencing Functions, Includes and system structures@{ub}


   -It  is  possible  to  look  at  other  functions  in the Autodoc by simply
   clicking on them in the main text:

   -By enabling the  "Cross-Reference  Docs"  feature,  clicking on names of
   functions or include files within the viewer window will make YAAV
   automatically open the corresponding Autodoc and display the referenced
   function, or include file.

   -If you also have the Dictionary feature enabled, the Dictionary will be
   searched for the corresponding system structure or constant and the
   associated Include will be opened in an editor window.

   -Include  files,  however will NOT be opened within the viewer window - the
   C:ED command will be called instead.

@endnode

@node "editwin" "editwin"

              @{b}@{fg highlight} EDIT DOCLIST WINDOW@{ub}@{fg text}


This window is used to manage your collection of AutoDocs in a relatively easy way. (Rather like a
primitive version of the AutoDocViewer(tm) groups)

   @{b}Add Dir@{ub}

   - Pops up a requester for you to select a directory. This is then scanned
   non recursively for filenames ending in .doc. No further checking is done
   when scanning directories in this way. The resulting filenames are added to
   the document list. Because YAAV uses a single path for actually reading the
   autodocs you are advised to set this to a system assign and set that one to
   all the directories in which you have AutoDocs using the ADD option of the
   assign command.


   @{b}Clear List@{ub}

   - Clears the current document list


   @{b}Save List@{ub}

   - Lets you save the current list.


   @{b}Load List@{ub}

   - This adds the files from a previously saved list to the current one.


@node "doclist" "doclist"
               @{b}@{fg highlight} DOCLIST WINDOW@{ub}@{fg text}

This window can be used as an alternative way to select Autodocs. In order to get to this window you
must have the Select From Document List menu option enabld. Then you can use the @{b}@{u}F@{ub}@{uu} gadget in the main
window to display the Document List. This will initially be empty. You can create and modify lists
using the Edit DocList window, accessible from the Doc Settings menu.

 Dictionary bugs
 ---------------

   -Some include file definitions are not parsed correctly by the dictionary
   creator:

      +Constructs like:
         typedef struct {
            ....
            block;
            ...
         }name;

      are not parsed. This @{i}might@{ui} make it impossible to reference some structures.


      +Comments are not ignored...


   -These should be fixed for V1.00


 Not really a bug, but will be fixed
 -----------------------------------

   -Your editor must be named ED.  The only editor port that messages are sent
   to is rexx_ced. Yet another bugfix for V1.00


               Bug reports
               ===========

   -AFAIK there are no other bugs. At least no serious ones. The program has
   been tested with Enforcer and Mungwall and it appeared stable.

   -Naturally, I'd appreciate it if you can find more bugs :)

R1.25    */=--V0.99--=/*

         typedef struct{ ..block }name; is still not parsed, however.

         -Fixed ReMake Dictionary menu item
         -Minor bugfixes

R1.23
         -If the DocViewer window was not the last opened window then mouse

   * Extension of parsing

      - The $0C code will no longer be required:  parsing will be done by going
      through  the  Table  Of Contents (so far there has only been one AutoDoc
      that did not use the $0c code:  the storm_wizard.doc - so its not really
      necessary).


   * Support for multiple AutoDoc locations

      - Currently only all AutoDocs must reside in a single directory, or you
      must set the tooltype to an assign and then use Assign <name> <dir> ADD
      to add more directoris to that assign. Currently using an extended assign
      is the only way to support multiple AutoDoc directories..


   * Maybe change the look of the program... but in what way?
