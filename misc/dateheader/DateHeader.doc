		     DateHeader

	   Automated Date Header for C

   ----------------------------------------------------------------

   For AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04, or 3.0.

   This is a very simple program that produces a small include
   file that contains the current date in the format specified
   by the Amiga User Interface Style Guide. The exact format of
   the include file is as follows:

	/********************************************
	 date.h
	 Automatic Date Header
	 Created by DateHeader, a program by
	 Russ Steffen.
	********************************************/

	#define __AMIGADATE__ "(25.02.93)"

	#define __CREATION_DATE__ "Thursday, 25 February 1993"

   So, to create an automatically updated version string in your
   programs, use something like the following:

   #include <date.h>
   const char vers[] = "MyProgram Vxx.x " __AMIGADATE__

	INSTALLATION

   Installing DateHeader is trivial. Just copy DateHeader into C:, or
   wherever you like. Then, add the line:

     DateHeader >ENV:date.h

   to your startup-sequence or User-Startup. That's it. Now, every time
   you boot, the header file for the current day will be created. Now,
   all you have to do is make sure that your compiler can find the header
   file.

   One last item, for people who leave their machines on all the time. If
   you are running a cron-type utility, I suggest adding DateHeader to your
   crontab file to run nightly, thus insureing that the DateHeader is always
   accurate. Or, you can just add it to your makefiles.
