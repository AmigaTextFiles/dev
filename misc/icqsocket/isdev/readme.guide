@node is "What is this??"

 @{u}Introduction@{uu}

 "Add a user interface and you have an ICQ client!"

 This is a pre-release with very little documentation, hope you can figure
 out how it works anyway.

 Note that I have nothing to do with Mirabilis, and the protocol
 implemented by this library is based on the unofficial specification
 created by various people on the icq-devel mailinglist.
 Therefore this library is not 100% compatible with the Mirabilis servers,
 and using it to access their ICQ network may not be entirely legitimate.

 ICQ is a registered trademark of Mirabilis (www.mirabilis.com).

 @{u}License@{uu}

 The library is totaly free to use for FREEWARE and PUBLIC DOMAIN
 applications. Authors of shareware or commercial applications must contact
 me for licensing.

    which is almost larger (measured in bytes) than ICQSocket.library is...

@node nt "Notes on ICQSocket"

 * The current version contains a lot of debug information. To activate
   debugging execute the following:

	is_Debug(Output(), 0);

   Before your program exists you must turn of debugging:

	is_Debug(NULL, 0);

   Setting the second parameter (Flags) to 2 will make ICQSocket log all
   packets sent/recieved in a file in RAM:.

 * Configuration files are stored in T: in this pre-release. Future
   releases will store them somewhere else.

 * Read the example sources and the header file.
   That's the only 'documentation' available at the moment.

   The examples were compiled with SAS/C 6.58.

   LogView shows how to read the message log.

   RegNewUser shows how to register a new account.

   TestLib shows how to log in to the server, how to read the databases,
   how to recieve messages etc.

 * Send questions & bugreports to hki@hem1.passagen.se.
