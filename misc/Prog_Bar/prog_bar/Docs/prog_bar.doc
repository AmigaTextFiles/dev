CreateProgBarA() / CreateProgBar()
----------------------------------

NAME
        CreateProgBarA -- Allocates and initialises a progress bar.  (V1.0)
        CreateProgBar -- Varargs stub for CreateProgBarA().  (V1.0)

SYNOPSIS
        bar = CreateProgBarA ( Wnd, Left, Top, Width, Height, Size,
                               taglist )

        PBAR *CreateProgBarA ( struct Window *, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD,
                               UWORD, struct TagList * )

        bar = CreateProgBar ( Wnd, Left, Top, Width, Height, Size,
                              First_Tag, ... )

        PBAR *CreateProgBar ( struct Window *, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD, UWORD,
                              UWORD, Tag, ... )

FUNCTION
        Allocates  a  new  PBAR  structure,  initialises  it  to the default
        values,  or  any  values  specified  in  the function call, and then
        renders the progress bar to the specified window.

INPUTS
        Wnd     - A pointer to the window in which the progress bar is to be
                  rendered.
        Left    - The X position of the progress bar.
        Top     - The Y position of the progress bar.
        Width   - The Width of the progress bar.
        Height  - The Height of the progress bar.
        Size    - The  logical  size of the progress bar.  This is the value
                  represented  by  the full bar.  It is not connected to the
                  visual dimensions of the progress bar.
        taglist - A   pointer  to  an  array  of  tags  specifying  optional
                  parameters which will modify the behaviour of the progress
                  bar.  If the default values are all that are required this
                  can  be  NULL.  See SetProgBarAttrs() for more information
                  about the various tags available.

RESULT
        bar - If successful these functions will return a pointer to the new
              progress  bar.   This  pointer  should  be  kept as it will be
              needed  to  identify  the  progress  bar  for  all  the  other
              functions.   These  functions  will only fail due to a lack of
              memory, in which case the returned value will be NULL.

SetProgBarAttrsA() / SetProgBarAttrs()
--------------------------------------

NAME
        SetProgBarAttrsA -- Changes  the  behaviour  or  appearance  of  the
                            progress bar.  (V1.0)
        SetProgBarAttrs -- Varargs stub for SetProgBarAttrs().  (V1.0)

SYNOPSIS
        SetProgBarAttrsA ( PBar, taglist )

        void SetProgBarAttrsA ( PBAR *, struct TagList * )

        SetProgBarAttrs ( PBar, First_Tag, ... )

        void SetProgBarAttrs ( PBAR *, Tag, ... )

FUNCTION
        Changes  the  behaviour  or  appearance  of  a  progress bar to that
        specified  by  the optional tags.  It will perform all the necessary
        calculations and redraw the display.

INPUTS
        PBar    - A  pointer to the progress bar to be altered.  This is the
                  pointer returned by CreateProgBar().
        taglist - A  pointer  to  a  tag  list.   The  available tags are as
                  follows.

            PB_LeftEdge          The X position of the progress bar.
            PB_TopEdge           The Y position of the progress bar.
            PB_Width             The Width of the progress bar.
            PB_Height            The Height of the progress bar.
            PB_Direction         The  Direction  in  which  the progress bar
                                 will grow.  Available options are
                  PBDE_RIGHT     From Left to Right  ( default ).
                  PBDE_LEFT      From Right to Left.
                  PBDE_UP        From Bottom to Top.
                  PBDE_DOWN      From Top to Bottom.
            PB_BarColour         The  pen  number  of  the  bar's foreground
                                 colour.  The default value is 3 (Blue).
            PB_BarBackColour     The  Pen  number  of  the  bar's background
                                 colour.  The default value is 0 (Grey).
            PB_BarSize           The logical size of the progress bar.
            PB_BarValue          The  current Value of the progress bar.  It
                                 is better to use UpdateProgBar()  to change
                                 this  value  if  this  is  the only change.
                                 However,  the  option  has been supplied so
                                 that  the  value can be altered at the same
                                 time  as  other  changes  are made.  If the
                                 value  supplied  is greater than PB_BarSize
                                 the actual value stored will be PB_BarSize.
                                 This   guarantees   that   the  bar  cannot
                                 overflow.
            PB_BorderType        The   type   of  border  drawn  around  the

                  PBBT_PLAIN     Plain Black Box  ( default ).
                  PBBT_RECESSED  Recessed Box.
                  PBBT_RAISED    Raised Box.
                  PBBT_RIDGE     Raised Ridge.
            PB_TextMode          The  mode used for rendering the text.  The
                                 available options are
                  PBTM_NONE      No Text  ( default ).
                  PBTM_PERCENT   Display Value as a percentage, e.g. 50%.
                  PBTM_VALUE     Display Value as "Value/Size", e.g. 67/153.
            PB_TextPosition      The  position  you  want  the  text  to  be
                                 displayed.  The available options are
                  PBTP_BELOW     Text centred below the bar  ( default ).
                  PBTP_ABOVE     Text centred above the bar.
                  PBTP_LEFT      Text to the left of the bar.
                  PBTP_RIGHT     Text to the right of the bar.
                  PBTP_CENTRE    Text centred inside the bar.
            PB_TextColour        The  pen  number  of  the text's foreground
                                 colour.  The default is 1 (Black).
            PB_TextBackColour    The  pen  number  of  the text's background
                                 colour.   The  default  is  0 (Grey).  This
                                 value  is  ignored  if the text  is centred
                                 within   the   bar.    In   this  case  the
                                 background will be the bar itself.
            PB_TextFont          A  pointer to a TextAttr structure defining
                                 the  font to be used for the text.  If this
                                 value  is  NULL  the  window's font will be
                                 used (default).

UpdateProgBar()
---------------

NAME
        UpdateProgBar -- Change  the  current  value  of  a progress bar and
                         redisplay its imagery.  (V1.0)

SYNOPSIS
        UpdateProgBar ( PBar, Value )

        void UpdateProgBar ( PBAR *, UWORD )

FUNCTION
        Updates  the  current  value  of  the progress bar, performs all the
        necessary recalculations and redisplays the progress bar.

INPUTS
        PBar  - A  pointer to the progress bar whose value is to be changed.
                This is the pointer returned by CreateProgBar().
        Value - The new value for the progress bar.

NOTES
        If  the  value  supplied  is  greater  than  the  size  of  the  bar
        (PB_BarSize)  the  actual  value  stored  will  be PB_BarSize.  This
        guarantees that the bar cannot overflow.

        If  the  bar's  value  is  to  be  changed at the same time as other
        properties it is better to use SetProgBarAttrs().

RESULT
        None

ClearProgBar()
--------------

NAME
        ClearProgBar -- Removes a progress bar from the display.  (V1.0)

SYNOPSIS
        ClearProgBar ( PBar )

        void ClearProgBar ( PBAR * )

FUNCTION
        Removes  the  supplied  progress  bar from the display.  It does not
