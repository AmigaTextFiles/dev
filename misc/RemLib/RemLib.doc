RemLib 37.1:

    Just a small utility that will remove single library from memory. Its
command line interface is:

    LIB/A,FORCE/S

    LIB is the library name to remove. This MUST contain the .library, or
.datatype or .gadget etc.

    RemLib checks the open count. If it is 0, then it calls RemLibrary()
on that library. Otherwise it will give an error message. Use the FORCE option
to forcefully Remove() the library in this case. If the FORCE option is used,
it will only forcefully Remove the library if its open count is not 0. In
otherwords, it will always RemLibrary() the library if possible.

    No bugs known. I take no responsibility for any damages resulting
directly or indirectly from using this program.

    C source is available from me - just ask.
