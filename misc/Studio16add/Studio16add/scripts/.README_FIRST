NOTES about the script:

	The scripts in this directory must have the 's' protection bit set.
	You can see if it has by using the 'c:list' comand.

	The bit should be set by default, but I you transfer them or copy
	them use the programs CLONE option if any, or use the c:Protect
	comand to add the bits: "Protect <script> +s". If the protection bit
	's' isn't set you must start the scripts with the comand "execute"
	like this: "execute <script>"

	You will need the Studio 16 tools in the package to be in the global
	path such as for example the Sys:C/ dir. If you rather want them in
	the Studio 16 directory you need to add a path to this directory if
	you haven't already. Do this by using the 'c:Path' comand like this:
	"path Studio16_3:c/ ADD" or "path <your-comand-dir> ADD". This is
	most convinient to do from the 's:user-startup' file. To add it to
	the user-startup file do this:

	echo "path <yourdir> ADD" >>s:user-startup (note the double >> !)

	With the protection bit set you should be able to start the script
	by only typing its name. If you wonder how to use the script type:
	"<script> ?" and you will get a short usage. If you need a better
	explination use "type <script>" or refer to the doc.

	The usual place is to put script is in 'sys:s/'.

If you write your own scripts I would like to receive them for future
distribution in the Studio16add package. If you find errors in the scripts
already implemented please let me know (kenny@bgnett.no).

	Enjoy!
