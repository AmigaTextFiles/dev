Cuelist2GFX  DEMO TOOL
----------------------

Created 06.12.97 by Kenneth "Kenny" Nilsen (kenny@bgnett.no)
Revised 08.12.97


This is just a DEMO tool to show one way to read a cuelist file.
This tool will display all tracks (limited by screenheight), all samples and
all events in a cuelist file. It display only the boxes with fadein and
fadeout, selected or not selected, but no crop-in or crop-out. Neither does
it display loga/expo fadetypes or any colors other than showing if a track is
on or off.

USAGE:

You can start this tool from Workbench or CLI. If you don't define any name
from CLI/SHELL a requester will pop up and ask for a cuelist file. Same
goes for Workbench (requester only).
