THE EXPERIMENT


In the bin/ directory there is a file called 'Experiment'. If you have
an AD1012 card, please start this program (Studio 16 must not be running)
[It will not work on an AD516].

If you hear a short (0.2s) 'dam' voice the program works. If so please take
contact with author (kenny@bgnett.no) immediatly and tell. Please also state
your setup.

This is important for further development on sound through the card
independent on the Studio 16 environment.


	- Thank you!
