@{b}INTRODUCTION@{ub}

        This project started October 1997.

        Since Sunrize walked away from business, probably for lure of
        greener pastures (to steel violently from Jamie Krutz) in March
        1995, there has been very little development for Studio 16, none
        officially. People has cried on their knees for developer
        information (including myself), but our humble requests was never
        heard - we only got bad knees in return.

        So sleeves up! I decided to do something about it and started to
        toture the sample files to have them reveal their secrets. Then the
        Cuelist files with good help from John Blyth (which had already
        started something similar a while back, but was restricted by time),
        track files and ..heck, why not, the mixer envelope files as well.
        There was never need for dissasembling or reverse engineering, in
        fact, if that would have been necessary I think I would have
        dropped the project a long time ago (try to disassemble binaries
        compiled in C..). Besides, I wouldn't feel to good about it. No,
        here we needed pure hard work, sweat and tears (..) isolated from
        the rest of the world.

        So, finally, we could now start to create tools to manipulate files,
        fix them, work around bugs and so on. We could get support from
        other audio software authors and we did. I contacted author of AHI,
        Martin Blom, and within twelve hours he had written a filesaver for
        Studio 16 files on my humble request. Thomas Wenzel, author of
        Play16, was very open to it as well and promised support not only
        in Play16, but in Samplitude as well. I spoke to the Octamed people
        which was open for it too, but now at writing time I can't confirm
        this or that conserning OM. Well, I also took the time to write
        several tools myself, mostly for the samplefile, anyway, you will
        find them in the bin/ directory of this archive.

        With the fileformat described herein you should be able to create
        lots of software for Studio 16. Tips: mixer envelope editor with
        graphical envs - how does that sound ? Path exchanger for cuelist
        files so you can move samples to another place in one go - neet ?
        Cuelist-render to sample ? [...] Well, use your own imagination!

        The project will go on and not stop until we have managed to
        achieve direct sound output/input through the cards from memory
        buffers! That will be the next step and a needed on if we want to
        see program support like AHI etc... (I might take a vacation
        around cristmas time though..)

        And feel free to join in. The more brainpower, the better. To do
        that, join the @{"mailinglist" link "POINTERS" 0}. The mailinglist is for discussions,
        ideas, update and news and more. We have only serious people on
        the list and many are pro's who work with Studio 16 everyday who
        is a great resource of information and help - and we even have a
        couple of famous peopleon the list as well.

        ..Oh, and please, if you do find anything which doesn't make sense
        you MUST @{"contact me" link "CREDITS" 0} so I can fix it! A warning at the end:
        I am a terrible worder (atleast in this non-native language) so
        please bear over with me if you get the urge to kill me or something.

        A last note: this @{"project" link "DISCLAIMER" 0} is a private initative and is unofficial.


                Enjoy!

@node "SAMPLE" "Studio 16 Sample file format"
@next "MIXER"
@prev "DISCLAIMER"


@{b}STUDIO 16 SAMPLE FILES@{ub}


The samplefile format consists of an absolute header followed by 16-bit raw
data in Motorola format (MSB first). The format is built like this:

        [HEADER-ID]
           <SampleInfo>
           <SampleClip list>
           <Region list>
        [DATA]

The format is simple to read. In this section we will go through each part of
the fileformat.


@{b}HEADER@{ub}

The file starts with an ID, longword size. The ID is 'KWK3'. Studio 16 is able
to produce other formats as well, but we will not describe those in this
document. You will be able to find resources on those formats elsewhere.

The KWK3 fileformat is specific to Studio 16. It's also called Studio16_2.0
format. Studio 16 saves a version 1.0 format too, but we will not do any
documentation on that format. You should use KWK3 (Studio16_2.0) files.

After the ID mark you can find a SampleInfo structure which consists of
samplefrequency, volume, pan, filter and SMPTE data.

Frequency - The frequency is stored in a LONG word as integer (contrary AIFF
            which stores its frequency as extended float). You just read it
            directly to get the rate.

Filter    - The filter defaults to 1 or the same as samplerate or samplerate
            / 2. The filter value is for the built-in antialias filter. On
            AD516 the filter acts automatically and ignores this value.

Volume    - The volume is stored in a special format. Volumes reflect
            decibels and is stored like this:

               @{i}(Actual volume in dB + 100) x 32 = volume value for file@{ui}

            This will result in the value stored in the file. To extract a
            volume you just do:

                @{i}File volume value / 32 - 100 = dB@{ui}

            As you can see the volume value has steps at 32. You may use 1/4th
            of this value to achieve 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 steps within one
            decibel. The DSP can read this format directly.

Pan       - Pan values are also stored similar to the volume data. A pan will
            have the value -100 for full left, 0 for center and +100 for full
            right. I recommend not to subtract 100 from the value so that the
            values will be 0 for left, 100 for center and 200 for right as
            there is no 'negative' pans. The documentation will assume you do
            not subtract 100 from the value.

SMPTE     - A Sample file may contain a SMPTE stamp. If this value >0 then the
            sample will be adjusted on the Cuelist editor to suit the stamp.
            The format is simple:

              first (unsigned) byte is hours
              second (unsigned) byte is minuttes
              third (unsigned) byte is seconds and
              fourth (unsigned) byte is number of frames.

            Note that frames is relative to which system you use. If you work
            on a PAL system max number of frames will be 25, while on a NTSC it
            will be 30 (29.95DF).

SMPTEFLOAT  Is for SMPTEPLUS. This means you can have 1/samplerate resolution
            to each frame in the file. The value here is a float representation
            of the x/samplerate. You may initialize this value with null.

The format also has one longword for flags and one which is reserved. I have
been unable to document the flag field since nothing seem to make it change.
This may not be true with multiple card systems. If you notice any changes in
this field pleace let me know.

The reserved field must be initialized with NULL.

The next part of the header describes sample data sizes and how to use them.

After the SampleInfo structure (NOTE: We use only one structure for the whole
header - see @{"include files" alink "includes:libraries/studio16file.i"} for more details - SampleInfo structure is based on
original docs from Sunrize) you will find two fields:

S16S_REALSIZE is the absolute size of the sampledata in 16-bits. To get the
real byte size just multiply this value with two (same applies to all sizes
in the sample, with a tiny difference in the SampleClips - see below).

S16S_EDITSIZE reflects the sum of all SampleClips. This may or may not be equal
to _REALSIZE. All programs handling samples should use this 'virtual' size as
reference. S16S_EDITSIZE may be larger than S16S_REALSIZE.


@{b}SampleClips:@{ub}


A sample clip is built like this:

  S16SC_START - start position in sample data in number of samples
  S16SC_END   - end position in sample data minus one

To calculate the size of a sample clip do this:

        @{i}S16SC_END - S16SC_START + 1@{ui}

Notice the + 1 at the end! We add one to include the last sample. To play a
sample you would do the following:

        1. Get size of the sampleclip (S16SC_END - S16SC_START + 1)
        2. Seek() to S16SC_START + S16S_SIZEOF(sampleheader)
        3. Read (buffered) size
        4. Go to next SampleClip if SIZESUM~=S16S_EDITSIZE

As you can see it is quite easy and nifty. You should sum up all the sizes you
get and compare them to S16S_EDITSIZE cause this will determine the end of the
list. Of course, there are maximum 1024 SampleClips in the header so you may
create a number-of-clip counter instead - what suit you most.

To store a SampleClip you do this:

        1. Init S16SC_START with start position in number of samples (excluding
           sampleheader).
        2. Init S16SC_END with end position - 1 (excl. header)
        3. Sum up and store in S16S_EDITSIZE (remember to add one to S16SC_END
           when summing).


@{b}Regions:@{ub}


Regions are quite handy when you work with large files with many audible parts
in it. A region defines an area in the sample which should contain its own
settings such as frequency, volume, pan, smpte and so on. A region can be
dropped on the Cuelist editor.

A region structure consists of the following:

        <region name>
        <sampleclip>
        <sampleinfo structure>
        <reserved space>

Region name - It can be up to 40 bytes in length, but should be kept =< 24
              bytes for compatibillity with the Studio 16 sample editor
              (including null termination).

Sampleclip  - Describes start and end position of this region. Same rules as
              for SampleClips (SIZE = _END - _START +1) apply here too.

Sampleinfo  - See top of file for info on the SampleInfo

Reserved space is ignored by Studio 16. Initialize with null.

There are room for 32 region definitions. To test if a file contains regions or
if a region list ends, you test the first byte in the name for null. If null
then it is empty or ended.

After Regions you will find the sampledata. The sampledata is always 16-bit
stored in Motorola format (MSB first):

        @{i}One sample = [hibyte][lobyte] = signed word = 16-bit@{ui}

This is the same format as with f.ex. AIFF files. To convert to wav files you
will need to swap hibyte and lobyte. To convert CDDA files to Studio 16 samples
you will also need to swap hibyte and lobyte as this is stored in Intel format
like wav files. However, most CD reading software on the Amiga do this for you.
Check the documentation of the software.

For more information on Studio 16 samples, refer to the @{"include" alink "includes:libraries/Studio16file.i/main" 0}
files and example sources.

@node "MIXER" "Studio 16 Mixer envelope file format"
@next "CUELIST"
@prev "SAMPLE"


@{b}MIXER@{ub}

The mixer envelope file is a standard IFF file. It contains data for the
Studio 16 mixer module on volume and pan settings during a Cuelist. The format
is quite simple to read and understand.

The format consists of these chunks:

        [HEADER - IFF FORM [SIZE] "SRMX"]
           <VOL >
           <PAN >
           <CHAN>

The three last chunks are repeated for each channel.

The volume and pan chunks size is always dividable by 8. This is because the
first long word is the position and the second longword (both unsigned) is
the value calculate as in the @{"Sample file format" link "SAMPLE" 0}.

A whole position in seconds is calculated like this:

        @{i}Seconds * 256 @{ui}

If the seconds is '0' then use the range 0-255. You should use a resolution
of 1/256th of a second.


@{b}CHAN CHUNK@{ub}


The channel chunk consists of a 16 byte long preference structure:

(NOTE: I didn't have time to complete the format so the description below
       may not be accurate!)

Card ID    - This describes what card using this channel. It will count from 0.
Channel ID - This is the real-channel ID mark. The input channel is null while
             the output channel is 13 relative to each card installed.
Unknown    - <unknown at this time - init with -1>
MIDI Prefs - This is the preferences for MIDI setup. Here you will find what
             channel and controll ID to use for volume and pan controlling.
             The MIDI channels can be any number within a MIDI channel limit
             (0-15).
Group      - Describes which faders are grouped together and what way.
Unknown    - <unknown at this time - Seem to be a reserved field>

@prev "MIXER"


@{b}CUELIST FILE FORMAT@{ub}

The cuelist fileformat is rather complex compared to Studio 16 @{"sample files" link "SAMPLE" 0}.
They contain both absolute structures and variable structures so you will need
to 'parse' the file everytime (in the sence that you need to obtain sizes on
data in the beginning of the file to read something later in the file).

The Cuelist file is divided into several parts. It's roughly based on IFF
files, but due to how it stores its strings (-> variable chunk sizes within a
chunk and no alignment) it cannot be defined as a standard IFF file even though
it interleave its chunks.

The Cuelist file is built like this (example):

        [HEADER]
          <ID - Window size>
          <Paths and names - vari size>
          <MAIN HEADER - Prefs - flagpositions - etc>
        [TRACKS]
          <TYPE CHUNK - vari size>
            <SAMP or EVNT CHUNK - vari size>
            <...>
          <END! MARK>
          <TYPE CHUNK>
            <SAMP or EVNT CHUNK>
            <...>
          <END! MARK>
          <..etc..>
          <TYPE CHUNK>
            <SAMP or EVNT CHUNK>
            <...>
          <END! MARK>
          <END! MARK>

There are four different chunks, one of the chunks can be two types and
there is an end marker.

(NOTE: Before we move on you should bear in mind that all times in the
Cuelist are calculated in seconds internally. Therefor there is no need to
store if the Cuelist runs on a PAL or NTSC system since the Cuelist editor
itself will recalculate the seconds into the format selected and relative
to system type (PAL/NTSC)).


The chunks are:

TLC1 - Is the header chunk containing window positions, preferences, flagmark
       postions and more (the difference between Cuelist files and track files
       is that track files doesn't have this header).

TYPE - Track header, can be Audio or AREXX type which differ in size

SAMP - If Audio type, then the track consists of this chunk. It defines sample
       positions, sizes and misc attributes.

EVNT - If AREXX type, then the track consists of this chunk. It defines when to
       start an arexx script and what port to use and comands to start.

END! - Ends a TYPE track and the file (double end mark). The end mark only
       consists of a longword sized field with these letters.


@{b}TLC HEADER CHUNK@{ub}

You will have to read 20 bytes of the beginning. These bytes consists of:

ID              - ID of file (ID_TLC) is 'TLC1'
Window left pos - The cuelist editor postions when saved. These values
Window top pos    become the alternative values for the Cuelist window when
Window height     the cuelist file is reloaded. To use them press the
Window width      zip gadget in the window titleborder

The next section contains 4 strings which defines paths and names to Cuelist
file and trackfiles:

[ULONG][TRACKPATH]      - first longword contains the size of the following
[ULONG][TCUELISTPATH]     string. Note that these sizes may be NULL.
[ULONG][TRACKNAME]
[ULONG][CUELISTNAME]

You will need to parse the strings since they can vari in length. After you
have parsed them you will get to the beginning of the main header data (parse
here: read the length and seek/read forward the same length).

The main header consists of two parts:

        [PREFERENCES]
        [FLAGMARKERS]

In the preference section you will find data about almost every specter on the
Cuelist file. However you should be aware of that some settings you use in the
Cuelist editor is not saved to the Cuelist file. The setting not saved are:

        PREFS:Display options
        PREFS:Undo levels
        Menu:Options/Keep original time
        Menu:Options/Use Mixer levels
        Menu:Options/Ignore SMPTE errors
        Movers:Any Direction
        Movers:Lock-To-Grid
        Movers:Vertical Only
        EditMode:Unlimited Crossfade
        EditMode:Limited Crossfade
        EditMode:Butt Edit

@{b}PREFERENCES@{ub}

Fade-In type    - This field describes the global crossfade preferences. When
                  you don't specify a local cross fade for a sample this
                  setting will be used. There are four cross fade options:
                        - Butt (no crossfade)
                        - Linear
                        - Logaritmic
                        - Exponential

Fade-Out type   - Same as above just for crossfade-out.

Maximum time    - You can set a default maximum time for fades. In the
                  preference window you will see this as microseconds, but it
                  is stored as a double floating point value in seconds.
                  If you have 1000ms in window it is stored as 1.0s, if you use
                  740ms it is stored as 0.740s as an example.

                  To convert double float numbers to integer see the source
                  example '@{i}Float2Int.asm@{ui}' or the @{i}mathieeedoubbas.library@{ui}'s
                  autodoc.

Gridspacing     - This is the value the grid lines uses. It is a double float
                  value and describes number of seconds to use between each
                  gridline. Since you have a float number the value can be less
                  than one second.

Start time      - Start time is where the Cuelist will start counting from.
                  Note that this is not the Start flag, but the number refer to
                  the cuelist itself. The value is stored in a doublefloat.

Total length    - This value describes the total length of the cuelist. It is
                  stored like this:  @{i}seconds*100@{ui}. This means that the end of
                  the cuelist will be rounded to 1/100th of a second relative
                  to the start time. Note that the cuelist may contain sample
                  or event pointers past this value. This is an integer value.

ViewSize        - This is for visual preference only. This value describes the
                  size of the cuelist you can see on your screen. It has no
                  influence on start pointer etc. other than graphical reference
                  such as zoom values.

ViewStart       - This is for visual preference only. This value describes the
                  start of the cuelist in the view - that is, start of what you
                  see on your screen. It has no influence on start pointer etc.
                  other than graphical reference such as zoom values.

BPM             - An integer value of @{i}Beats Per minuttes@{ui}. This value is stored
                  even if it's not used.

BPM signature   - These two fields describe the beat and bar settings
                  (signature). A signature could be 4/4 or 3/4 as an example.
                  Each of these values is stored seperatly.

Time options    - Tells the cuelist editor what timer mode to use (note that
                  all internal times are handled as seconds with float
                  decimal). It can be one of these:

                        - Hours Minuttes Seconds

                          The cuelist will use clock numbers as timer

                        - SMPTE

                          SMPTE is usually used to sync video. This format
                          contains SMPTE only.

                        - BPM

                          Here you get the BPM and number of bars (eg. music is
                          often built with 16+16 bars in choruslines).

                        - SMPTE Plus

                          SMPTE Plus is the same as SMPTE, but in addition you
                          have a frame resolution of 1/100th of a frame.

                  A convinient way of convert between these different timer
                  formats is to provide routines to calculate the timeformats
                  to seconds, and seconds to one of the timers.


@{b}FLAGMARKERS@{ub}

After the preference section you will find positions to all the flags. There
are 14 flags in total: 10 jumpmarkers, one start flag, one locate flag and two
punch (in/out) flags.

The section contains:

        [F-KEY MARKERS x10]
        [LOCATE MARKER]
        [START MARKER]
        [PUNCH IN]
        [PUNCH OUT]

Each marker has this structure:

Startposition    - This value is a double float value and describes what
                   position the flag is at in seconds. If the flag isn't used
                   you will find it initialized with -1.

View position    - This longword integer contains -1 if the flag is not in the
                   view in the Cuelist editor and a value in seconds * 100 if
                   you can see the mark in the editor. You may ignore this
                   value (init with null) since this field is ignored by the
                   cuelist editor itself (it recalcs graphical position at load
                   time - internal graphical use only).

Comment          - This field contain an optional comment which can be up to 80
                   bytes in length including a null termination. Note that this
                   field has an absolute size contrary to the other strings in
                   the format.

Reserved         - This field is reserved for ASCII representation. Only the
                   locate mark uses this feature (I guess Sunrize never got the
                   time to update the format to include the other markers). The
                   ASCII text reflects the time-option used as well. All marks,
                   except the locator mark, should have this field initialized
                   with null.

At the end of the header you will find 100 bytes reserved space. You should
skip this data.


@{b}TYPE CHUNK@{ub}


After the header starts each track definitions. The track starts with a TYPE
chunk which can be either for samples or arexx events.

After the TYPE name you will find a string which contains the name of the type
used - the string is stored as [ULONG][TYPE NAME]. The ULONG value will always
be five since Sunrize didn't implement other types than these two (AFAIK):

Audio - This string tell that this track is meant for samples only. Following
        this type name is the Track name in the same format (all chunks use
        the same format for string).

        After this name you will find a structure consisting:

        RATE  - This is frequency of the track. It is stored as a double float
                value.
        PREFS - Here you will find preferences for entries that is unselected
                and selected, track mode (@{i}solo/sound/track on/off@{ui}) and a
                'global' for this track which tells if there are selected
                entries on this track or not.

        Next is the name on the play channel (also a string) and then the
        record channel. These are the "@{i}Any@{ui}", "@{i}Input@{ui}" etc. Note that they
        may have prefixes in the file describing which card they use, f.ex:
        One card system: "AD516.Play 1", multicard system: "AD516_#1.Input R".

        After these two string there are 100 bytes reserved space. You should
        skip these bytes to get to the next chunk.

AREXX - This string tells that this track is meant for arexx only. As with
        Audio type the next string describes the name of the track. The AREXX
        TYPE chunk has another string following the name containing the name of
        the arexx port to use. The AREXX type contains Track preferences
        (@{i}"audio"/solo/track on/off@{ui} etc.). See @{"include" alink "includes:libraries/Studio16file.i/main" 0} files for more info. The
        arexx type chunk also contains 100 reserved bytes you must skip to get
        to the next chunk.


@{b}SAMP CHUNK@{ub}

The SAMP chunk is only allowed in a "Audio" track TYPE. The chunk consists of
the following data:

[SAMPLEHEAD]

Status    - This shows if the entry is selected or not and if it exists on disk
            or not. The latter is mostly for internal use for the Cuelist ED.
Start pos - A double float value describes start position in cuelist in
            seconds. This is relative to the cuelist start value.
End pos   - At which postition the sample ends. Also a double float value.
GroupID   - If this is ~0 then the value describes which group of samples this
            sample belongs to. Each group shares the same value and the number
            can be anything in a UBYTE range (even though it uses a longword in
            these docs).

[SAMPLEPATH/NAME]

Next is the sample path and name on the sample in this chunk. Then you will get
misc data about this entry:

[SAMPBODY]

Fade-In type    - This is the crossfade to use for this sample. See the Header
                  structure for more information.
Fade-Out type   - see the Header structure for more information.
Fade-In time    - this double float value describes the time a fade-in will use
                  in number of seconds. The value may be less than one second.
Fade-Out time   - this double float value describes the time a fade-out will
                  use in number of seconds.
Crop In         - This value is start of the sample in number of samples
                  relative to the Start position of the entry.
Crop Out        - This is length of sample in number of samples. A sample is
                  @{i}Size=CropOut - CropIn Start=StartPos+CropIn@{ui}.
Volume          - This is the volume to use for this entry. See the @{"Sample file" link "SAMPLE" 0}
                  format doc on how the volume is stored.
Pan             - This is the pan to use for this entry. See the @{"Sample file" link "SAMPLE" 0}
                  format doc on how the volume is stored.

The reserved data must be skipped to get to the next chunk.


@{b}EVNT CHUNK@{ub}


The EVNT chunk consists of the following data:

[EVENTHEAD]

The head keeps these datas:

Status    - Status of entry if it is selected or not.
Start pos - Start position to trigger this event. The value is a double float
            in number of seconds.
End pos   - Init this field with the same value as Start pos.
GroupID   - Same as with the SAMP chunk.

[NAME]

Next is the ulong+string holding the name of this entry. The name is just for
the entry and has nothing to do with the scripts or comands.

[EVENTBODY]

The body only consists of a SMPTE stamp. The stamp is a recalculated version of
the start position. The highest resolution here is number of frames.

[COMMANDS x9]

After the SMPTE stamp you will find 9x ulong+strings which describes the
comands to start when the event is triggered. The string length may contain
null.

[EVENTFOOTER]

After the comands you will find 50 bytes reserved space that must be skipped
to get to the next chunk.


@{b}END MARK@{ub}


If the track is ended you will find an end mark instead of a chunk. The
end mark is a long word containing ASCII "END!". You must skip this longword
to get to the next chunk. If there is a new end mark right after then it means
that you are at the end of the file.


-- @{i}End note@{ui}:

You should be aware of that there are some fields we have not managed to
deschiffer at this time. We will do our best to deschiffer these unknown fields
and to document the behaviour of the fields we know what is, but not how they
are calculalted (zoom values) although they are ignored by the Cuelist editor.
We also believe that some fields are kept for backward compatibility.

What this document describes should be enough to convert Cuelist files to
other formats (such as ASCII, CMX and other EDLs) and to alter the different
settings. You should also be able to convert other formats to Cuelist format
as well.

If you have information, suggestions and comments conserning this document and
the way it is written please take @{"contact" link "CREDITS"}.

@{b}TRACK FILE FORMAT@{ub}

This page will be very brief. The reason for that is that a track (TRAX) file
is the same as a cuelist file except it doesn't contain any header. A track
file may contain one or more tracks of different types (Audio/AREXX). A track
file is built like this:

        [HEADER]
          <ID = TRAX>
        [TRACKS]
          <TYPE CHUNK - vari size>
            <SAMP or EVNT CHUNK - vari size>
            <...>
          <END! MARK>
          <TYPE CHUNK>
            <SAMP or EVNT CHUNK>
            <...>
          <END! MARK>
          <..etc..>
          <TYPE CHUNK>
            <SAMP or EVNT CHUNK>
            <...>
          <END! MARK>
          <END! MARK>

The Cuelist copybuffer is also a TRAX file.

Please refer to the @{"Cuelist file format" link "CUELIST" 0} description for more details on the chunks.

                  stereo, 8- or 16-bit format. 8-bit files will be
                  converted to 16-bit files. Stereo files will be
                  splitted and extended with _L and _R. Mono files will be
                  extended with _MONO

        DestStudio = Destination path and filename base without any
                     extensions.


 CDDA2Studio    - Splits a CDDA in two Studio 16 files to path
 -----------

        USAGE: <CDDA> <destpath/file> [-i]

        CDDA            = A CDDA image in Motorola or Intel format.
                          CDDA -> 16-bit 2 channel raw file.
        Destpath/file   = path and filename to put the Studio files
        -i              = Use this option if CDDA is in Intel format.


 Cuelist2GFX    - Graphical representation of a Cuelist
 -----------

        USAGE: <Cuelist>

        From Workbench: double click and select a cuelist file
        from the requester (if no file is given to the file from cli
        it will pop up a requester as well).

        Use '?' for program info.

        NOTE: Program is made for DEMO usage only!


 DumpCue        - Dumps the content of a cuelist file or trackfile
 -------

        USAGE: <Cuelist file | Track file>

        Cuelistfile     = A Studio 16 cuelist file
        Trackfile       = Or a track file

        NOTE: Program is made for DEMO usage only!


 JoinAIFF       - joins two mono AIFF files to one stereo AIFF
 --------

        USAGE: <MonoAIFF> <MonoAIFF> <DestStereoAIFF>

        MonoAIFF        = A mono AIFF file. One of two which will be
                          joined into one stereo AIFF file. Both 8- and
                          16-bit files are supported.
                          Note that the size, frequency and bit resolution
                          must be the same.
        DestStereoAIFF  = The result of the joined mono AIFF files.


 KStudioCheck   - Check which card(s) you have installed if any
 ------------

	USAGE: <>

        Will report if you have a AD516, AD1012 or both cards installed
        or none.

        Now count number of each card types and reports if any card is
        in use.


 RAW2STUDIO16   - convert raw 8/16bit intel/motorola file to S16
 ------------

        USAGE: <RAWfile> <Studiobase> -8 -i

        RAWfile = Must be a stereo RAW file in 8- or 16-bit, Intel
                  or Motorola format.
        Studiobase = The name of the Studio 16 files.
        -8      = use this option if the RAW stereo file is in
                  8-bit format.
        -i      = use this option if the RAW is in Intel format.


 S16DownSample  - Half a sample in size (frequency is adjusted)
 -------------

        USAGE: <Studio infile> <Studio outfile>

        Studio infile   = The Studio 16 file you want to half in size.
        Studio outfile  = The new file which will be half in size and have
                          the frequency halved as well (so playback will be
                          the same as with the original).

        Note that there is no checking frequencies. This program is
        designed to halve 44.1 khz files, but can be used with other
        frequencies as well.


 S16Fileinfo    - show some vital info about a S16 file
 -----------

        USAGE: <Studio file> [-l] [-r]

        Studio file     = Studio file to dump info on. Dumps different
                          settings of the file such as frequency, SMPTE,
                          volume, PAN, filter, sizes etc.

        -l = List SampleClips
        -r = List Regions (if any)


 S16FixFile     - Try to fix a corrupt Studio 16 file
 ----------

        USAGE: <Studio file> [options]

        Studio file     = Studio file to fix

        -c = clear region definitions

                Force clearing of Region definitions. If you know there is
                an error and this program doesn't recognice it. Also useful
                for general clearing of Regions.

        -e = remove SampleClip list

                Force a clearing of all edits (Undo All). The sizes will be
                corrected.

        -f = force file recognition

                This option forces FixFile to ignore filerecognition. This
                can be useful where Studio 16 file header is corrupted. Note
                that non Studio 16 files may (most likely will) be
                corrupted.

        -i = force filter set to 1

		Set filter to 1 no matter what the original filter is set
		to.

        -p = force pan set in center

                Set pan to center (100) no matter what original pan is set
                to.

        -q = quiet

                Don't output any log.

        -r = force frequency rate set to 44.1 khz

                Force frequency of file to 44.1 kHz no mater what the
                original frequency is set to.

        -t = test only, no updating

                When this option is used the program will not update
                anything on the file, only show what's wrong and not.

        -v = force volume to +0 dB

                Force volume to +0 dB no matter what the original volume is
                set to.

        This program will try to correct a corrupted Studio 16 file. It will
        correct filesizes, samplesizes, different settings, checksum
        sampleclip tables and region tables. If you have a corrupted file
        where you have lost a part of f.ex. the end, this program will most
        likely succeed in correcting it. Main purpose is to allow the Studio
        16 editor to load the file for additional edits after the file has
        been corrected. You don't need any extra space for correcting the
        file. Note that with some filesystems it may not be possible to
        correct the filesize if of odd size. Works with official AI
        filesystems and third party AFS filesystem is tested and work ok.
        The program cannot correct bitmap errors on your disk! Use proper
        software for correcting such errors.

        TIP: You can use this program as an "UndoAll" program as well. Use
        it like this "S16FixFile <file> -e -t" and remove the '-t' when you
        have seen that the file doesn't contain any other errors.


 S16InitFilter  - Init Studio 16 files with filter set to 1
 -------------

        USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio file     = Studio 16 file to init filter to.

        This program was originally made due to a bug the beta version of
        S16MakePermanent had which set frequecncy value in filter as well.
        To fix this is an easy way I made this little tool. There should not
        be any use of this tool per today, but I added it to the package
        anyway. Perhaps if you want to modify existing files with a different
        filter setting, then it could be useful. Oh well..


 S16IsPermanent - check if a Studio file contains edits
 --------------

        USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio file     = Check this file if it contains SampleClips or
                          not. Useful from scripts.


 S16ListRegions - list all regions defined in a Studio file
 --------------

        USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio file     = File to get list of regions on. The program will
                          return WARN if no regions was defined.


 S16MakePermanent - converts all edits to a permanent file
 ----------------

        USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio file     = will convert this file's SampleClips to permanent
                          edits (like the "Make permanent" menu item in the
                          Studio 16 sampleeditor). The program do as Studio
                          16: convert to <file>.edit, deletes the original
                          after completion and renames <file>.edit to
                          <file>. It also deletes the .graph file if any.

        The program will skip files that are already permanented and return
        WARN.


 S16ReadFreq    - dumps frequency of a S16 file
 -----------

	USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio File     = file to read the frequency from. Useful in
                          scripts.


 S16ReadPan     - dumps pan setting of a S16 file
 ----------

        USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio File     = file to read the PAN setting from. Useful in
                          scripts.


 S16ReadSMPTE   - dumps SMPTE position of a S16 file
 ------------

        USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio File     = file to read the SMPTE position from. Useful in
                          scripts.


 S16ReadVolume  - dumps volume setting of a S16 file
 -------------

        USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio File     = file to read the volume from. Useful in scripts.


 S16Regions2Files - convert Regions to seperate files
 ----------------

        USAGE: <Studio file> <destdir/>

        Studio file     = Studio 16 file containing Region definitions.
                          The regions of this file will be extracted and
                          saved as seperate files using the region names.
                          Any spaces in the name are converted to
                          underscores.
        DestDir/        = Path only to where you want to save the files


        NOTE: This program doesn't consider actual SampleClips in the
        sample. If you experience faulty results then try to make your
        sample permanent (S16MakePermanent or editor menu).


 S16SetFreq     - modifies the frequency of a S16 file
 ----------

        USAGE: <Studio file> <frequence>

        Studio file     = file to alter
        Frequence       = new frequency to set in the file


 S16SetPan      - modifies the pan setting of a S16 file
 ---------

        USAGE: <Studio file> <pan>

        Studio file     = file to alter
        PAN             = new PAN setting to set in the file


 S16SetSMPTE    - modifies the SMPTE position of a S16 file
 -----------

        USAGE: <Studio file> <SMPTE>

        Studio file     = file to alter
        SMPTE           = new SMPTE to set in the file. Set the SMPTE like
                          this: HH:MM:SS:FF (H=Hours, M=Minutes, S=Seconds,
                          F=Frames).

        Example:
                S16SetSMPTE TestFile_MONO 00:01:12:22


 S16SetVolume   - modifies the volume setting of a S16 file
 ------------

        USAGE: <Studio file> <Volume>

        Studio file     = file to alter
        Volume          = new volume to set in the file


 S16StampRegions - copy SMPTE from file and put in Regions
 ---------------

        USAGE: <Studio file>

        Studio file     = the file containing SMPTE stamp and regions.

        Note that the SMPTE must be greater than >00:00:00:00


 S16Time        - Calculates the time in hours/min/sec of a sample
 -------

        USAGE: <Studio 16 sample>

        This tool will dump the time this sample will use to finish playing.
        The tool consider the edited size, not the real size as the edited
        size is the one the editor and the rest of Studio 16 will use.


 S16UpSample    - doubles a sample in size (with interpolating)
 -----------

        USAGE: <Studio infile> <Studio outfile> [-i]

        Studio infile   = The Studio 16 file you want to double in size.
        Studio outfile  = The new file which will be double in size and
                          have the frequency doubled as well (so playback
			  will be the same as with the original).
        -i              = use this option to use interpolating when
                          upsampling. Interpolating will cause much better
                          quality on the new sample!

        Note that there is no checking of frequencies. This program is
        designed to double 22 khz files, but can be used with other
        frequencies as well (at own risk!).


 SplitAIFF      - splits a stereo AIFF into two mono AIFF files
 ---------

        USAGE: <StereoAIFF> <monoAIFF base>

        StereoAIFF      = Stereo AIFF in 8- or 16-bit format to split.
        monoAIFF base   = name of the two new mono AIFF files that will be
                          created. Each file get extended with .L and .R


 SplitCDDA      - splits Stereo RAW file (eg. CDDA) to S16 files
 ---------

        USAGE: <RAW Stereofile (CDDA)>

        RAWfile = Must be a stereo RAW file in 16-bit format.
                  This program is specially designed to convert
                  CDDA files created with MakeCD.

        The Studio 16 files will be put in same dir extended with _L and
        _R.

        NOTE: SplitCDDA is replaced by CDDA2Studio. SplitCDDA kept for
        script compatibility.


 SplitCDDAI     - same as above, but CDDA is in Intel format
 ----------

	USAGE: <RAW Stereofile (CDDA) in Intel format)>

	NOTE: SplitCDDAI is replaced by CDDA2Studio. SplitCDDA kept for
	script compatibility.


 Studio2AIFF    - convert a Studio 16 file to AIFF format
 -----------

        USAGE: <Studio file> <AIFF>

        Studio file     = Studio 16 file to convert
        AIFF            = Name on mono AIFF file to be created

        This program converts a single Studio 16 file into a mono 16-bit
        AIFF file. It now supports Studio 16 files which contains edits.
        The AIFF file will be a result of the edits in the Studio file.

@{b}1. Basic Information@{ub}

1.1 - About the Hardware

        Taken from a Sunrize Industries promotional brochure:

        AD516
          Features stereo in, stereo out connectors plus a SMPTE-in jack.
          Supports 16 bit, CD quality at rates of up to 48,000 samples
          per second and 8 track playback from hard disc.

        AD1012
          With mono in, mono out, one-channel audio mono digitization and
          and 12 bit resolution, the AD1012 is capable of sampling rates
          of up to 48,000 samples per second.  It includes four channels
          of 12 bit audio playback and reads SMPTE code.

        DD524*
          The DD524 Digital Audio I/O Board adds AES/EBU and an S/PDIF
          digital audio input/output to your Amiga computer enabling you
          to transfer data directly to and from Digital Audio Tape.
          Supported by Studio 16 editing software, as well as hard disc
          backup software, the DD524 supports 16 or 24 bit samples,
          44.1KHz or 48KHz sampling rates and stereo.

        * To the best of the author's knowledge, this card was never
          released - this information is included for historical
          interest only.

1.2 - About the Software

        Taken from a Sunrize Industries promotional brochure:

        Studio 16's modular controls easily integrate with each other
        and outside software packages....Cue List lets you coordinate and
        synchronize hundreds of sounds to either internal or external
        SMPTE time code by using your mouse to activate any editing
        function....Using Mixer, you can adjust the volume and pan of
        each channel in real time as you would with a "real" mixer....Built
        in SMPTE Time Code Monitor displays time code on your screen, and
        can be genlocked to make a window dub....Studio 16's meters
        display sound levels for each track on traditional VU and bar
        graph meters with peak hold....Waveform Editor lets you edit
        multiple waveforms simultaneously and cut and paste one digital
        sound into another.

1.3 - About the Manufacturer

        Sunrize Industries was the company that made the AD516/AD1012
        cards and its software, Studio 16.  Sunrize Industries no longer
        exist as they closed for business in March 1995.


@{b}2. Hardware/Software Support@{ub}

2.1 - Is there any external software support for AD516/AD1012/Studio16?

        Yes, including the following:

        Audio Thunder (Asimware, $89 USD)
        Supports conversion and sequencing of Studio16_2 format files into
        a number of formats, including CDDA, Flyer Audio, AIFF, etc.

        Bars and Pipes Professional (Blue Ribbon, $FREE)
        Allows Studio 16 to run on the B&P screen with the SunSet
        accessory, and syncing via internal SMPTE with the SunMPTE
        accessory.  Studio16 versions earlier than 3.0 use the SunOut and
        SunTrack tools, which will crash under Studio16 v3.0+.  These
        tools should have been included with your copy of Studio16.

        Sample Wrench (dissidents, $299 USD!)
        An excellent sound editor and processor, and the current version
        (3.1) allows Studio 16 to be used for playback.  Sample length
        is limited to available ram, however.

        AudioLab (Maurizio Ciccione, $125 USD)
        A sound processor, file format converter, sequencer (includes a
        variation on Studio16's cuelist), filter designer, and lots more.
        Does not allow for playback through the AD516/AD1012.

        Scala MM400
        Scala has an EX driver for the cards which allow you sync upto two
        samples (stereo) and play them through the AD516/AD1012.

        SoundFX (Shareware, $25 USD)
        An excellent array of effects and processing tools.  Will load
        files in the Studio16_2 format.  Does not allow for playback
        through the AD516/AD1012, and sample length is limited to
        available ram.

2.2 - Can I use the AD516 with Newtek's Video Toaster?

        If you have the Toaster Handler software from Sunrize, you will
        be able to use 1-2 tracks of audio on the AD516 with Studio16,
        even while the amiga is locked doing the Toaster's transitions.
        Without the Toaster Handler, this is not possible.

2.3 - Can I use Studio16 with DPS Inc.'s Personal Animation Recorder?

        Yes.  The PAR will sync to Studio16's internal SMPTE timecode
        easily and reliably, with no added software.

2.4 - Is there an AHI driver for the AD516/AD1012?

        Not at this time. There are at least two teams working on achieving
        this.  One of the teams involves former Sunrize Industries employee
        Ben Fuller. The second team (us) is working from Sunrize docs and
        specs only.

2.5 - Can Studio 16 import/export CMX files?

        No. The Cuelist can export an ASCII list, but does not support CMX
        directly. We are working on getting this support.

2.6 - Where can I get details on Studio 16's fileformat ?

        You can get it from Pauli Porkka's Amiga soundcard page
        <http://www.iki.fi/~pporkka/> and from Aminet at
        <ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/Studio16add.lha>


@{b}3 - Miscellaneous Questions@{ub}

3.1 - What is the latest version of Studio 16 ?

        The latest version is 3.01A. The difference between 3.01 and 3.01A
        is the AD516-handler file.  On the author's system, the newer
        handler seemed to clear up minor startup problems when using
        multiple AD516 cards.

3.2 - Does the AD516/AD1012 read and output SMPTE timecode?

        The AD516 and the AD1012 both read external SMPTE timecode,
        provided it is LTC format.  Users of VITC need to use and external
        LTC converter.  Studio 16 also outputs an 'internal' timecode,
        which can control and interface with things such as Bars and Pipes
        Professional and the DPS Personal Animation Recorder.  Neither the
        AD516 nor the AD1012 can 'stripe' tape, or output an external
        SMPTE signal.  An extra program available from Sunrize, called
        SMPTEOut, allows the Amiga's built-in audio to output SMPTE
        code, in LTC format, and this can be used to control external
        devices, or 'stripe tape'.

3.3 - Does Studio 16 support the use of graphics cards?
     
	Yes, although there are a few problems.

>From sag@cae.ca Sun Nov 30 15:42:22 1997:

I've been using Studio16 & B&P together on a Picasso II/CyberGraphx 1600x1300
virtual screen  (running under an 800x600 resolution mode-I think) for a few
years now . The Studio16 s/w runs (surprisingly!) very well on a Picasso II
screen (A2000). Can't say I've ever had any graphic-specific problems with
it. The problems I've encountered are usually with B&P. Ex: The notes show
up as lines.

On Thu, 27 Nov 1997, Bob Maple wrote:

I have a Spectrum board running CyberGraphX and Studio16 is so-so on it.
Sometimes playback will 'hiccup' when the cuelist scrolls, the editor is
nearly un-usable because it's so slow to drag the mouse around, and if I flip
screens while playing back, the output hiccups.

>From fdiebel@boulez.emrl.com Sun Nov 30 15:43:03 1997:

i use the studio16 through a retinaII with the retinaemu software in
1024x768 mode, and it works great.  the only problem i've noticed is some
random characters appearing in the top of the cuelist.  other than that,
perfect - screen switching and everything.  of course, this card isn't
nearly as supported as most others, i.e., it doesn't run with cybergrafx
or picasso96 software.

3.4 - Can I use an external mixer with Studio 16?

        Yes.  Sunrize recommended the JL Cooper Fadermaster specifically,
        but any MIDI capable mixer should work.        

3.5 - Are there any known problems or limitations with Studio 16?

        There are a few, and the will affect some users more than others.
          - Limited hardware input channels.  Each AD516 comes with only
            two inputs (the AD1012 is mono, with one input).  This problem
            can be solved by installing more cards - up to four AD516
            cards can be installed in one machine, giving the user eight
            inputs.
          - No effects loop capability with Studio 16's mixer module. If
            you have more than one AD516 installed in your machine, you
            can sort of 'kludge' an 'effects loop' together, but it is not
            ideal.
          - Mixing tracks on the fly with only a mouse can be frustrating,
            as well as time consuming.  This problem can be solved
            somewhat with an external hardware MIDI mixer.  See item 3.5.

3.6 - Why can't I save some of the mixer settings?

        The mixer module or Studio 16 has a bug which simply 'forgets' to
        save the settings.  This may have been a "safety" feature
        implemented by Sunrize, in the same way the Cuelist's ON/OFF
        button always defaults to OFF upon starting up.
        In any event, a patch will be made so that user's can choose.


@{b}A - Appendix and Extra Information@{ub}

A.1  - What is a 'DSP' ?

        DSP stands for Digital Signal Processor. It is a little chip that is
        capable of handling different kinds of signals in realtime. A DSP can
        be programmed to do certain operation on signals. The ADSP2105 in
        the Sunrize audio cards is designed to operate on audio signals.

A.2  - Is there a mailing list for Studio 16 ?

        Yes, there is. To join the list you simply send

        mailto:majordomo@thule.no

        with a body message that only contains this line:

        subscribe studio16

        After you get confirmed your subscription you enter or reply to
        the address studio16@thule.no

        The mailinglist is hosted by the people that made Thor (offline news
        and email reader, ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/comm/thor/).

A.3  - Where can I find updated software ?

        You will find it on Aminet. It will be announced on the mailing
        list and in comp.sys.amiga.announce.  You will find the main
        add-on archive which contains all updated tools on Aminet in
        ftp://ftp.wustl.edu/pub/aminet/dev/misc/Studio16add.lha and on
        Pauli Porkka's Amiga Audio Card page http://www.iki.fi/~pporkka/

A.4  - Is there a support page for Studio 16 ?

        Not at this time other than the one mentioned in A.3.

A.5  - Where can I contact Sunrize Industries ?

        You can't. Sunrize do not longer exists and the former employees 
        are hard to get hold of - and if you do they don't reply on Studio
        16 questions..
