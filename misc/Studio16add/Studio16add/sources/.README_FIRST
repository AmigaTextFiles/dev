The sources in this directory (in any language) is PUBLIC DOMAIN on the
condition that the original copyright is added in your modified source.
You do not need to add the original copyright if you write your source
from ground.

The main purpose is to demostrate how to handle/create Studio 16 files.

HOW TO GET THEM TO WORK:
------------------------

	You will need the official Commodore include files from the
	v40 distribution (kickstart/OS 3.1).

	Put these in a directory called "includes" and assign "inc:" to this
	dir with the 'c:assign' comand like this "assign Inc: <yourplace>".
	You also need LVO (Library Vector Offset) files in inc:lvo/. They
	should be named <library>_lib.i.

	Always use latest version of PhxAss (freeware from Aminet:dev/misc/) to
	assemble the sources. I have added an arexx script for CygnusED to
	assemble the sources. You may need to modify the arexx script such as
	path.

	The NewStartup (startup.asm) should be put in "inc:" as well as the
	'digital.macs' file (latter only containing a few macros).

If you like to have your own sources (in any language) distributed with this
package, please send a request to me at kenny@bgnett.no.


	Enjoy!
