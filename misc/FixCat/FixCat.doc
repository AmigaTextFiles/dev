Before anything else

The author will therefore take no resposibility for the proper or improper
use of this program. Use it however you like. It's freeware.


Introduction

Some catalog files seem to cause crashes when loaded into a catalog editor
called CatEdit. This is due to different approaches used for determining
the actual length of the traslated strings. I haven't seen the specs for
the IFF catalog files format so I can't say whether the bug is in the
CatEdit or in the tool used to create such catalogs, but anyway, here
is the cure. This quickly written (just a shell interface) program will
fix the catalog so that it can be used in CatEdit, too. Source included.


Usage

Really simple this one. Just write the name of the catalog to be fixed right
after the name of FixCat. The catalog will be fixed in place, so you might
want to take a backup of it first. FixCat, however, should be smart enough
to notice if there are any extraordinarinesses in the file and refuse going
on. After processing the catalog FixCat shows the number of strings corrected
if any (it doesn't matter whether the file is ok already).


Source

Written in SAS/C V6.56. What else to know?


Future

As I don't have much need for this kind of program (so far I've encountered
two "badly" coded catalog files) there will probably be no updates.
