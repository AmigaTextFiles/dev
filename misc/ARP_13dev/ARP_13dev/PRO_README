This file contains programmer documentation for use of V1.3 of
"arp.library" (library version 39.1).  ARP, the AmigaDOS Resource
Project, is a group effort to provide enhancements to AmigaDOS for
users, as well providing a resource for Amiga developers and Commodore
to help improve the Amiga's OS software.

This file, ARPPRO3.ZOO is freely redistributable *PROVIDED IT IS
DISTRIBUTED IN IT's ORIGINAL UNMODIFIED FORM*.  Please do not make
any changes to any files which you pass on to others; the user's
only insurance that they have the officially supported version of the
ARP release is in getting the files exactly as released.  For further
information about distribution and support of ARP,  please read the
file "DISCLAIMER", which is included with this distribution.

This ZOO file is organized into several directories, which can be
de-archived with the ZOO "//x" option to build the complete directory
structure of the original files.

In this ZOO file are:

(1) This file, "PRO_README", plus the files "DISCLAIMER", "ARPLICENSE",
	and "Programmers_Manual".

	Developers and publishers who would like to include files from
	the ARP release with their distributions should return a signed
	copy of the file "ArpLicense" to the address noted in the file.

(2) Functional documentation for each arp.library function.  The
	functions which are new or changed in V1.3 of ARP (V39.1 of
	arp.library) are in the subdirectory "NEW_MANUAL", with the
	older documentation in subdirectory "OLD_MANUAL".

(3) The INCLUDE subdirectory, which has the C-language "arpbase.h"
	and the assembly "arpbase.i" include files.  Also in the
	INCLUDE directory is "arp_lib.fd" for BASIC programmers.

(4) Vendor support subdirectories for MANX and LATTICE which has files
	needed to support the vendor-specific needs.  Conspicuously
	absent here is the M2SPRINT vendor support files, which are not
	included in ARPPRO3.ZOO because M2S includes them as an
	officially supported part of their release diskettes.

	NOTE that the vendor support files are supplied "as-is" and
	have not been extensively tested.  Please request support from
	your particular language vendor if you need more than we are
	able to provide in these vendor support files.
