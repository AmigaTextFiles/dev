Disclaimer for ARP

We have put every effort into making the ARP programs work as documented
and perform at least as well as their BCPL counterparts.  However, we are
sure there will be some bugs which may cause some ARP users problems due
to incompatabilities or simply due to program and documentation errors.
We will make every effort to solve such problems in future releases, but
make no warranty as to the fitness for use of any of the programs or
documentation included in the ARP release.

If you would like to print copies of the ARP documentation, you may
print up to 50 copies without explicit permission; please contact
ARP Support if you want to print more than 50 copies.

If you find any problems with ARP programs, we will appreciate if you will
report them to the address below.  Please do not phone Microsmiths for
ARP bug reports.
