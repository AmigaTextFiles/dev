This is a license agreement which permits an Amiga software developer
or publisher to include files from the ARP distribution with their
Amiga software releases.

ARP is Copyright (c) 1987,88,89 by ARP Authors, which is represented
for this license agreement by Microsmiths, Inc.  The ARP distribution
includes executable files, an Amiga "library", and documentation for
users and programmers of the various components.

ARP Authors have granted permission for these files to be freely
redistributed in their original unmodified form so that the files can
be available as BBS distributions as well as on diskettes.  The current
versions of these files are "ARPREL3.ZOO", "ARPDOC3.ZOO",
"ARPPRO3.ZOO", and "ARPLIB3.ZOO", as of September '89.  The restriction
that the archived "ZOO" files must not be modified in any way is to
help to insure the integrity of the ARP release, both to insure the
files are accurate and complete and to assist in describing exactly
what users should look for to find any particular part of the ARP
release.

By returning this signed contract, Amiga software vendors are granted
permission to include de-archived versions of the files with their
diskette releases of software.  Most frequently this will be to include
the file "arp.library", which may be necessary for the vendor's program
to run.

No license is required unless actual materials from the ARP release are
included, or substantial trade based on the ARP name is made. 
Developers do not need permission for use of "arp.library" unless
arp.library is included with a software distribution.

The vendor may also choose to include the executable programs from the
ARP release, or the user documentation.  This contract grants
permission to distribute any of the files from the four "ZOO" files
described above on diskette releases as discreet files, provided the
following conditions are met:

************************************************************************

(1) None of the files may be modified in any way; the files should be
copied to the master diskette as de-archived from the original ZOO
files, or as otherwise provided directly by ARP Authors. To insure
integrity, the original ZOO files should be obtained from one of the
sources which ARP Authors have directly supplied with the files; these
are the telecommunications services BIX, CompuServe, and PeopleLink.

(2) No more than 50 copies of any documentation provided by ARP Authors
may be printed, as noted elsewhere in the ARP distributions.  Please
contact ARP Authors for permission to print more than 50 copies of any
part of the ARP documentation.  ARP Authors and Microsmiths, Inc.
retain commercial rights for any products which are substantially
related to "ARP"; this license grants permission to use ARP materials
within products which do not substantially relate to ARP.  Please
contact ARP Support regarding if you have any question about what this
license covers; we will be glad to discuss commercial rights for
products which are directly related to ARP but grant no rights in this
license agreement.

Commercial vendors of "public domain" software should contact ARP
Support about sales of "ARP" diskettes.  Permission is granted to
non-commercial vendors of "public domain" software, such as users
groups, to include the official ARP release materials on diskette
provided that the materials included are either the original unmodified
ZOO files, or the complete unmodified contents of one or more of the
ZOO files, which are clearly separated on the diskette from other
materials not provided as part of the ARP materials.  We request that
such vendors return this license so that ARP Support can contact the
vendors regarding new releases of any of the ARP materials.

(3) This license is only for distribution on diskette; if files are to
be transmitted via modem, they must be provided in their original ZOO
format.  The file "ARPLIB3.ZOO" is recommended for vendors who wish to
include "arp.library" with a BBS distribution of software, as it is
much smaller than the full "ARPREL3.ZOO" file.  Our recommendation is
to document that arp.library is needed, and where to find it, rather
than actually including any of the ZOO files with BBS distributions,

If a developer/publisher determines it is necessary to include
"arp.library" directly in their ARCHIVED files, permission is granted
to include the unmodified "ARPLIB3.ZOO" file within the archives, if
the following conditions are met:

  - This license agreement is signed and returned
  - The author includes a copying restriction clause similar to the
    clause in the ARP ZOO files, allowing copying of the files only only
    in the original, unmodified archived format.
  - The author includes the line "The ARPLIB3.ZOO file in this archive
    is included with permission from Arp Authors, and may not be copied
    except in it's original unmodified file."
  - The author provides a list of all places where the author will post
    any archives which include ARPLIB3.ZOO.

(4) This license agreement makes no legal committment binding to either
Microsmiths, Inc.  or ARP Support.  The licensee assumes all risk
regarding fitness of use of any of the ARP materials, or any other
liability issues.  The sole legal committment in this agreement is
permission from ARP Authors to include the materials described above
for which ARP Authors claim copyright.
