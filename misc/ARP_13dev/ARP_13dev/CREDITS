Thanks to the following people for assistance with the ARP programmers
documentation.  Apologies for anyone I have not mentioned.

	Scott Ballantyne, who wrote all of the V1.1 documentation and
	C bindings.

	Bill Barton and Mike Sinz, who wrote the V1.3 versions of the
	MANX and Lattice support materials.

	Charlie Heath, who finally put everything together for V1.3.

	Willy Langeveld and Dan Barrans, for their critiques.

	Martin Taillefer, for extensive proofreading as well as for
	including ARP programmers support in the M2SPrint Modula 2
	package as an official vendor supported part of the release.
