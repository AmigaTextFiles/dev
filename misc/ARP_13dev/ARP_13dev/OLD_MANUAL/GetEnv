     NAME
	  GetEnv -- Get	the value of an	environment variable

     SYNOPSIS
	  strptr = Getenv("string", buffer, size)
	    d0		    A0	      A1     d0

     FUNCTION
	  This function	provides an environment	variable mechanism
	  compatible with MANX.	 Note that this	call is	more efficient
	  than using the manx getenv() function	call when arplibrary
	  is installed.

     INPUTS
	  string -- pointer to an environment variable name.

	  buffer -- a user allocated area which	will be	used to	store
		  the value associated with the	environment variable.
		  This may be NULL.

	  size -- size of buffer region	in bytes.

     RESULT
	  If found, a pointer to the string for that variable will be
	  returned.  NULL means not found.

	  NOTE - in V39.0 of ARP, it is no longer recommended to use
	  a NULL buffer to get internal access to the MANX/Rokicki
	  environment.  Please see GetEnv_ADDENDUM for details.

     ADDTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
	  arp.libraries	environment variable mechanism is compatible
	  with the MANX	software, which	has set	the defacto standard
	  implementation for the Amiga.	 This call is NOT equivalent
	  to the Manx getenv() call, however.

     BUGS
	  None Known.
