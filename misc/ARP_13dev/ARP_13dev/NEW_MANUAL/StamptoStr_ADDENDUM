     ADDENDUM FOR
          StamptoStr - Convert DOS datestamp into text date string.

     USAGE NOTES
          The StamptoStr() function has not changed from the V1.1
          release, however there are two limitations in the
	  implementation which programmers may want to compensate for
	  when using StamptoStr().

	  First, StamptoStr() does not check an input datestamp for all
	  invalid values, which can result in either unusual strings
	  being returned, or in a long calculation delay.  This will
	  only happen if an invalid DOS datestamp is passed but there
	  are several sources of invalid date stamps (bad applications
	  and system software), so it may be desirable to make the
          following range checks of the input datestamp:

              ds_Days should be limited to about 36500 (about 100
	      years), larger (unsigned) values are out of range.

              ds_Minutes should be limited to 1440 (60*24).

              ds_Tick should be limited to 3000 (50*60).

	  Second, the dat_StrTime string is not automatically NULL
          terminated for you when StamptoStr() is called.  Thus, if
          your program passes in an uninitialized dat_StrTime buffer
          and expects it to be returned NULL TERMINATED, you may get
          unexpected garbage at the end of the string. This can be
          resolved by initializing the entire dat_StrTime string to
          NULL, or in particular, you can just set the 8'th character
          to NULL which is the position at the end of the HH:MM:SS
          string.
