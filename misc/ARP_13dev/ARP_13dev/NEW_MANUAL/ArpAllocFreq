     NAME
	ArpAllocFreq - Create an initialized FileRequester structure.

     SYNOPSIS
	  FileRequester = ArpAllocFreq( )
		d0

     FUNCTION
	  This function allocates a "FileRequester" data structure
	  which has been initialized to include optimized default
	  values for the FileRequest() function.
	  
	  For compatability with future versions of arp.library,
	  it is recommended to use the ArpAllocFreq() function rather
	  than creating your own FileRequester data structures.

    INPUTS
	   None.

     RESULT
	  FileRequester - Pointer to a struct FileRequester as used
		  in the ARP FileRequest() function.
		  
		  The fr_Dir and fr_File fields will contain string
		  pointers to allocated buffers.  DO NOT ALTER these
		  values.  It is safe to use the TackOn function to
		  concatenate the fr_File field into the fr_Dir field,
		  and then use BaseName to separate the filename from
		  the path substring.  The buffers will allow at least
		  FCHARS bytes in each string.  Do not assume more.

		  DO NOT alter any fr_FuncFlags values except by ORing
		  in new flag values.  ArpAllocFreq will initialized
		  flag values which must not be altered to assure
		  upwardly compatible operation.

	  TRACKER - pointer to the resource tracking node.  This value
	  	  is only returned on a sucessful open.  The value is
	  	  returned in register A1 for assembly, or via the
	  	  defined function "LASTTRACKER" in C.

     REMEMBER
	  You must call	FreeTrackedItem(TRACKER), ArpExit() or
	  CloseLibrary(ArpLib) to free this resource.

     BUGS
	  None known.
