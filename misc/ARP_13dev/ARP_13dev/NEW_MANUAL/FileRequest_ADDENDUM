     ADDENDUM FOR
	  FileRequest -- Get filename from user

     ADDITIONS IN V1.3
          The main change in the FileRequest() function for V1.3 of
          ARP is the addition of of the ArpAllocFreq() call as the
          preferred method to allocate and initialize the input data
          structure.  Use of the ArpAllocFreq() call insures upward
          compatability for future ARP releases.  If you do NOT use
          ArpAllocFreq(), do not expect your calls to FileRequest to
          work under V1.4 of AmigaDOS and beyond.  See "ArpAllocFreq"
          for usage notes.

          The "fr_reserved2" longword field, which had been initialized
          to ZERO under V1.1 of ARP, is now used to specify the Left
	  and TOP edge offsets desired.  If initialized to ZERO, the
	  file request will be displayed at the default position, but
	  if the application puts LeftEdge and TopEdge values into
	  the fr_LeftEdge and fr_TopEdge fields, the request will be
	  brought up at the requested position, offset by one pixel so
	  that (1,0) will actually position the request at (0,0).

	  See "ArpBase.h" for a description of the FileRequester data
	  structure.  Note that the desired field is still defined as
	  "LONG fr_reserved2" in "arpbase.i", left as an exercise
	  for the assembly language programmer.

          In V1.3, the invalid return values for fr_Function() calls
          has been fixed so developers can use the FRF_DoWildFunc
          function call.

          Note that use of the fr_Function() calls to alter the window
          using the NewWindFunc and AddGadFunc callbacks is not
          guaranteed to work under V1.4 of AmigaDOS.
