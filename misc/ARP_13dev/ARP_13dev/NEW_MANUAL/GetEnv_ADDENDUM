     ADDENDUM FOR
	  GetEnv -- Get	the value of an	environment variable

     FUNCTION
	  In V39.0 of arp.library, the GetEnv function call has been
	  enhanced such that it will read BOTH the MANX/Rokicki
	  format environment variables, as well as the new ENV:
	  environment variables which have been adopted by Commodore.
	  This will allow you to merge the two formats of environment
	  variables, so that applications which use the ARP GetEnv()
	  will be assured of working under both environments.

	  The current implementation of SetEnv() is still using the
	  MANX/Rokici format environment variables, which are faster
	  and more efficient than the current ENV: implementations
	  for temporary environment variables.  In a future
	  implementation, as more programs make the transition to the
	  new ENV: format and when a real ENV: handler is released by
	  Commodore, the ARP environment variable functions will be
	  changed internally to use ENV: exclusively.  Applications
	  programs which use ARP GetEnv() and SetEnv() will
	  automatically continue to work with any new implementation,
	  since the calling procedures will remain the same as the
	  current specifications.
	  
	  NOTE one change in the specification for GetEnv()'s calling
	  procedure is that it is NO LONGER RECOMMENDED to use the
	  zero-length buffer within a FORBID() context to get direct
	  access to the MANX/Rokicki environment variable.  If you
	  use this technique, your program will NOT be able to find
	  environment variables which use ENV:, and since that is
	  anticipated to be the only implementation in the next ARP
	  release, it will mean that your application would no longer
	  be able to find it's environment variables.
