     NAME
	SPrintf - print formatted data to string.

     SYNOPSIS
	  count = SPrintf(buffer, "String", *args)
	    d0		    d0	     A0	      A1

     FUNCTION
	  This function	performs 'standard' C-style formatting of data
	  to the string buffer "buffer".  It uses the exec function
	  RawDoFmt() to	do the actual formatting of the	data.  The %
	  types	supported by this function are quite standard, see any
	  C reference for details.

     INPUTS
	  buffer - A string buffer in which to store the formatted
		  string.  This buffer must be large enough to hold
		  the formatted string; there is no error checking
		  done for buffer overflow.

	  "String" - pointer to	a C-style format string.

	  *args	- Pointer to start of argument stream.

     RESULT
	  count	- if all goes well, the	total count of characters
		  copied to buffer will be returned.  If an error
		  occured, this	function will return -1.

     ADDITIONAL	CONSIDERATIONS
	  You must be aware of the values actually passed to this
	  function by your compiler, especially	since some compilers
	  promote all values to	32 bit integers	in function calls.

     BUGS
	  None known.  Beware of overwriting end of buffer.
