     ADDENDUM FOR
	  ASyncRun -- Create an	asynchronous process.

     FUNCTION
	  In V39.0 of ArpLib, the ASyncRun() function has been revised
	  so that it will work with BCPL programs.  Also there are
	  some new calling modes which will allow ASyncRun() to create
	  a NewCLI.  See "ArpBase.h/i" for details on the new input
	  values which may be used with ASyncRun() to assist in using
	  ASyncRun() in various modes.
