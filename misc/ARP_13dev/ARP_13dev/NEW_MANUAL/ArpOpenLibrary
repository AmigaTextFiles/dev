     NAME
	ArpOpenLibrary - Open a library and track it.

     SYNOPSIS
	  library = ArpOpenLibrary( libname, version )
	    d0			      A1	D0

     FUNCTION
	  This function is equivalent to the AmigaDOS OpenLibrary(),
	  except that this function will remember that the library
	  is open and close it for you using ARP resource tracking.

    INPUTS
	  libname - library name, exactly as with "OpenLibrary".

	  version - Version number, exactly as with "OpenLibrary".

     RESULT
	  library - a library pointer or 0, exactly as with
		    "OpenLibrary".

	  TRACKER - pointer to the resource tracking node.  This value
	  	    is only returned on a sucessful open.  The value is
	  	    returned in register A1 for assembly, or via the
	  	    defined function "LASTTRACKER" in C.

     REMEMBER
	  You must call	FreeTrackedItem(TRACKER), ArpExit() or
	  CloseLibrary(ArpLib) to free this resource.

	  Do NOT call CloseLibrary( library ) to close the library
	  opened by ArpOpenLibrary!.

     BUGS
	  None known.
