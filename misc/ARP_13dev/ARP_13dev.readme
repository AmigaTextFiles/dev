The AmigaDOS Resource Project (ARP) was a project created by a group of
Amiga developers who also wished to offer enhancements to the early
AmigaDOS, as well as offer to C programmers a set of equal or more powerful
DOS programming features that could only be accessed from the normal
dos.library by using the BCPL language.

arp.library still serves a useful purpose, it provides most of AmigaDOS 2.0
functionality under 1.3 (rather, 2.0 implements ARP functionality) -
therefore, programs can support both OSes, with the aid of arp.library. One
example of this is the XFD package.

arp.library can be used from any language that supports standard Amiga
libraries, but only C and ASM support are included directly.
