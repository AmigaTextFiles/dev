@{b}@{u}INTRODUCTION TO EasyRCS@{ub}@{uu}


Revision Control System (RCS) is definitely a very usefull program for anyone
who deals with many different revisions of the same files (e.g. programmers).
But... it is a CLI only program! This doesn't fit well in the graphical
environnement of the Amiga. So comes the need of an interface to use RCS from
the Workbench.

So I made EasyRCS, RCS made EASY! The program is very simple but still is very
powerful. All important functions of HGWRCS are supported:

    * Basic Check In / Check Out functions with or without lock.

    * Comment for each revision (modifiable afterwards).

    * Symbolic revision names.

    * Default revision or branch (see RCS docs).

    * Browser for the revision comments.

    * ...
@endnode

@node "Requirements" " Requirements            "
EasyRCS requires:

    * HWGRCS, the Amiga Port of RCS

    * textfield.gadget (included)

    * easyrexx.library (included; needed to use the ARexx capabilities)

    * An Amiga (!) with Workbench 2.1+

@node "Installation" " Installing EasyRCS      "
@{b}@{u}INSTALLATION@{ub}@{uu}


An Installer (© Viscorp) script is provided that does the job  for  you.  But
you  will  have  to decide where to put the program and other files. As it is
only a small tool, no drawer will be created and you will have  to  choose  a
good location depending of your system.
@endnode

@node "Starting" " Starting EasyRCS        "
@{b}STARTING EasyRCS@{ub}


To use EasyRCS you must place a PROJECT ICON  for  EasyRCS  in  your  working
directory. How to do?

1) You have SASC:
    if  you  have  installed  the  project  icon   the   "SC:starter_project"
    directory, all you have to do is to launch the "scsetup" program (see SAS
    documentation for details).

2) You don't have SASC:
    Make a copy of the project icon, or simply drag it in the directory if it
    is  in  a  different  volume  (it will only be moved if it is on the same
    disk!).


Make sure the "RCS" directory exists, or that "RCS_link" points  to  a  valid
directory.

And then, click on the project icon!!!

Or with a shell, CD to your work directory and  type  EasyRCS  [RETURN].  The
Programme will launch and detach itself from the shell. The tooltypes will be
read anyway.
@endnode

@node "ToolTypes" " Tooltypes Configuration "
@{b}@{u}TOOLTYPES@{ub}@{uu}


EasyRCS recognise several ToolTypes:

 @{b}WINTOP
 WINLEFT
 WINWIDTH
 WINHEIGHT@{ub}

    These are the size and position of the main window. If you don't want  to
    use them EasyRCS will have the default size. But if the tooltypes are not
    present, you won't be able to use the @{"Snapshot" link "Menus" 0} Menu.


 @{b}VIEW@{ub}

    You can set this tooltype to three different value: OUT, IN,  BOTH.  With
    this  you  can choose want you want to see in the main window: files that
    are checked in RCS, files that are out or all files. Default in BOTH.


 @{b}EXT@{ub}

    RCS uses an extension for its files. Usually  it  is  ",v"  but  you  can
    change  it.  It  is usefull to read files that where created on platforms
    that do not support the coma as a valid character in a filename. You  can
    specify  several  extension seperated by a slash "/". Default is ",v/" to
    support ",v" and no extension.


 @{b}EDITOR@{ub}

    You must tell EasyRCS the @{u}full path@{uu} of  the  editor  you  want  to use to
    edit your files. Default is "ED".


 @{b}PUBSCREEN@{ub}

    In case you want to open EasyRCS on a public screen,  use  this  tooltype
    with the name of the screen.


 @{b}PATTERN@{ub}

    This tooltype is very important as it will allow you to see in  the  main
    window  only  the  files  you're interested in. The pattern is a matching
    pattern not an exclude pattern. Defaults to "#?.(c|h)".

    If you prefer an exlude pattern use "~( exlude pattern )".


 @{b}AREXX<n>@{ub}

    The AREXX<n> tooltypes are used to add entries in the  ARexx  menu.  You
    can  specify  several tooltypes of this kind as long as you increase the
    <n>. The valid names for the tooltypes are AREXX1, AREXX2, ...

    The syntax is AREXX<n>=Menu Name,ARexx script name
@endnode

@{b}@{u}USING EasyRCS@{ub}@{uu}


Once EasyRCS is started, you are presented with the main window. This  window
contains  a list of all files and two buttons: one to check the selected file
in and the other one to check it out.

In the list the files are displayed in two different ways: either  the  plain
file name if it is not checked in RCS or in brackets { } if it is checked in.
The check in and out operations are accessible with  the  buttons  while  the
other are available as @{"menus" link "Menus" 0}.
@endnode

@node "Menus" " The Menus               "
@{b}@{u}THE MENUS@{ub}@{uu}


MAIN WINDOW MENUS

@{b}EasyRCS@{ub}

    @{b}About@{ub}
        Displays informations about EasyRCS.

    @{b}Re-read@{ub}
        Scan the RCS directory again to add new  files  in  the  main  window
        list.

    @{b}Snapshot@{ub}
        Fixes the window position. The @{"Tooltypes" link "ToolTypes" 0}  of  the  project  icon  are
        modified if they are present, nothing happens if they are not!

    @{b}Quit@{ub}
        Quits the program!


@{b}Files@{ub}

    @{b}Check IN file@{ub}
        Checks the selected file in RCS. The check IN window will  be  opened
        so  you can enter a revision comment, an optional revision number and
        state (default is Exp). Same as the  Check  IN  gadget  of  the  @{"main" link "Using" 0}
        window.

    @{b}Check OUT file@{ub}
        Checks the selected file out of the RCS directory so you can edit it.
        The  Check  out window will open for you to enter optional parameters
        for the operation (revision number, date or state). Same as the Check
        OUT button in the @{"main" link "Using" 0} window.

    @{b}Lock file@{ub}
        Gains lock on the selected file. Should be seldom used! Only  if  you
        modified  a  text  that  was  still  present  in your editor, but was
        checked in inbetween. In that case the file has no more lock  and  is
        shown  as  checked  in.  The Lock file menu will make it a valid file
        again.

    @{b}Cancel Check Out@{ub}
        Cancel the last Check Out operation on the selected file: all changes
        will be lost! Beware!!

    @{b}Default Rev/Branch@{ub}
        Sets the default branch or revision to use for the selected file  for
        the  subsequent  Check OUT operations. Note that the default revision
        in not used if you specify a revision number during the check out.

    @{b}Edit Symbols@{ub}
        Opens the Symbol Manager  window  for  the  selected  file.  In  this
        window, you can add or remove symbolic names for the revisions.

    @{b}Show Change Log@{ub}
        Opens the show change log window. All comments  for  every  revisions
        are  displayed.  The  window  has  a  @{"menu" link "Menus" 77}  to edit the comments, add
        symbols...


@{b}View@{ub}

    @{b}Checked OUT@{ub}
        The main window list will show only the files that  are  out  of  RCS
        (Checked Out or never Checked In).

    @{b}Checked OUT@{ub}
        The main window list will show only the files  that  are  Checked  in
        RCS.

    @{b}BOTH@{ub}
        The main window list will show all files.


@{b}ARexx@{ub}

    @{b}Execute Script...@{ub}
        Opens a requester to choose an ARexx script to lanch.

    @{b}Next Entries@{ub}
        Additional entries in  this  menu  are  user  configurable  from  the
        @{"tooltypes" link "ToolTypes" 0}.  They  are  direct access to ARexx script. Just select the
        script you want to execute it.



SHOW CHANGE LOG WINDOW

    @{b}Edit@{ub}
        Opens another window to edit the comment of the selected revision.

    @{b}Add Symbol@{ub}
        Adds a symbolic name to the selected revision.

    @{b}Delete Revision@{ub}
        Deletes the selected revision. The is no way you can get it back
        later, so think twice before doing it!

    @{b}Delete Range@{ub}
        Deletes a range of revisions. Very dangerous! You should think about
        what you are doing for a while before pressing the OK button!

@node "ARexxScripts" "ARexx Scripts"
@{b}@{u}AREXX SCRIPTS@{ub}@{uu}


A few ARexx scripts are provided with EasyRCS. You can write your own macros
to add some functions to EasyRCS.

If you write some ARexx scripts, please send them to me for inclusion is the
next release. Your macros could also be useful to other people.

All ARexx scripts for EasyRCS should have the ".ercs" extension.



@{b}CleanFiles.ercs@{ub}

This will remove all unchanged files from the OUT list. A "cancel check out"
function will be performed on the files that were not modified since they were
last checked out.


@{b}GlobalSymbol.ercs@{ub}

This script will add a symbolic revision name to all of the files. If the last
revision in the RCS archive file is not up to date then the "check in" window
will open for you to enter a comment.


@{b}RemoveGlobalSymbol.ercs@{ub}

Removes a symbolic revision name from all the files where it is present.


@{b}ScanFiles.ercs@{ub}

This is from the HWGRCS manual:

     @{i}The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions
     of files.  RCS  automates the storing, retrieval, logging,
     identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is useful for text
     that is revised frequently, for example programs, documentation,
     graphics, papers, and form letters.@{ui}  



RCS is ported to the amiga by Heinz Wrobel, under the name HWGRCS.
