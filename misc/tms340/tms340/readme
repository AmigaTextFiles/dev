Here are some files for my new tms340class
******************************
This is just a quick preview !
******************************
I'm currently working on the A2410.class
and what also has to be done is to include
a Subclass for 8 and 16 bit modes of the 
DirectorII Gfx Board. (This board doesn't
run at the moment, my A3000 power supply 
has an overload ??)
This demo gives you an short overview how
I would imagine an future RTGClass.library(TM)
and I want to release it before we get an 
CyberTrash(TM) into the next OS. Though this
library is _NOT_ ment to be an RTG library
it shows what direction to go if you implement
some "Line/Rect" etc. Methods. If you are 
interessted, contact me at an address (sig. below)
Also if you want to write some classes for other
boards. (eg. TMS340 like Resolver/Vivid, other ?)
If I can spread this around the world, it would make
sence to use it as a base for an EGS driver 
(for now) and maybe for RTG sometimes later
(RTG by AT, of course). I will sure 
rewrite my EGSA2410Driver to support this
new library/class (I have to make a cleanup anyway).
