    NAME
        CreateTex - Creates a Texture Handle

    SYNOPSIS
        struct TexHandle *CreateTex(RtgScreen,Tags)
                D0                   A0        A1

        struct TexHandle *CreateTex(struct RtgScreen *,struct TagItem *)

    FUNCTION
        This function creates a texture handle. The provided tags list, which
        features of the 3D Engine are to be used.

        tex_TexMap:     Address of the Texture-Map, which should be uploaded to the
                        Graphics Memory. Note: This is not the Address of the Texturemap
                        HANDLE, it is the address of the Texture itself !!!

        tex_MapSize:    The Size of this Map

        tex_ColorFmt:   The Color Format of the Texture-Map

        tex_FilterType: The Filtering Type, that should be used for Texture Filtering

        tex_TexWrap:    Boolean Flag, if Texture-Wrapping should be used

        tex_LitTex:     Boolean Flag, if Lit-Texturing should be used

        tex_AlphaBlend: The Alpha-Blending config

        Take note, that uploading a texture to GFX Memory should only be done
        at times where speed is not important. Also take note, that there
        will be a "Screenmode-System" for Color-Formats and Filter-Types to
        support Multiple Chipsets in a later version of this library. Also
        take note, that this call is still to be expanded, and that you also
        should check your Chipset3D structure if a certain operation is
        available.

        The Alpha Blending Values are :

        ABlend_Source  = -1
        ABlend_None    =  0
        ABlend_Texture =  1

        The Blending Values are :

        Blend_Com      =  0
        Blend_Mod      =  1
        Blend_Decal    =  2

        The Color Formats are :

        CF_ARGB32         =  0
        CF_ARGB16         =  1 (RGB4444 !!!)
        CF_ARGB15         =  2 (RGB1555 !!!)
        CF_ALP4BLE4       =  3
        CF_BLEND4LO       =  4
        CF_BLEND4HI       =  5
        CF_LUT8           =  6 (Palletized Data)
        CF_YUYV16         =  7 (YUV Data)

        These constants CHANGED, as the names used before (ARGB32...) were
        already used by the smr_ChunkySupport tag. As the 3D Lib was not
        yet released, this namechange is not a problem, though.

        The Filter Types are :

        TPPM1          =  0 (MIP-Mapping, not yet supported)
        TPPM2          =  1 (Linear MIP-Mapping, not yet supported)
        TPPM4          =  2 (Bi-linear MIP-Mapping, not yet supported)
        TPPM8          =  3 (Tri-linear MIP-Mapping, not yet supported)
        TPP1           =  4 (Point Sampling)
        TPPV2          =  5 (For YUV Data)
        TPP4           =  6 (Bi-Linear Mapping)

        Also always have a look at the Chipset3D Flags:

        0 Fogging and Alpha Blending cannot happen at the same time on this chip
        1 Alpha Blending Objects can cause problems with Z-Buffering on this chip
        2 Wrap-Around is not supported for p-correct textures on this chip
        3 In Palettized Mode, this Chip only supports Decal Blending
        4 Gouraud Shading does not work in Palettized Mode (Reasonable :) )
        5 Lit-Texturing does not work in Palettized Mode (Reasonable :) )

        The Chipset3D structure looks like the following, more info in 3DExt.guide:

        struct Chipset3D
        {
         struct Library *Base3D; // This is the LibBase of rtg3DExt !!!
         int mapping;
         int p_mapping;
         int filters;
         int tmapclr;
         int fog;
         int blend;
         int ablend;
         int zbuf;
         int mux;
         int gouraud;
         int lit;
         int line;
         int wrap;
         int ovl;
         int mem;
         int size;
         int lsize;
         int flags;
        };

        The Chipset3D structure tells you the features of a chip, the max. size
        of the textures, the 3DExt LibBase of the Chip, the Flags and how much
        GFX Memory you have. You get the address of the structure using
        GetRtgScreenData of rtgmaster.library. Z Buffering is enabled using
        OpenRtgScreen of rtgmaster.library (but up to now it does not work).

        The function does not upload the texture. This has to be done manually,
        or using LoadTex.

        If not enough texture memory is available, CreateTex() returns 0.

    INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen to use
        Tags      - The Tags to use

    RESULTS
        TexHandle - Pointer to the TexHandle of the created Texture
