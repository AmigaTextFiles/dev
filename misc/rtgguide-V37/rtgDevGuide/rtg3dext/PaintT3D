    NAME
        PaintT3D - Paints textured or shaded triangles to the Screen

    SYNOPSIS
        PaintT3D(RtgScreen,TexHandle,BlendType)
                  A0        A1        D0

        void PaintT3D(struct RtgScreen *,struct TexHandle *,ULONG)

    FUNCTION
        This function renders a triangle, specified as

        typedef struct
        {
         long x,y,z,u,v;
         long color;
        } Point3D;

        typedef struct
        {
         Point3D p1,p2,p3;
         struct TexHandle *th;
        } Triangle3D;

        The Triangle is described by three points with polygon- and
        texture-coordinates. The color is for the use of Gouraud-Shading
        or Lit-Texturing. The Texture-Handle indicates the texture to use.

        The BlendType can be used to light up or to darken the image. Normally
        only 15/16/24 Bit Screens support this fully. You should use Doublebuffering
        to display the textures. Sadly, i did not yet get this function work together
        with Back-Bitmap-Clearing. But well... this is an Alpha Version.

    INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen to use
        TexHandle - The TexHandle to use
        BlendType - The BlendType to use
