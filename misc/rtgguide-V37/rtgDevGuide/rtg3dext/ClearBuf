    NAME
        ClearBuf - Clears a Doublebuffering Buffer

    SYNOPSIS
        void ClearBuf(RtgScreen,BufNum)
                       A0        D0

        void ClearBuf(struct RtgScreen *, ULONG)

    FUNCTION
        This function is used to clear the Back Buffer (it can also clear
        the front buffer, but this does not make sense). This function
        needs at least rtgCV3D.library V2.43 to work correctly.

        Note that a
        rtgCV3D.library screen (and possible screens of other 3D Sublibs also)
        can only do 2 buffers, not 3.

        Also note, that ClearBuf ONLY works if you do NOT promote the Screen !!!
        This CANNOT be fixed, never promote a rtgCV3D.library screen, or you get
        much flickering.

    INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen
        BufNum    - Number of the Buffer to clear
