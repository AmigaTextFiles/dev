   NAME
        CopyRtgPixelArray -- Copy a rectangular array of pixels directly
                             to the graphics card memory without any
                             conversion

   SYNOPSIS
        CopyRtgPixelArray(RtgScreen, BufferAdr, Array, Left, Top, Width, Height,SrcX,SrcY
                           A0         A1         A2     D0    D1   D2     D3     D4   D5

        CopyRtgPixelArray(struct RtgScreen *, APTR, APTR, ULONG, ULONG,
                          ULONG, ULONG,ULONG,ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        Copies a rectangular array of pixels directly to the graphics card
        memory with no conversion.  The array of pixels is assumed to be
        in the correct native format so it can be copied at maximum speed.
        The copy routine however does take segment boundaries in account (if
        required).

        This routine is mainly intended for machines which have relatively
        fast FastRAM compared to the speed of the graphics card RAM.  This
        is usually on machines with a 32-bit accelerator card which have
        a Zorro-II graphics card installed.

        Note: For compatibility with rtgAMI.library,
        Array should contain at least ((((width+15)>>4)<<4)*Height Bytes.

        NOT YET IMPLEMENTED ON ECS/AGA. SrcX and SrcY not yet implemented.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        BufferAdr - The address of the memory containing the actual
                    screen graphics
        Array - Pointer to an array of pixels which is Width pixels wide,
                and Height pixels high.  The size of the pixel is dependant
                on the ScreenBuffer your copying to.  Make sure the array
                is in the correct native format.
        Left - X position of the top-left of the rectangular pixel array
        Top - Y position of the top-left of the rectangular pixel array
        Width - Width of the array in pixels
        Height - Height of the array in pixels
