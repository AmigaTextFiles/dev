   NAME
        WriteRtgPixelRGB - plots a single pixel to a RtgScreen

   SYNOPSIS
        WriteRtgPixelRGB(RtgScreen, BufferAdr, XPos, YPos, Color)
                          A0         A1         D0    D1    D2

        WriteRtgPixelRGB(struct RtgScreen *, APTR, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        Draws a single pixel at the specified position on a RtgScreen.
        The BufferAdr is the starting address of the buffer the users wants
        to draw the pixel in.  The user has obtained this address using
        LockRtgScreen() and GetBufAdr().  The BufferAdr is needed to specify
        the correct buffer for screens which are double or triple buffered.

        This function should only work for True Color modes, Color is
        a 32 bit value which specifies what Color the pixel should be.
        The layout of this 32-bit value is as follows:

        %aaaaaaaa.rrrrrrrr.gggggggg.bbbbbbbb        

        a = AlphaChannel (8-bits) which may or may not be ignored.  The
            user will set this to zero if the user doesn't want to use
            AlphaChannel.
        r = Red component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value
        g = Green component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value
        b = Blue component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value

        THIS FUNCTION IS IMPLEMENTED WITH SUBLIBRARIES STARTING WITH VERSION 1.8

        DO NOT USE FOR SPEED RELEVANT STUFF. THIS FUNCTION MAY HAVE
        SOME OVERHEAD. FOR FAST OPERATIONS USE COPYRTGPIXELARRAY OR
        DO THE STUFF YOURSELVES.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        BufferAdr - The address of the memory containing the actual
                    screen graphics
        XPos - X position of the pixel the user wants to plot
        YPos - Y position of the pixel the user wants to plot
        Color - A 32-bit value describing the color (see above)
