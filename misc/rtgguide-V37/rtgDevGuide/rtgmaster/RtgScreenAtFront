   NAME
        RtgScreenAtFront - determines if a RtgScreen is at front

   SYNOPSIS
        boolean = RtgScreenAtFront(RtgScreen)
                                    A0

        RtgScreenAtFront(struct RtgScreen *)

   FUNCTION
        This function should determine if this RtgScreen is currently at
        front.  It should return TRUE (0xfffffff) if the screen is in front
        of all other screens, and FALSE (0) if the screen is behind (partially
        or completely) an other screen.

        Note that this function will not be heavily reliable, since the user
        might switch screens at any time.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.

   RESULTS
        boolean - TRUE if screen is at front, FALSE otherwise.
