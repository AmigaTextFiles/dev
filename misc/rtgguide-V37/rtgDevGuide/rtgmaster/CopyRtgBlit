   NAME
        CopyRtgBlit -- Copy a rectangular array of pixels without conversion, with
                       Modulo support and c2p support

   SYNOPSIS
        CopyRtgBlit(RtgScreen, BufferAdr, Array, Masked. Left, Top, Width, Height, WidthSrc, HeightSrc, SrcX, SrcY)
                     A0         A1         A2     A3      D0    D1   D2     D3      D4        D5         D6    D7

        CopyRtgBlit(struct RtgScreen *, APTR, APTR, ULONG, ULONG,
                    ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        Nearly the same like CopyRtgPixelArray, but also has Modulo Support. Additionally,
        it provides c2p for ECS/AGA, while CopyRtgPixelArray works in Planar Mode for
        ECS/AGA. CopyRtgBlit does only support synchronous c2p, as signalling would
        slow down the function a bit. It is faster than CallRtgC2P. In case of a
        asynchrone c2p being chosen, it uses a default synchronous c2p algorithm.
        In fact it is adviced to use this function, the old ones are mainly provided
        for backward compatibility. Masked feature not yet implemented for AGA.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen to use
        BufferAdr - The Video RAM Base Address to use
        Array     - The Source Array
        Masked    - If Masked == 1, only pixels != color 0 will be overwritten
        Left      - The Destination X Offset
        Top       - The Destination Y Offset
        Width     - The Width of the Blit
        Height    - The Height of the Blit
        WidthSrc  - The Width of the Source
        HeightSrc - The Height of the Source
        SrcX      - The Source X Offset
        SrcY      - The Source Y Offset
