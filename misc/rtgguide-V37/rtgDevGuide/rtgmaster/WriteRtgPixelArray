   NAME
        WriteRtgPixelArray - writes an array of pixels to a RtgScreen

   SYNOPSIS
        WriteRtgPixelArray(RtgScreen, BufferAdr, Array, Left, Top, Width, Height)
                            A0         A1         A2     D0    D1   D2     D3

        WriteRtgPixelArray(struct RtgScreen *, APTR, APTR, ULONG, ULONG,
                           ULONG, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        Draws an rectangular array of pixels to the specified position on a
        RtgScreen.  The BufferAdr is the starting address of the buffer the
        user wants to draw this array of pixels in.  The user has obtained
        this address using LockRtgScreen() and GetBufAdr().  The BufferAdr is
        needed to specify the correct buffer for screens which are double or
        triple buffered.

        This function should only work for Palette mapped modes.  The array
        consists of one byte per pixel, each byte specifying a Color number.

        This function is many times faster than writing each pixel seperately
        to the screen using WriteRtgPixel().

        Note: For compatibility with rtgAMI.library,
        Array should contain at least ((((width+15)>>4)<<4)*Height Bytes.

        THIS FUNCTION IS IMPLEMENTED WITH SUBLIBRARIES STARTING WITH VERSION 1.8

        DO NOT USE FOR SPEED RELEVANT STUFF. THIS FUNCTION MAY HAVE
        SOME OVERHEAD. FOR FAST OPERATIONS USE COPYRTGPIXELARRAY OR
        DO THE STUFF YOURSELVES.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        BufferAdr - The address of the memory containing the actual
                    screen graphics
        Array - Pointer to an array of pixels which is Width pixels wide, 
                and Height pixels high.  Each pixel is one byte in size.
        Left - X position of the top-left of the rectangular pixel array
        Top - Y position of the top-left of the rectangular pixel array
        Width - Width of the array in pixels
        Height - Height of the array in pixels
