        struct RtgScreen *OpenRtgScreen(struct ScreenReq *, struct TagItem *)


   FUNCTION
        This function should open the screen which falls within the 
        parameters specified by the user.  If this function can't
        deliver such a screen than it will fail and will return zero.

        Note that the Width and Height values you get from
        rtgmaster.library have been checked to see if they are valid
        for this screenmode.  Also note that RtgTags may be zero.

   INPUTS
        RtgTags - Pointer to (an array of) TagItem structures,
                  terminated by the value TAG_END (0).
        ScreenReq - ScreenReq structure as returned by RtgScreenModeReq()
                    of rtgmaster.library, see rtg.i for more information

        Each TagItem is an optional tagged data structure which
        identifies a parameter to OpenRtgScreen().  The applicable tag ID
        values for TagItem.ti_Tag and their corresponding data can be
        found in the .i/.h file where the Tags for OpenRtgScreen() are
        specified.

   RESULTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for the screen you opened.  The user may
                    later use this handle to get information about
                    this screen or perform actions like setting the 
                    palette or double/triple buffering.  You should
                    returns NULL if the screen couldn't be opened.
