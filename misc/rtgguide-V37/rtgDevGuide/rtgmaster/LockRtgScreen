   NAME
        LockRtgScreen -- Locks a RtgScreen (prevents it from being moved
                         in memory)

   SYNOPSIS
        address = LockRtgScreen(RtgScreen)
         D0                      A0

        APTR LockRtgScreen(ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        This function should make sure that the screen is not moved from
        it's current location in memory.  In other words, it will guarantee
        that the address you get back from this function remains valid
        until you call UnlockRtgScreen().
    
        The result from this function should be the address of the buffer
        associated with the screen either in the graphics cards own
        memory or the computers memory.

        For multi-buffered screens the return-address must point to buffer
        0 for this RtgScreen.  To get the addresses of the other
        buffers the user will use GetBufAdr().

        LockRtgScreen and UnlockRtgScreen functions must nest, which means
        you must call an UnlockRtgScreen for every LockRtgScreen.  The
        field rs_Locks in the RtgScreen structure should be used to keep
        track of the number of times a screen was locked.

        Note : On some Graphics Boards this function will take some
        CPU time to happen, so it is advised ONLY to call it *once* at the start
        of your code (And UnlockRtgScreen *once* at the end of your code,
        to be on the sure side...)

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.

   RESULTS
        address - The address of the (first) buffer of this screen.
