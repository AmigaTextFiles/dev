   NAME
        FreeRtgScreenModeReq - frees the ScreenReq structure again

   SYNOPSIS
        FreeRtgScreenModeReq(myreq)
                              A0

        FreeRtgScreenModeReq(struct ScreenReq *)

   FUNCTION
        This function frees the memory allocated by RtgScreenModeReq again.
        Should be called after you need that data not any longer. Note: This
        function caused a system crash with an early Beta Version of rtgmaster.library.
        This does no longer happen, as this bug got fixed. This function is
        only in the master-library, not in the sublibraries.

   INPUTS
        myreq - The ScreenReq Structure returned by RtgScreenModeReq
