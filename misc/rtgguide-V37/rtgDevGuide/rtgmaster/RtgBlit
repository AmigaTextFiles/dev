   NAME
        RtgBlit - Performs a Blit without waiting

   SYNOPSIS
        RtgBlit(RtgScreen,SrcBuf,DstBuf,SrcX,SrcY,DstX,DstY,Width,Height,Minterm)
                 A0        a1     a2     d0   d1   d2   d3   d4    d5     d6

        void RtgBlit(struct RtgScreen *, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG,UBYTE)

   FUNCTION
        This function blits the rectangle at (SrxX,SrcY) in the Buffer with the
        NUMBER SrcBuf (0-2) to the position (DstX,DstY) in the Buffer with the
        NUMBER DstBuf (0-2). The Blit has Width Width and Height Height.

        For most GFX Boards this function is the fastest way to move
        graphics data.

        Note : On some boards (for example EGS Boards) this function might
        wait on the Blitter to be finished as this can't be done in an
        other way with these boards. For these boards WaitRtgBlit simply
        does nothing.

        Note : The source and the destination rectangle should NOT OVERLAP !!!

        Valid minterms : $30,$50,$60,$80, $C0. NO OTHER MINTERMS ARE VALID.
        OTHER MINTERMS MIGHT WORK WITH SOME SUBLIBRARIES, BUT PROBABLY NOT WITH
        ALL SUBLIBRARIES.

        Note: This function MIGHT or MIGHT NOT work with some of the Minterms
        on rtgEGS.library... at least for $C0 it works for all... for the rest...
        i do not see myself as Betatester of half-finished WB-Emulations...

        THIS FUNCTION IS IMPLEMENTED IN SUBLIBRARIES STARTING WITH VERSION 1.8

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen where the Blit should happen
        SrcBuf - The Buffer NUMBER (not address !!!) of the Source Buffer
        DstBuf - The Buffer NUMBER (not address !!!) of the Destination Buffer
        SrcX - The X coordinate of the source Rectangle
        SrcY - The Y coordinate of the source Rectangle
        DstX - The X coordinate of the Destination Rectangle
        DstY - The Y coordinate of the Destination Rectangle
        Width - The Width of the Blit
        Height - The Height of the Blit
        minterm - the minterm of the Blit, defined as usual
