        WaitRtgBlit(struct RtgScreen *)

   FUNCTION
        Waits for the GFX Board Blitter to be finished. For those who wonder,
        why RtgScreen has to be given as parameter... it probably won't be used...
        just to be on the sure side :)

        Does not do anything at all with some sublibraries. Some of them ALWAYS wait...

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen structure
