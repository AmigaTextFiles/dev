   NAME
        RtgWaitTOF - Wait for the top of the next video frame.

   SYNOPSIS
        WaitTOF(RtgScreen)
                 A0

        WaitTOF(struct RtgScreen *)

   FUNCTION
        Wait  for vertical blank to occur and all vertical blank
        interrupt routines to complete before returning to caller.

        Does not do anything at all with some sublibraries... (CyberGraphX does not
        support TOF-Waiting up to now...)

   INPUTS
        The Screen Handle of the GFX Board Screen (only in FACT needed for rtgEGS.library,
        and probably nothing much is done about it anyway... but be nice... give this
        parameter... to stay compatible :) )

   RESULTS
        Places this task on the TOF wait queue. When the vertical blank
        interrupt comes around, the interrupt service routine will fire off
        signals to all the tasks doing WaitTOF. The highest priority task
        ready will get to run then.
