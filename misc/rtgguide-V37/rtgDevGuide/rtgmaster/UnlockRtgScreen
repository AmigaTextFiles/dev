   NAME
        UnlockRtgScreen -- Unlocks a RtgScreen

   SYNOPSIS
        UnlockRtgScreen(RtgScreen)
                         A0

        UnlockRtgScreen(ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        Unlocks a previously locked RtgScreen.  If this screen hasn't
        been locked before this function will do nothing.

        LockRtgScreen() and UnlockRtgScreen() functions nest, which means
        the user must call an UnlockRtgScreen() for every LockRtgScreen().
        If not the user will end up with a permenantly locked screen.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
