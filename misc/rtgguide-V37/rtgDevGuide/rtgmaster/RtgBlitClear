   SYNOPSIS
        RtgBltClear(RtgScreen,BufNum,xpos,ypos,width,height)
                     a0        a1     d0   d1   d2    d3

        RtgBltClear(struct RtgScreen *,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        This function clears a rectangular area using the GFX Board
        blitter. For people who wonder, why i did not implement that
        the "usual" way, like done in graphics.library : The graphics.library
        function would not be possible under EGS, therefor i did it
        this way. The function usually does not wait for the Blitter,
        use WaitRtgBlit for this (unless under EGS... like explained
        in RtgBlit and WaitRtgBlit...)

        THIS FUNCTION IS IMPLEMENTED WITH SUBLIBRARIES STARTING WITH VERSION 1.8

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen
        BufNum - The NUMBER of the concerned Buffer, between 0 and 2 (NOT the buffer address !!!)
        xpos - the start x position of the rectangle to be cleared
        ypos - the start y position of the rectangle to be cleared
        width - the width of the rectangle
        height - the height of the rectangle
