   NAME
        LoadRGBRtg - changes one or more colors of a RtgScreen

   SYNOPSIS
        LoadRGBRtg(RtgScreen, Table)
                    A0         A1

        LoadRGBRtg(ULONG, APTR)

   FUNCTION
        Enables the user to change one or more colors of his/her screen.
        This function only works for RtgScreens which have a palette, and
        thus won't work for the True-color modes.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        Table - A pointer to a series of records which describe which
                colors to modify

   NOTES
        Passing a NULL Table must be ignored.  The format of the Table
        passed is a series of records, each with the this format:

           WORD  Count value: Number of colors to load
           WORD  Number of first color to be loaded

        After these two words, a list of 3 Longs follow as many times
        as specified by the first word.  These 3 longwords represent the
        left justified 32 bit RGB value.

        And then the list repeats until ended with a count value of 0.

        See for more information about the table graphics/LoadRGB32.
        This function must use the same format.
