   NAME
        WriteRtgPixel - plots a single pixel to a RtgScreen

   SYNOPSIS
        WriteRtgPixel(RtgScreen, BufferAdr, XPos, YPos, Color)
                       A0         A1         D0    D1    D2

        WriteRtgPixel(struct RtgScreen *, APTR, ULONG, ULONG, UBYTE)

   FUNCTION
        Draws a single pixel at the specified position on a RtgScreen.
        The BufferAdr is the starting address of the buffer the users wants
        to draw the pixel in.  The user has obtained this address using
        LockRtgScreen() and GetBufAdr().  The BufferAdr is needed to specify
        the correct buffer for screens which are double or triple buffered.

        This function should only work for Palette mapped modes, Color is
        the Color number of the palette.

        THIS FUNCTION IS IMPLEMENTED WITH SUBLIBRARIES STARTING WITH VERSION 1.8

        DO NOT USE FOR SPEED RELEVANT STUFF. THIS FUNCTION MAY HAVE
        SOME OVERHEAD. FOR FAST OPERATIONS USE COPYRTGPIXELARRAY OR
        DO THE STUFF YOURSELVES.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        BufferAdr - The address of the memory containing the actual
                    screen graphics
        XPos - X position of the pixel the user wants to plot
        YPos - Y position of the pixel the user wants to plot
        Color - Color number
