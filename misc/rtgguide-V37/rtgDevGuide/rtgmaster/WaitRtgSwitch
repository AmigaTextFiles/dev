   NAME
        WaitRtgSwitch - Waits on Doublebuffering having happened

   SYNOPSIS
        WaitRtgSwitch(RtgScreen)
                    A0

        WaitRtgSwitch(struct RtgScreen *)

   FUNCTION
        As SwitchScreens does not wait till the Doublebuffering has happened,
        but returns AT ONCE, it might be that the program wants to access the
        video memory BEFORE the change has happened. In this case you can use
        WaitRtgSwitch to be sure the change really happened. If you do not
        want to wait, simply do not use this call :)

        Does not do much for some sublibraries. Some always wait...

   INPUTS
        The Screenhandle of the Screen, where the Wait should happen...
