   NAME
        FillRtgRectRGB - draws a filled rectangle to a RtgScreen

   SYNOPSIS
        FillRtgRectRGB(RtgScreen, BufferAdr, Color, Left, Top, Width, Height)
                        A0         A1         D0     D1    D2   D3     D4

        FillRtgRectRGB(struct RtgScreen *, APTR, ULONG, ULONG, ULONG,
                       ULONG, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        Draws a filled rectangle at the specified position on a RtgScreen.
        The BufferAdr is the starting address of the buffer the users wants
        to draw the rectangle in.  The user has obtained this address using
        LockRtgScreen() and GetBufAdr().  The BufferAdr is needed to specify
        the correct buffer for screens which are double or triple buffered.

        This function should only work for True Color modes, Color is
        a 32 bit value which specifies what Color the pixel should be.
        The layout of this 32-bit value is as follows:

        %aaaaaaaa.rrrrrrrr.gggggggg.bbbbbbbb

        a = AlphaChannel (8-bits) which may or may not be ignored.  The
            user will set this to zero if the user doesn't want to use
            AlphaChannel.
        r = Red component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value
        g = Green component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value
        b = Blue component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value

        IMPLEMENTED WITH SUBLIBRARIES WITH AT LEAST VERSION 1.9

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        BufferAdr - The address of the memory containing the actual
                    screen graphics
        Color - A 32-bit value describing the color (see above)
        Left - X position of the top-left of the rectangle
        Top - Y position of the top-left of the rectangle
        Width - Width of the rectangle in pixels
        Height - Height of the rectangle in pixels
