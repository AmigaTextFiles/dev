   NAME
        GetRtgScreenData -- Fills a TagList with data about the RtgScreen 

   SYNOPSIS
        GetRtgScreenData(RtgScreen, TagList)
                          A0         A1

        GetRtgScreenData(ULONG, struct TagItem *)

   FUNCTION
        This function should fill the TI_DATA fields of the passed in
        TagList with the requested information.

        See for available tags and descriptions in the .i/.h file.

        NOTE: Starting with sublibrary V2.2, this function can also
        be used to find out to what BUSSYSTEM a Graphics Board is
        connected. In the original design of rtgmaster an extra function
        was intended for that, but now it is the job of GetRtgScreenData.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        TagList - TagList which should be filled in with requested info.
