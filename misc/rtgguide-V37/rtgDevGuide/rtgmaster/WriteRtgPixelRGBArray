   NAME
        WriteRtgPixelRGBArray - writes an array of pixels to a RtgScreen

   SYNOPSIS
        WriteRtgPixelRGBArray(RtgScreen, BufferAdr, Array, Left, Top, Width, Height)
                               A0         A1         A2     D0    D1   D2     D3    

        WriteRtgPixelRGBArray(struct RtgScreen *, APTR, APTR, ULONG, ULONG,
                              ULONG, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        Draws an rectangular array of pixels to the specified position on a
        RtgScreen.  The BufferAdr is the starting address of the buffer the
        user wants to draw this array of pixels in.  The user has obtained
        this address using LockRtgScreen() and GetBufAdr().  The BufferAdr is
        needed to specify the correct buffer for screens which are double or
        triple buffered.

        This function should only work for True Color modes.  The array
        consists of one longword (32-bits) per pixel, each longword specifies
        a Color in this format:

        %aaaaaaaa.rrrrrrrr.gggggggg.bbbbbbbb        

        a = AlphaChannel (8-bits) which may or may not be ignored.  The
            user will set this to zero if the user doesn't want to use
            AlphaChannel.
        r = Red component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value
        g = Green component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value
        b = Blue component (8-bits) of the 24-bit RGB value

        This function is many times faster than writing each pixel seperately
        to the screen using WriteRtgPixelRGB().

        THIS FUNCTION IS IMPLEMENTED WITH SUBLIBRARIES STARTING WITH VERSION 1.8

        DO NOT USE FOR SPEED RELEVANT STUFF. THIS FUNCTION MAY HAVE
        SOME OVERHEAD. FOR FAST OPERATIONS USE COPYRTGPIXELARRAY OR
        DO THE STUFF YOURSELVES.

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        BufferAdr - The address of the memory containing the actual
                    screen graphics
        Array - Pointer to an array of pixels which is Width pixels wide, 
                and Height pixels high.  Each pixel is one longword (32-bits)
                in size.
        Left - X position of the top-left of the rectangular pixel array
        Top - Y position of the top-left of the rectangular pixel array
        Width - Width of the array in pixels
        Height - Height of the array in pixels
