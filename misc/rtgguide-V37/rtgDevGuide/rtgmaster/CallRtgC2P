   NAME
        CallRtgC2P -- Perform c2p for Planar Screens, CopyRtgPixelArray for Chunky Screens

   SYNOPSIS
        int CallRtgC2P(RtgScreen,BufAdr,Array,signal,xpos,ypos,width,height,mode)
         D0              A0        A1     A2    D0     D1   D2   D3    D4     D5

        int CallRtgC2P(struct RtgScreen *,APTR,APTR,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG,ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        This function will look what the "standard c2p" for the system is up to now
        (the standard c2p can be choose by a future version of the Rtgmaster Screenmode
        requester, the available c2p algorithms are found in libs:rtgc2p, how own c2p
        algorithms can be added to the system will be explained in the documentation
        of the first version of rtgmaster.library that actually supports CallRtgC2P).
        The function will, if the display is a Planar one, convert the Chunky Data in
        Array to Planar using the choosen c2p algorithm, and display it in the choosen
        Buffer. For Chunky Displays it will instead do the same as CopyRtgChunkyPixel.
        This way a very easy possibility to support both AGA and Graphics Boards without
        having to do "special versions" will be available, if one uses a Fastram Buffer.

        I am still looking for c2p algorithms for this function !!! All used c2p algorithms
        should support AGA and additional, it would be fine, if they supported
        1x1,1x2,2x1 and 2x2. If you have fine c2p algorithms, mail me
        (MagicSN@birdland.es.bawue.de).

        NOTE : The Array should EXACTLY be as big as specified with Left, Top, Width
        and Height... it should *NOT* be bigger.

        NOTE: Currently you *HAVE TO* use xpos=0 ypos=0 width=<max x> height=<max y>
        Maybe this will change in the future !!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is only because i do
        not have ANY c2p that supports that feature up to now...

        NOTE: Some c2p algorithms might do NOTHING in certain colour depths, chunky modes
        or for interleaved bitmaps. Be careful about this. If the c2p works,
        this function returns 0, otherwise an errorcode.

        Principially it COULD support 256, 64 (EHB), 32 or 16 colors and 1x1, 1x2, 2x1,
        2x2,4x2,2x4 and 4x4 (look at the includes). It is also possible to choose the
        FASTEST AVAILABLE, the BEST AVAILABLE mode or the mode that was selected from
        the user as standard mode for his system, using the Screenmode Requester.

        If the user did not specify a standard c2p, this function will use the fastest
        available mode.

        The signal indicates (for asynchrone c2p) that the c2p has done. For synchrone
        ones it is set after quitting the function.

        In mode you specify which c2p mode to use.

        For Graphics Boards, ALWAYS 1x1 is used.

        IMPLEMENTED WITH SUBLIBRARIES WITH AT LEAST VERSION 2.0 (none up to now...)

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen to use.
        BufAdr - The address of the buffer to use
        Array - The fastram buffer
        Left - The x position on the Bitmap of RtgScreen where to put the stuff
        Top - The y position
        Width - The Width of the stuff
        Height - The Height of the stuff
