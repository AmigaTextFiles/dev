   NAME
        RtgInitBob - Initializes a RtgBob

   SYNOPSIS
        RtgInitBob(RtgScreen, RtgBob,BackAdr,BufferAdr,xpos,ypos,display)
                    A0         A1      A2     A3       D0    D1   D2

        RtgInitBob(struct RtgBob *)

   FUNCTION
        Initializes a RtgBob for display. This has to be done before using a
        RtgBob. If the Bob was already initted, the Bob is simply moved
        to the position given (but you can init and display it in the
        same function call, also). BackAdr is the BackBuffer to be used
        with the Bob, this BackBuffer CANNOT be used for Doublebuffering
        or other purposes (but you can use a Fastram-Buffer as Backbuffer,
        also). You only have to supply the BackBuffer the first time you
        use the Bob.

        Rtgmaster Bobs are limited to 32x32 resolutions.

        Not yet implemented.

   INPUTS
        RtgBob    - The RtgBob structure
        BackAdr   - The VideoRAM or FastRAM Buffer for Bob Refresh
        BufferAdr - The Video RAM Buffer, where the Bob should be displayed
        xpos      - The xposition the Bob should be placed
        ypos      - The yposition the Bob should be placed
        display   - If this is 1, the Bob will be switched on, if 0, it will
                    be disabled.
