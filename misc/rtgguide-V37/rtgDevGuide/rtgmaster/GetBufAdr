   NAME
        GetBufAdr -- Get the address for one of the buffers from a
                     multi-buffered RtgScreen

   SYNOPSIS
        address = GetBufAdr(RtgScreen, Buffer)
         D0                  A0         D0

        APTR GetBufAdr(ULONG, ULONG)

   FUNCTION
        If the user is using multi-buffered screens, it might be usefull
        to know where the two buffers start in memory.  After a
        LockRtgScreen() the user can call this function with a RtgScreen
        handle and a number to get the address of the corresponding
        buffer.

        The address is only valid if the RtgScreen is currently locked
        using LockRtgScreen().

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - A handle for a valid screen previously opened by
                    this sublibrary's OpenRtgScreen() function.
        Buffer - The buffer number the user wants the address of

   RESULTS
        address - the address of the buffer, or NULL for failure
