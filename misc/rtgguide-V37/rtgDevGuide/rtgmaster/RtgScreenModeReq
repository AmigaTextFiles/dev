   NAME
        RtgScreenModeReq -- Opens a ScreenMode requester

   SYNOPSIS
        ScreenReq = RtgScreenModeReq(ScreenModeTags)
         D0                           A0

        struct ScreenReq *RtgScreenModeReq(struct TagItem *)

   FUNCTION
        Opens a ScreenMode requester which displays all available
        ScreenModes to the user, depending on the Tags which are passed
        to this function.  The functions returns a pointer to a
        ScreenReq structure or NULL for failure or if the user
        cancelled the requester.

        The ScreenReq holds various information which the user selected,
        like width, height, screenmode and depth.

        THIS FUNCTION IS ONLY IN THE MASTER-LIBRARY. It handles the Screenmodes
        for ALL sublibraries.

        Note: The Screenmode-Requester provided with an early Beta of the
        rtgmaster.library was VERY buggy. It got completely replaced by
        a new one for this version of the library.

   INPUTS
        ScreenModeTags - Pointer to (an array of) TagItem structures,
                         terminated by the value TAG_END (0).

        The description for the various tags can be found in the .i/.h
        file (smr_Tags). NOTE: The Tags changed a lot since the early
        Beta release of the library.

   RESULTS
        ScreenReq - A pointer to a ScreenReq structure or NULL for
                    failure
