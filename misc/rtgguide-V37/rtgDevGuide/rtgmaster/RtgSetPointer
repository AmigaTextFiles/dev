   NAME
        RtgSetPointer - sets the pointer to a new image

   SYNOPSIS
        RtgSetPointer(RtgScreen,pointer,Width,Height,OffsetX,OffsetY)
                         A0      A1      D0    D1     D2      D3

        void RtgSetPointer(struct RtgScreen *,UWORD *,WORD,WORD,WORD,WORD)

   FUNCTION
        This function sets the mousepointer to a new image for this RtgScreen.
        The structure pointer is exactly the same like taken from intuition.library
        command SetPointer (the data definition of a Simple Sprite). Different
        from this only is that the image HAS TO BE 16x18 pixels size. If you
        want a smaller pointer, modify the Width/Height values and set that
        pixels that you do not need to 0. But the SIZE of the structure has
        to be 16x18 pixels (72 Bytes). An example :

        UWORD Hoehe[2]
        {
            0x...,0x... // first line
            ...
            0x...,0x... // 18th line
        }

        Look at graphics.library SimpleSprite documentation for more information
        (01,10,11 are the three pointer colors,00 is transperent, each of
        the two words of a line determines ONE BIT of the 2-Bit mousepointer).

   INPUTS
        RtgScreen - The RtgScreen, which pointer should be resetted...
        pointer   - pointer image, see above
        Width     - Actual Width of the pointer
        Height    - Actual Height of the pointer
        OffsetX   - Display Offset for the pointer, from the mouseposition
        OffsetY   - Display Offset for the pointer, from the mouseposition

   NOTES
       Not implemented yet on rtgPICA.library and rtgEGS.library

       Do NOT specifically demand Chipram for the pointer array.
       Else your program won't run on the DraCo. rtgmaster.library will
       handle this itself, that the pointer-image will end in
       Chipram for ECS/AGA, in ANYTHING AVAILABLE on GFX Board system.
       So simply allocate RAM for the pointer image, without simply
       demanding Chipram or Fastram (as DraCo needs FastRam, and
       ECS/AGA need Chipram here... but well... rtgmaster.library
       takes care of this :) )
