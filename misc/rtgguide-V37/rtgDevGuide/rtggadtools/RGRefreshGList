   NAME

   SYNOPSIS
       RGRefreshGList(anchor, gadget, num);
                      A0      A1      D0
       void RGRefreshGList(APTR, RGGadget, LONG);

   FUNCTION
       Refresh a number of gadgets (redraw them), starting from gadget
       in anchor, drawing num gadgets. The gadgets are drawn in every
       available buffer to fix problems with double buffering.

   INPUTS
       anchor  -   A valid Anchor structure
       gadget  -   A gadget within this anchor, or NULL for all gadgets
       num     -   Number of gadgets to draw. May be -1 to redraw all
                   gadgets after gadget.

   RESULT
       This function does not have a return value.

   EXAMPLE
       see example programs

   NOTES
       Handling gadgets consistantly on multi-buffered screens is a
       bit of a problem with the minimal control RTGGadTools has
       over the screen switching process. Therefore, every time a
       gadget is redrawn, it is redrawn in every buffer. This should
       not pose too much overhead, since gadgets are usually small.
       This behavior might change in future version.


   BUGS
       None known.
