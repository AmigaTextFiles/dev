   NAME   
       RGNewGadget -- Create a new RTGGadTools Gadget (V1)

   SYNOPSIS
       gadget = RGNewGadget(tags);
       D0                   A0
       RGGadget RGNewGadget(struct TagItem *);

       gadget = RGNewGadgetTags(tag1...);
       RGGadget RGNewGadget(Tag ...);

   FUNCTION
       This function creates a new gadget with the parameters given
       in the taglist. The gadget's parameters must be passed via a
       taglist. Ommitted parameters will be given default values.

   INPUTS
       This functions accepts the following tag items:

       RGG_LeftEdge
       RGG_TopEdge
       RGG_Width
       RGG_Height          (ULONG)
           The Obvious. If you don't specify LeftEdge or TopEdge,
           zero will be assumed. Width and Height are calculated to
           the best of knowledge when the gadget is created, but
           this is very likely to break. Better specify everything.

       RGG_RenderText      (STRPTR)
           Gives a text string that should be rendered inside the
           gadget

       RGG_RenderImage     (APTR)
           The rectangular area pointed to by his tag value is to be
           used as the source for a WritePixelArray/WritePixelRGBArray
           when rendering this gadget. Note that you *MUST* specify
           Width and Height if you want to use this feature. See
           also RGG_SelectRender

       RGG_SelectRender    (APTR)
           Gives a pointer to an alternate image to be drawn when the
           button is pressed. Only valid if a RGG_RenderImage was given,
           will be ignored otherwise. Images should match in size, or
           you will get artefacts from improper deleting images.

       RGG_UpAction        (function or ULONG)
           Depending on the flags value, the value of this tag item
           is interpreted either as a function which is to be called
           when the gadget is pressed (if the RGF_UpAction flag is set)
           or an ULONG which is returned by RGDoGadgets(). This function
           is called with a pointer to the gadget structure in register
           a0.

       RGG_DownAction      (function or ULONG)
           Same as RGG_UpAction when the gadget is released...

       RGG_RenderHook      (function pointer)
           When this TagItem is given, the value is interpreted as a
           function that gets called whenever the gadget needs to be
           rendered. The function is called with these parameters:

           A0: Pointer to the gadget structure

           It is completely up to you what this function does. You should
           however examine the flags word in the gadget structure and
           take care of the RGF_Selected and RGF_Disabled flags when
           rendering...

       RGG_HitTest         (function pointer)
           If you need arbitrarily shaped gadgets, you can insert your
           own hittest here. Normally, gadgets assume they are hit
           if their HitBox got clicked. If you want parts of your gadget
           to react different, supply this method. The function gets
           called with these parameters:

           A0:     Pointer to the gadget structure
           D0/D1:  X/Y coords of mouse hit.

           The coordinates you receive are absolute screen coordinates,
           and there's no guarantee that they are within you bounding
           box. This means that you could (theoretically) create gadgets
           with hit areas bigger than their bounding box. This is, however,
           considered bad behaviour.

           You should clear D0 on return to indicate your gadget has
           been missed, or TRUE otherwise.

       RGG_Flags           (ULONG)
           One of the #define'd flags. See rtggadtools.h

       RGG_HiPen
       RGG_LoPen
       RGG_TextPen         (UWORD)
           A pen value (i.e. 0..2^depth) for the "highlighted" edges of
           the 3D frame, "shadowed edges" and the text color, respectively


   RESULT
       gadget  -   NULL in case an error occured during creation.
                   otherwise an RGGadget.

   EXAMPLE

   NOTES
       The RGGadget structure is read_only. You may not directly modify
       the values, use RGSetAttr().

   BUGS
       Many, probably.
