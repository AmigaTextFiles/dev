   NAME
        OpenServer - Opens a TCP/IP Server

   SYNOPSIS
        Socket=OpenServer(SBase,port,mode,protocol)
         D0                A0    D0   D1   D2

        struct TCP_Connect *OpenServer(struct Library *,int,int,int)

   FUNCTION
        For TCP this function opens a "virtual connection" between two applications.
        For UDP it creates a server that UDP clients can access.

        This function is the "Server part" of the connection. The protocol
        being used is TCP/IP. Up to now, as to the "transport protocol", only
        TCP is supported, no UDP (maybe in a future version ???)
        For more information, look at the docs. There is a chapter about
        "TCP/IP programming for newcomers", that shows you, how to support
        netework gaming for your computer game, even if you never heard of
        TCP/IP before :) Up to now rtgmaster.library only supports the
        "protocol stack" AmiTCP, no AS225 support up to now.  Runs for sure
        with AmiTCP 4.0 demo from Aminet, i do not know about earlier versions.

        NOTE: It might appear strange to you, that you have to open bsdsocket.library
        yourselves and provide it as parameter. This is needed because of some internal
        problems of AmiTCP, that make it IMPOSSIBLE opening it inside a library. Look
        at the Docs for more information.

        You do NOT have to use rtgmaster.library's Graphics Board features to
        use rtgmaster.library's TCP/IP features, if you do not WANT to...

        Actually this function is now inside rtgextra.library.

   INPUTS
        SBase    - Result of the call (C Syntax here...)
                   SBase = OpenLibrary("bsdsocket.library",0);
        port     - The port your application uses. For example 4000.
                   Be sure to use a number bigger than 3000, small numbers
                   are often used for different protocols in TCP/IP. For example
                   21 is telnet.
        mode     - The mode of the connection. Up to now only SOCK_STREAM is
                   supported ("virtual connection using a datastream").
                   SOCK_DGRAM probably will give you a UDP connection, but
                   i do not know enough about UDP to make this really working...
                   maybe in a future version...
        protocol - The protocol To be used. Set this to 0 currently.
                   mode SOCK_STREAM and protocol 0 will result in a TCP connection.

   RESULTS
        Socket   - The "Socket" of the Application. See more in the docs.
