   NAME
        CloseServer -- Closes the Server of a TCP/IP connection again

   SYNOPSIS
        CloseServer(SBase,Socket)
                     A0    A1

        CloseServer(struct Library *,struct TCP_Socket *)

   FUNCTION
        Terminates a "virtual connection" of TCP/IP and gives the Socket of the Server
        back to the system. For UDP it only gives the socket back to the system, as
        for UDP there is no connection to terminate.

        NOTE: It might appear strange to you, that you have to open bsdsocket.library
        yourselves and provide it as parameter. This is needed because of some internal
        problems of AmiTCP, that make it IMPOSSIBLE opening it inside a library. Look
        at the Docs for more information.

        You do NOT have to use rtgmaster.library's Graphics Board features to
        use rtgmaster.library's TCP/IP features, if you do not WANT to...

   INPUTS
        SBase    - Result of the call (C Syntax here...)
                   SBase = OpenLibrary("bsdsocket.library",0);
        Socket   - The Socket of the Client you want to close.
                   You should ONLY use this function for Servers,
                   NOT FOR CLIENTS !!!
