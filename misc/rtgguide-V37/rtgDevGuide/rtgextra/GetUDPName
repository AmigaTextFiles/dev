   NAME
        GetUDPName - Get the sockaddr_in structure of a UDP Client/Server

   SYNOPSIS
        name = GetUDPName(SocketBase, sock)
                    A0          A1

        struct sockaddr_in *GetUDPName(struct Library *, struct RTG_Socket *)

   FUNCTION
        If this is UDP, you will get the sockaddr_in structure of a Client/Server,
        else you will get 0. For what this is intended, read RtgRecv/RtgSend/RtgInAdr.
        And of course the Docs of rtgmaster.library where detailed information about
        TCP, IP and UDP is found.

        NOTE: It might appear strange to you, that you have to open bsdsocket.library
        yourselves and provide it as parameter. This is needed because of some internal
        problems of AmiTCP, that make it IMPOSSIBLE opening it inside a library. Look
        at the Docs for more information.

        You do NOT have to use rtgmaster.library's Graphics Board features to
        use rtgmaster.library's TCP/IP features, if you do not WANT to...

        Actually this function is now inside rtgextra.library

   INPUTS
        SBase    - Result of the call (C Syntax here...)
                   SBase = OpenLibrary("bsdsocket.library",0);
        Socket   - The Socket of the Client you want to close.
                   You should ONLY use this function for Clients,
                   NOT FOR SERVERS !!!

   RESULTS
        name     - The sockaddr_in structure of the Client/Server
