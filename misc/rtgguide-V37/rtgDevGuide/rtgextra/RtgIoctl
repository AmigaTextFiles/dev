   NAME
        RtgIoctl - Set a Socket to "Blocking" or to "Non-Blocking" mode

   SYNOPSIS
        result = RtgIoctl(SBase,Socket,arg)
         D0                A0    A1     A2

        int RtgIoctl(struct Library *,struct RTG_Socket *,long *)

   FUNCTION
        This function determins, if RtgRecv and RtgSend will WAIT will the data
        was transmitted, or if they fail, if the data currently could not be
        transmitted. If arg POINTS to the VALUE 1, we have "non-blocking" (it does
        not wait), if it POINTS to 0, we have "blocking" (it waits). Default (if
        you do not call RtgIoctl at all) is "blocking".

        NOTE: It might appear strange to you, that you have to open bsdsocket.library
        yourselves and provide it as parameter. This is needed because of some internal
        problems of AmiTCP, that make it IMPOSSIBLE opening it inside a library. Look
        at the Docs for more information.

        You do NOT have to use rtgmaster.library's Graphics Board features to
        use rtgmaster.library's TCP/IP features, if you do not WANT to...

        RtgIoctl is a VERY CPU TIME INTENSIVE FUNCTION !!!
        Only call it during the INITIALIZATION of the network !!!

        My suggestion : Run the server in "blocking" mode, the Clients in
        "nonblocking" mode... seems to be the fastest...

        Actually this function is now inside rtgextra.library.

   INPUTS
        SBase    - Result of the call (C Syntax here...)
                   SBase = OpenLibrary("bsdsocket.library",0);
        Socket   - The Socket of the application, which socket is to be modified
        arg      - "Non-Blocking" or "Blocking" (a pointer)

   RESULTS
        result   - 0 on success, -1 on fail (should not fail,normally...)
