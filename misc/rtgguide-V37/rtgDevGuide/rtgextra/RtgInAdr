   NAME
        RtgInAdr - Find out the IP Address of a Receiver/Sender

   SYNOPSIS
        ip = RtgInAdr(SBase,si)
        D0             A0   A1

        char *RtgInAdr(struct Library *,struct sockaddr_in *)

   FUNCTION
        This function finds out the IP Address of a Receiver/Sender.
        You get back the sockaddr_in structure of a receiver/sender by
        RtgRecv/RtgSend or by using GetUDPName. This function ONLY
        works for UDP, not for TCP !!! It is used to differentiate
        Clients running on different machines from each other, if
        one does a Multiple Client "connection" (should not be called
        like that, as UDP is connectionless, but do you know a better
        term ?), without using RunServer...

        Of course this function can't differentiate multiple Clients
        running on the same machine...

        NOTE: It might appear strange to you, that you have to open bsdsocket.library
        yourselves and provide it as parameter. This is needed because of some internal
        problems of AmiTCP, that make it IMPOSSIBLE opening it inside a library. Look
        at the Docs for more information.

        You do NOT have to use rtgmaster.library's Graphics Board features to
        use rtgmaster.library's TCP/IP features, if you do not WANT to...

        Actually this function is now inside rtgextra.library.

   INPUTS
          SBase    - Result of the call (C Syntax here...)
                     SBase = OpenLibrary("bsdsocket.library",0);
          si       - Special structure returned by above mentioned calls

   RESULTS
          ip       - IP Address as string (for example "194.55.101.26")
