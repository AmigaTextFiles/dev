   NAME
        RtgAccept - Let the server accept a connection deminded by a Client

   SYNOPSIS
        Socket=RtgAccept(SBase,Socket)
         D0               A0    A1

        struct RTG_Socket *RtgAccept(struct Library *,struct RTG_Socket *)

   FUNCTION
        if you do not use the RunServer function (you do not use it, if you only
        do a point-to-point connection), you have to do this call on Server side
        to wait for the Client to connect. If you use RunSercer, DO NOT USE IT. It
        is only for connecting exactly TWO systems (one being  the server, one the
        client), not for connecting ONE server with SEVERAL clients...

        Also do not use it for UDP connection. RtgAccept is only needed for TCP.
        It does not work with UDP.

        NOTE: It might appear strange to you, that you have to open bsdsocket.library
        yourselves and provide it as parameter. This is needed because of some internal
        problems of AmiTCP, that make it IMPOSSIBLE opening it inside a library. Look
        at the Docs for more information.

        You do NOT have to use rtgmaster.library's Graphics Board features to
        use rtgmaster.library's TCP/IP features, if you do not WANT to...

        Actually this function is now inside rtgextra.library.


   INPUTS
        SBase    - Result of the call (C Syntax here...)
                   SBase = OpenLibrary("bsdsocket.library",0);
        Socket   - the Socket of the Server

    RESULTS
        Socket   - The "Socket" of the Client, that connected. See more in the docs.
