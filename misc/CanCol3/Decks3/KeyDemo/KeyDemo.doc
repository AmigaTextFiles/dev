About the KeyDemo:

  To examine how this deck runs, you will need to have the KeyInput Object
(probably found on the same BBS as you found this deck.)
  
  The first card is mearly instructions, printed from within the card's
AfterStartUp script.

  The second card is the example.  In the AfterStartUp, a shape is drawn
to the screen and then clipped as a brush for further use.  The variables
describing velocity and acceleration are also initialized at this point.
  A Timer Object is used to update the objects position.  This first updates
the X and Y, based on the velocity and acceleration, and then redraws the
image. 
  The KeyInput Objects can be found by pressing on the Xtra button on 
CanDo's main panel, and requesting to perform the KeyInput.  You will see
a list of KeyInput Objects.  I think you find that their names are self
explanatory.

  I hope you enjoy this simple example of KeyInput.
