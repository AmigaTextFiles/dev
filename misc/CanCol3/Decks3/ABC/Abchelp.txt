ABC is a text alphabetizer.   Because it works with text files, it's a 
good replacement for having to retype a list of items from a text file
into a database program just because you want it alphabetized.  Use
ABC to alphabetize your text file lists of your disks, BBS numbers,
records, cassettes, books, videos, or whatever.

Use "Set Mark 1" and then "Set Mark 2" under the document menu
to set the area in which you would like ABC to alphabetize.  Then
select "Alphabetize" under the Sort menu.  That's it.  You can also
change what column you want ABC to sort on; all characters to the left
to the specified column will be ignored during the sort.
