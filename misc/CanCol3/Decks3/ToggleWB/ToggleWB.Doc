ToggleWB
Written by James Nelson, INOVAtronics, Inc.

This utility serves the single purpose of closing the Workbench screen if
it is open, and openning the Workbench screen if it is closed.  This
ability is handy for any application in which the Workbench screen with
clutter the display, or where limited CHIP memory is required.

To use this utility from within a CanDo application, first copy ToggleWB to
your sys:c directory, then within your application use a dos command as
follows:

  dos "ToggleWB"

If no other application has a window open on the Workbench screen, then
this command will shut down the Workbench screen if it is open, or it will
open the Workbench screen if it is closed.  If you find that the Workbench
screen is not closing, then check to see if any other applications are
running on the Workbench screen, and make sure that your own screen is open
(don't use this command from within the OnStartup, as your screen will not
yet be open.)

Included here is a sample Deck to demonstrate how to use this utility.  It is
recommended that it is run from the Workbench.

You will not need to run this utility before closing, as the Amiga will
open Workbench automatically if no other screens are open.
