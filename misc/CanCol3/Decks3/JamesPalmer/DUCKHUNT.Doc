                   The CanDo DuckHunt

   This is a freely distributable game, which was created using
CanDo. The object of the game is to hit as many of the 26 ducks
as possible. For each bird shot you get 50 points. For every
duck that gets away, you lose 25 points. The highest possible
score is 1300, while the lowest possible score is -650. After
the game is over it will ask you to enter your name. If your
score was good enough it is added to the list. If your score
does not qualify it will simply be displayed below the top 5
list. To play the game you need to assign DUCKHUNT: to this
directory and then double click on the CanDoDUCKHUNT icon.

   When the game begins you have some options. The 2 icons for
computer type are only to tell whether or not your computer is
accelerated. If it is select 3000, if it isn't select 1000. The
memory icons are not really "true" either. The program will work
on 512 with music, but it becomes very slow and unaccurate, so I
added the "512" version which has no sound. Some people tell me
the music I have chosen is annoying anyway. To quit the game wait
until you are at the title screen if there isn't currently a quit
menu.

   Finally I would like to take this moment to thank everyone who
gave me input, advice, or help on this project. Enjoy!
