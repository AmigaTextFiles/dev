Most people don't know this but CanDo supports Minterms.  Here is how to
get at them and a simple deck to show off what they can do.  First you will
need to know how to set the minterm.  The ShowBrush command is documented
as follows:

ShowBrush "brushname" ,<x> ,<y> {,BRUSHPALETTE}

This will show a brush at the given location and also allow you to change
the palette of the current screen to the brush's palette.  Well, here is the
actual syntax of the ShowBrush command:

ShowBrush "brushname" ,<x> ,<y> {,BRUSHPALETTE | PICTUREPALETTE {,<minterm>}}

If you give the ShowBrush command the flag PICTUREPALETTE it will simply
ignore the brush's palette.  But you will notice that there is a fifth
argument for the ShowBrush command.  In order to set the minterm you must
first use one of the PALETTE flags.  Here is an example:

LoadBrush "Dpaint:Brushes/TheClip.Grab","SillyPic"
ShowBrush "SillyPic",50,50,PicturePalette,32

In the above example you first load the brush then show it at 50,50 using
the screen's palette but BLIT it to the screen using 32 as a minterm.

What is a minterm?
  A minterm is a value that tells the drawing system of the Amiga how to
  draw (or BLIT) the brush.  Some minterms are rather strange; others can
  be useful.

A valid minterm is any number from 0 to 255 that is an even multiple of
the number 16 (0,16,32,48,...,240).  The minterm zero (0) is special to
CanDo.  If you use the minterm zero(0) CanDo will use it's built-in default
minterm.

You will get different results with your minterms depending on the state of
transparency.  So try each minterm out under both conditions.


Another Interesting fact about CanDo:

If the brush you are showing is less bitplanes deep than the screen it is
being shown on then only the bitplanes common to them both will be changed.
For example:

  Brush has only 3 bit planes (8 colors)
    \     ________             ________
     \|  /       /            /       /
    ¯¯  /       //           /       //
       /       ///          /       ///
      /       ///          /       ////
      /¯¯¯¯¯¯¯//           /¯¯¯¯¯¯¯///
      /¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/       __   /¯¯¯¯¯¯¯//
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯         /|  /¯¯¯¯¯¯¯/
                      /    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                    But the screen has 4 bit planes (16 colors)

When the ShowBrush occurs only the top three bitplanes of the screen will
be modified by the brush's bitplanes.  This means any data (pixels) in the
fourth bitplane will be left untouched by the BLIT.  On the other hand, if
you use a brush that has more bitplanes than the screen, the brush's
extra bitplanes are ignored.
