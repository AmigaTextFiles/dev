Description:

This is a deck which causes a sound file to play whenever you insert or eject
a disk.  Although this is quite easy to do with CanDo, the deck is interesting
from a programming standpoint because the names of the sound files are stored
in the decks icon as tool types.  CanDo has a command for putting the entire
tool type list in a document, but using the information in a program is a 
little more difficult, so that part is worth a look.  Also, the close gadget
is doing double-duty here -- when it is clicked it brings up another card 
with buttons for setting the file names, playing sounds, and of course,
exiting the program.  I started with the ClockBar deck from the original
CanDo distribution disks.

Installation:

Two sound files are included in the Zip file.  These sound files were orig-
inally located in the CanDo/Sounds directory, as you can see by the tool
types in the deck icon.  If you want to put them somewhere else, you can do it
in two ways: modify the deck icon with the info command from workbench, or
start the deck running, click on the close gadget, and use the buttons to set
the "Disk In" sound and the "Disk Out" sound (the easy way).  You may also
have to change where the deck looks for DeckRunner/DeckBrowser.

Bugs:

If the icon file does not have something for tooltypes when the program starts
it will cause problems.  The filename does not have to be valid, but it does
have to be there.

I originally tried to add menus to the deck, but for some reason the menu 
commands did not work well with the clockbar card.  The colors could not be
set properly, so you could not read the menu entries.

Other than these, no other bugs have been found.
