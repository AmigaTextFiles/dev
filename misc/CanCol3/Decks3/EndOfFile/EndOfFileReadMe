Hello,

  Here is a sample CanDo Deck to demonstrate the use of the command IfError
to detect an End-of-File.
  To help you understand how it works, I'll explain its basic function.
When you run the deck, you must press a Button to continue.  A file
requester will appear asking for the name of the a text file to view.  The
Script checks if the file exists, and that it is of unknown type, which
I assume is an ASCII text file.  If the file exists, it is opened and
the script goes to the card named OpenIt.  OpenIt contains a Document Object
which is used to display each line of the selected file.  OpenIt uses a
reoccurring Timer Object which contains a script to read in a line of text
from the file and checks for the end of the file.  If it is not an end of
file, the line is typed into the Document being displayed.  Each time the
Timer occurs, this script repeats.
  This example is an unbound Deck.  If you own CanDo, use DeckRunner to
run the Deck.  If you do not own CanDo, use DeckBrowser.
  The scripts in this Deck are commented, so feel free to study them from
within CanDo.
