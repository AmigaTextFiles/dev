                              Answer Me! 

	Answer Me! is a CanDo Deck that you can use to make your own quiz,
	save it, and then answer it. 


			   The Pick Screen

	After the intro screen, you will see the Pick Screen. This is
        where you will see a list of all the quizzes available, and also
	the number of questions in the choosen quiz. If there is no quiz,
	will have to go to the List Maker to create at least one. 
	(Use the pull-down menu).


                           The List Maker

	This is where you create your quiz. Enter the file name for your
	quiz (This name will appear as the Subject (Title) of your quiz
	later on. So it is a good idea to save it like this: "File Name"),
	not more than 16 characters, and the number of questions for this
	quiz (From 1 to 999).

	Enter your question and your answer, press Next after they
	both look alright. They can be upper/lowercase. Repeat as 
	necessary. The question can be up to 30 characters. The answer
	up to 20 characters.

	After this, save your quiz with the Save button. The program will
	save your quiz in the current directory like this: "File Name.AM".
	The extension .AM is given to each quiz that is created. It wont
	appear on the Pick Screen. The program also will update a file
	called Menu, also in the current directory. This file hold all
	the names of your quizzes and the number of questions in each
	of them.

	Go back then to the Pick Screen, via the pull-down menu. Make
	your choice and the next stop is ShowTime!

		
				ShowTime!
	
	The quiz that you chose in the Pick Screen will appear as the
	"Subject:". The program will then mix all the questions in
	your quiz ("I am thinking ..."). So, each time that you use the
	same quiz, each questions _should_ appear in a random fashion.
	
	Then the question will appear. After this, the scrambled answer
	will appear to help you find the answer. Ex: The unscrambled
	answer could be "Fate" and the scrambled one "taFe". Here also,
	the scrambling will be random. Note: If there is a space in the
	answer you will see a _ instead in the scrambled text. When
	you type your answer you use the normal space NOT the _. (Why?
	Well, if a space show up in the scrambled answer at the last
	position, you wont be able to see it; wouldnt you?)

	All you have to do now, is type your answer. It can be upper/lower-
	case; it won't affect the result. Press the <RETURN> key and the
	program will evaluate your answer and display a corresponding
	message. To go to the next question, press the Next button or
	press the N key. (NOTE: CanDo programmers, you need the KeyInput
	object to use this function and the next one.) If it was your
	last question, you can press either the End button or the E key.
	
	You can leave the ShowTime! screen whenever you want or End it.
	Look at the pull-down menu for the choices available. If you
	End (It is not a Quit), you will then receive your grades for
	the quiz. 

				More Notes

	There is no way (yet) to delete a quiz that you don't want
	anymore. If there is sufficient interest for this Deck, I
	will add this option. You can do it manually by editing the
	Menu file and deleting the "File To Delete.AM" file.

	Included with the AnswerMe Deck are 3 demo files:
	- Amiga Computer.AM
	- Deutch Sprechen.AM
	- Parlons Français.AM

	Just keep them all together with the Menu file and everything
	will (should?) work fine ...

	Note to non-CanDo users: You will have to change the default
	Tool to c:DeckBrowser to run this Deck.
