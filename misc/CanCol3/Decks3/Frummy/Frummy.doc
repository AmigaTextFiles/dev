	From the title screen you may choose from the menu
	bar or use the keyboard equivilents to begin the game.

	You are dealt a hand of seven cards.  If you can add up
	any number of the cards in your hand to equal exactly one, 
	you may play the hand.  You get 50 points for each "whole"
	you complete.  Once "Play Hand" is chosen, you are in "Play
	Mode" until you click on enough cards to equal or exceed one.

	If you cannot play your hand, you may take the discard by
	clicking on the card in your hand that you wish to
	exchange for it.
	
	When there are no more cards you will see empty spots filled
	with face-down cards.  When you can no longer play, click
	the "New Game" button.

	This version is a one level, one player game.  Competition
	is a great incentive for learning.  If you are interested in
	the two-player, enhanced game, please send $25 to:
