The CanDo Senso was inspired by the PD program Senso-Pro.

While it was a nice game, there were several things I didn't
like about it.  So I spent a couple of evenings making this
version with CanDo.  The original must have taken the author
a long time to generate the 110,000 byte program.  My Deck is
only 13K!

One trick I used may need explaining if you plan to load it
into CanDo and hack.  (By the way, feel free to change it
any way you like.)  I do not use any ILBM pictures.  The
first card draws the image and uses the ClipPicture to create
a buffer called "DF1:Senso-Main.ilbm".  The Other cards use
this as a Picture Window.

To do this, I had to have a valid ILBM, by this name, to use 
CanDo's file requester to select this name.  CanDo verifies
the file exists, and that it is a valid ILBM.  Because the 
previously clipped picture, with the same buffer name, is in 
memory, the ILBM is not loaded.  This allow the Card to have
a Picture window for a Picture created entirely within CanDo.

The Digitized sound files were created with Audo Master II.

The Deck can be freely ditributed and modified with CanDo.

This Deck proves to me that CanDo - Will Do!
