This CanDo program will mount a little "vanity" window in the upper
right corner of your screen, out of the way of your editor/compiler,
I hope. Clicking in the window will activate pull-down reminders of
C language keywords, specs, Amiga window structs, etc. The program
looks for the logical device CanDo: as well as the directory Images
within CanDo:  Copy the #?.br files into the Images directory and
assign CanDo: appropriately. This archive includes the deck and 
images only. You need CanDo or the CanDo Browser program to make it
work.
