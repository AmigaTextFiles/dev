                               VideoLib 1.0

- This CanDo Deck will keep a list of your Video movies. It will also
permit you to print the principal information of this list. (The TITLE of
the movie, its FORMAT and the METER reading).

- To run the Deck, you must have either Deckbrowser (The default TOOL of
the Deck) or if you have the CanDo.Library, DeckRunner. Dont forget to
change the VideoLib1.0 Deck default TOOL if you use DeckRunner.

- Place VideoLib1.0 and its VidSupport drawer together anywhere you want.
Just make sure that they stay together. VidSupport holds the brushes
needed by VideoLib1.0 and the text file VideoData.Txt, which hold all
the data about your movies. VideoLib1.0 will look for this file after its
startup, so it is a good idea to save your data file with this name, in
the VidSupport drawer. An example file is included.

- You can do whatever you want with this deck. It is not binded, so you
can modify it with CanDo.

- Take a look at the "About" submenu of "Title List" for the proper
credits. Like it says, most of the code is from other decks, I only
modified it a bit ...

- Also: You can enter up to 40 characters in most of the fields. The
exceptions: TAPE #, FORMAT, METER = 4 chars. RATING = 2 chars.
