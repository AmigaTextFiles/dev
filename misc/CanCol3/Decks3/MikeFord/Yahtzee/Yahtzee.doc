I. HOW TO PLAY
    1. Type in the NUMBER OF PLAYERS and the PLAYER NAMES in the string
 gadgets provided and then click the PLAY A GAME gadget. 

After a small pause, the game screen will appear. At the top of the screen
 is a three line status display. The top line displays whose turn it is.
 The second line displays the turn number of the current player and the
 upcoming roll number. The bottom line shows the options available to the
 player. These options can be ROLL DICE, WRITE SCORE OR ROLL AGAIN, OR WRITE
 SCORE. The current players SCORESHEET is displayed on the right of the
 screen. At the bottom of the SCORESHEET is the current players name and
 their running total. This total is not updated until the end of the current
 game.

To Roll the Dice Click on the DIE in the upper left of the screen. The cup
 rattles and the 5 dice appear on the screen. To put a dice back in the cup
 for a reroll, click on one of 5 DICE. Click the SORT DICE button and the 5
 dice will display in numerical sequence from left to right, low to high. If
 you accidentally discard a dice you didn't mean to, click on the REPLACE
 DICE button.

After each roll, the outcome of the roll is displayed in the OPTIONS LIST.
 This list contains all the possible scores that you can write to your
 score sheet. For example it may list:
 THREES 9
 FULL HOUSE 25
 THREE OF A KIND 21.
 SIXES 12
 SCRATCH
    This indicates you rolled 3 Threes and 2 sixes and none of the above
 had already been taken. For example, if you had already written THREES to
 your scoresheet, it will not be listed. If you get a BONUS 100  
 ( extra yahtzee) and take it, you are not credited with taking a turn and
 thus get extra turns at the end of the game until you turn = 13.

II. THE RULES OF YAHTZEE.

The object of the game is to score as many points as possible in 13 turns.
 You get three rolls of the dice per turn. After the third roll of the dice,
 you must enter your score. Of course, you can enter it after any roll if
 you desire.  If you didn't roll a combination which you can write, then
 you must scratch a score. For this you get a zero. Sometimes it is
 advantageous to use a scratch instead of writing a score.

III. TIPS AND STRATEGY
 You need 63 points in the upper section to score a bonus of 35 points.
This can be accomplished by rolling 3 of each of the scores in this 
section. Try and get 4 of a kind and use it in the upper section first.
This will allow you more freedom to try for other things. For example if
if you roll 4 sixes and write 24 for you sixes score, you will only have
to get 2 threes, 2 twos and 2 ones.
 It is easier to get a large straight if you leave a 2345 showing and try
to get a 1 or a 6. You have a 1 in 3 chance. Trying to roll a 4 if you 
leave a 1235 is a 1 in 6 chance.
 If you have to scratch a score and already have 63 in the upper section,
scratch in the upper section. The hardest combinations to roll are 
Yahtzee, Large Straight and Four of a kind. Scratch these first if you
have to.
