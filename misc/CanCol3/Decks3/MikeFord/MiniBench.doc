MiniBench

    This program is most useful if have a hard drive. I heavily modified
a program which I download on PLINK.

    This program lets you run the programs of your choice without having
to open a bunch of drawers to find the icon.

The file deckbrowser must be present somewhere for this program to work.
Wherever you move it, be sure to change the default tool in the Workbench
info menu to reflect the change.

I.  The Mini Bench Window --
    Double Click on a program name which you have entered with the editor
and it will run. 
   a. The More Button - takes you to a another window described later.
   b. The Editor Button - takes you to the program editor where you can
        enter the programs you want to be displayed.
   c. Quit - guess what.

II. The Editor Window --
   a. New Program Button -- To enter a new program in your list, click 
        on the New Program Button and use the file selector to select
        the program you wish. If it is an executable program or a Can-DO
        deck, it can be used. (NOTE: For CanDo decks, Deckbrowser must 
        be in the C directory of the disk you boot from. 
        You can also add programs by typing in the directory in the field
        provided and the filename in the field provided. However, no check
        is made whether or not it is a valid program, only checks that it
        it a valid path.

   b. Add Button -- Once you have selected a program click Add and the
        program will be added to your list at the highlighted line
        in your list. Whatever was there before will be moved down.

   c. Delete - Deletes the highlighted line.
   d. Last Saved - reloads the list from the last saved.
   e. Save - Saves the list to your S: directory (pp.list)
   f. Up and Down - moves the highlighted name up or down in your list.
   g. ----- Button - puts a dotted line in your list for separation
        of groups of programs.
   h. Comment - Type in a comment in the space provided for a file name
        and you can insert a comment in your list. For example, you
        may want to group your programs according to type like Games,
        Utilities,Ect. This will let you put any text you wish in
        your list.
   i. Change Directory - lets you change the Current Directory of
        the program. For example, if you have NewCli in your list,
        you can have the current directory set to whatever you wish
        when you run it.
       To do this, first double click on a file in the list. The
        file and current directory will be moved to the fields.
        Next, click on Change directory and use the file requestor
        to locate a directory or type in the directory in the field.
        Don't worry about the file name(if any) in the File requestor.
         It isn't included.
        Then click the Replace Button.
   j. Replace - first you must double click on a name in your list.
        Then either change directories or alter the stack size or
        change the case lettering of your program name and click
        replace.
   k. Stack field - type in the stack size your program needs. Most
        only need 4000. Check the docs for your application.

The More Window --
   Format and Diskcopy must be in the System Drawer of your boot disk or
these wont work. NewCli must be in the C: directory.
   a. Diskcopy - select the source and destination disk by Clicking
        the Source and Dest buttons and then click Diskcopy.
   b. Format - select the disk you wish to format using the DEST button.
   C. Q - If highlighted, trys to do a quick format. Quick format only
        works on disk which have been previously formatted and you wish
        to initialize. Click format after you highlight Q.
   d. Reader - Takes you to an ASCII file reader. 
   e. Info - Time, Date, Memory. From this window, you can go to
       Disk info where Mounted Volumes are shown as well
       as Capacity, Free Disk Space, ect.

The Reader Window - Self explanatory - Hit the Esc key to Exit.
