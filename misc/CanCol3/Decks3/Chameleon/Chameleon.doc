     Chameleon, V 1.0, by M. Joel Guerra, January 31, 1990

     The Workbench Chameleon is a program designed to quickly
change between Workbench color sets.  A database file of color
sets, Chameleon.colors, is loaded after Chameleon is first
executed.  You must have either CanDo or the freely-distri-
butable DeckBrowser program to run Chameleon.

     Start Chameleon by double-clicking on its icon.  If you want
to use DeckBrowser to run the program, you'll need to change the
Default Tool to c:DeckBrowser (assuming you put DeckBrowser in
the c: directory).  To start Chameleon from a CLI or shell, go to
the directory where you put Chameleon and type:

     c:DeckRunner Chameleon        or
     c:DeckBrowser Chameleon       if you don't have CanDo

     If Chameleon doesn't find Chameleon.colors in the current
directory, it then looks in the s: directory.  A sample
Chameleon.colors is included; I recommend that you copy it to
your s: directory if that directory is on a hard disk.  Other-
wise, if you will always be double-clicking on the Workbench icon
to launch Chameleon, just copy Chameleon, Chameleon.info, and
Chameleon.colors to the same directory.  Even if Chameleon.colors
is not found the first time, you can always create a new file
with the Save option of the program, but this new file will
always be saved in the s: directory in this version.
     When executed, Chameleon presents you with a list of Color
Sets on the left, a set of Red/Green/Blue arrow buttons, four
color rectangles on the right, and a row of option buttons on the
bottom.
     To change to a new set of colors, just double-click on
the name of the desired set.
     You can adjust any one of the four Workbench pen colors at a
time.  First select a pen color by clicking on the desired color
rectangle on the right.  An "X" will mark the new spot.  Then
click on the arrow buttons below the Red/Green/Blue headings:  on
the left arrow to lower the color value, on the right arrow to
increase the value.  The values will vary from 0 to 255 in
increments of 17 (this is intended to support the future
extensions of the color register system by Commodore).
     After making your changes to the colors, you can save your
new color set by selecting Add.  Doing so will prompt for a name
for the set.  You can enter a name with up to 10 letters.  Click
on OK to enter the new set into the group.  (If there is already
a set by that name, it will be replaced.)  You are also given the
option to Cancel, if you wish.
     An alternative is to replace an existing color set with the
one you've just created or modified.  If the color set you want
to replace is not already highlighted, just single-click on the
set of your choice.  Then click on Replace.  You will be asked
for confirmation.
     If you wish to delete a color set, just single-click on the
color set you wish to remove, then click on Delete.  Again,
Chameleon will prompt you for confirmation that you really want
to delete the highlighted color set.
     If you wish to save the new group of color sets, click on
Save, followed by OK to confirm, or Cancel to avoid saving.

     Please Note:

     The "<Original>" entry is always recreated when Chameleon is
first started.  This entry contains the color set that was in
use when Chameleon was started.  This way, you can always return
to your original colors by double-clicking on "<Original>"
(unless you delete it or replace it).

     For you technical CanDoers:

     This deck demonstrates a method of implementing a requester
without going to a separate card.  The requester is a generic
one, relying on a variable called "ThisButton" to execute a
routine when OK is selected.  Clicking on the Add button, for
example, assigns the string "Add" to ThisButton.  While the
Cancel button on the requester just executes the routine called
MyReqDone, the OK button executes a routine determined by
concatenating the string "OK" with ThisButton's data.  In the Add
button example, the executed routine would be "OKAdd".
     To avoid going to a separate card, the requester is overlaid
on top of other buttons.  First, the ClipBrush command is used to
save the image to be overlaid.  Then certain buttons are moved
from off-window (where they were moved by the AfterStartUp
script) to the desired positions on the window with the
MoveObject command.  Note:  These buttons are the LAST ones in
the button list:  BlankButton, OKButton and CancelButton.
BlankButton is big enough to cover the entire window.  This
button "disables" the buttons and document object underneath it
when it is over them.  Only OKButton and CancelButton can be
"clicked" on, since they exist "above" the BlankButton.
     With the MoveObject command, the deck also demonstrates
pseudo-dynamic buttons and fields.  Instead of creating the
buttons and fields on the fly, they are created with everything
else at the beginning, then moved off-window until needed.
     Author's note:  This deck was done to demonstrate that you
did NOT need to go to a new card to have a requester in your
program.  However, it is far, far simpler just to have a
requester on a separate card.

My thanks to Ken Schaefer for the inspiration.  Enjoy the
program.  -- Joel, aka The Mad Hacker
