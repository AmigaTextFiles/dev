     DirBrowser 1.02, February 2, 1990, M. Joel Guerra

DirBrowser is the beginning of something potentially much, much
greater.  Right now, you can use it to examine the contents of
your various disk drives, assigns, and directories.  Double-click
on the icon to load it.  (CanDo.library/DeckRunner or DeckBrowser
is required; if you only have DeckBrowser, you'll need to change
the Default Tool from DeckRunner to DeckBrowser.

What you get looks like yet another file requester.  Well, it is,
but it's much more.  You can go from Drawers to Disks to Assigns
by clicking on the Drawers button.  Double-click on one of the
drawers/disks/assigns in the listing on the left side of the
window to select that drawer/disk/assign.  The right listing is
of files only.  All files ending in ".info" are excluded.
Clicking on File Type will tell you the type of the highlighted
file: Program, Deck, Brush, Picture, Sound, etc.

Now, if you double-click on a file shown in the file listing, or
enter the complete file specification (path and file) in the text
field box near the top of the window, DirBrowser will act on that
file.

If the file is a program, it will be executed.  If it's a deck,
it will be run via DeckRunner (you'll need CanDo for this one).
If it is an 8SVX sound, or IFF picture, or brush, or brush
animation (BrushAnim) it will be played or shown.  Brush
animations will be "running"; you can change the animation speed
by clicking in the display window.  You can exit from a picture
display by clicking in the upper left corner, by using the menu
exit, or by Right-Amiga-Q.

If the file type is "Unknown", DirBrowser will attempt to display
it as text in a window with horizontal and vertical scroll bars.
(One current limitation:  if the file has ANSI escape sequences,
the file lister will only list up to the first escape character.)

Now, if you have CanDo, you can change DirBrowser to suit
yourself.  For example, you can a print capability for both
pictures and text; just add a menu item to the appropriate card.
For the text, have the Selected script contain the line:

     SaveDocument DocumentName,"PRT:"

For the picture, use a Dos command:

     Dos "Run <Nil: >Nil: Workbench:Utilities/GraphicDump"

which assumes you have that volume mounted.

A little more work can get you a simple text editor, or picture
or brush cut-and-paste tools.  Then you can save your work with
the various Save commands of CanDo:  SaveDocument, SavePicture,
SaveBrush.  Or you can build your own "Directory Utility", to
copy, delete, or rename files.

I'm sure many folks will be modifying this one or creating their
own versions, which they will then make available to you.

Enjoy.  -- Joel
