          DocSorter v1.0 - M. Joel Guerra

    This simple deck demonstrates the use of CanDo's SortDocument
command.  You can sort text files starting at any column from 1
to 80, in ascending or descending order, case-sensitive or not
case-sensitive.  Use the Find File button to find the file to
sort, or enter its name in the Source File: field.

    You can change the Destination entry to direct output to the
PRT:  device or any other valid output device (for example,
"CON:0/0/640/100/MySortedFile", if you really want to do
something interesting and useless).  A good destination would be
something like "RAM:Temp" if the file to sort is small enough.

    Enter a starting column (if different than 1) by clicking on
the number and editing it.  Clicking on Ascending will change it
to Descending and vice versa.  The same applies to the Yes/No for
Case Sensitivity.

    When ready to sort, just select the Sort File button or the
appropriate menu item or even the short-cut key, Right-Amiga-S.
The status field will keep you informed as to the progress of the
sort.

    To quit, select the Close button (gadget) in the upper left
of the window, or the Quit menu item, or press Right-Amiga-Q.

     ============== For those with CanDo ==================

    For those of you who have CanDo, this deck also demonstrates
the DoOnError command.  When encountered in a script, this
command tells CanDo (or cando.library) that error handling will
be done by the routine referenced by the DoOnError.  This is a
very useful command, for it can prevent your application from
exiting mysteriously back to Workbench without telling the user
that an error occurred.

    You will also find another example of the AskForFileName
function, and see a couple of ways to handle what it returns.  If
you are using CanDo v1.0 or v1.01 in browse mode, you will be
told that SetAutoFileRequester is a privileged command.  Just
select OK to ignore the error.  SetAutoFileRequester is no longer
privileged as of CanDo version 1.02.  Actually, the only reason
SetAutoFileRequester is even used is to get around the FileType
bug that causes the file requester to pop up (saying "Wrong File
Type") when only a directory is specified.  (This, too, is fixed
as of v1.02.)

    Feel free to adapt any of the routines to your own purposes,
but don't use the program as an example of good programming.
It's a hack, and there are a few sections of code which could be
optimized.
