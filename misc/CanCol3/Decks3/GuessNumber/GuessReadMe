Hello,

  Here is a sample CanDo deck demonstrating how to wait for input from a
Field.  The trick is have a script occur on a Field's RETURN event.  When
input comes from that field, the script will then do something with it, in
this case determine whether the number guessed is correct.  Feel free to
study the code from within CanDo.
  This deck contains one Card, one Document Object, one Field, and one Button.
This is about as simple an example of input as you can get, and still be
interesting.
  To run this deck, use DeckBrowser, or if you own CanDo, use DeckRunner.
