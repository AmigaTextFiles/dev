Well you know Tetris already so here is some stuff on this implementation.
To run this Deck you need CanDo or the DeckBrowser, version 1.02.  To edit
the Deck, you'll need CanDo 1.02 with the KeyInput Object XtraTool in the
XtraTools directory.  The XtraTool can be found on the INOVAtronics board
at 214-357-8511, or maybe even on the system from which you got this!

Anyway, this is how to play CanTrix:

Run it.  To control it, use:

Keys:
	Right             RIGHT ARROW
	Left              LEFT ARROW
	Rotate Right      SHIFT-RIGHT ARROW or DOWN ARROW
	Rotate Left       SHIFT-LEFT ARROW
	Drop Piece        UP ARROW or SPACEBAR
	
	New Game          RIGHT AMIGA-N
	End Game          RIGHT AMIGA-E
	Pause Game        RIGHT AMIGA-P
	Quit              RIGHT AMIGA-Q

The resource directory has to be in the same directory that the
Cantrix deck is in.  Sorry, but there are very few comments in this
deck.  It is for the most part very clear what is going on, just
print out the deck.
