Welcome to CanDo Tutorials Volume 1 from Rush Software
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Only a few brief notes to mention.

1. The drawers on this disk match the chapters of the CanDo Tutorials Book.
   Where the tutorials are spread over 2 chapters only one deck exists.

2. If you have a hard drive create a drawer called "CanDo Tutorials" and
   drag the appropriate drawers from the floppy disk to the Hard drive.

3. It is assumed that you own a copy of CanDo and hence the Cando.Library,
   but just in case you have a version prior to Version 2.0 the library
   is included on the Tutorial disk to allow you to run the decks.

4. The KidsPaint drawer includes the the entire unbound deck and subdeck
   of the popular childrens paint program. This should reveal many advanced
   programming techniques and time saving tricks.

   The program may not be resold for profit but you are welcome to use some
   routines in your own code so long as Rush Software receives a copy and
   an acknowledgement is made in your program.
