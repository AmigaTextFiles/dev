After a long night, the lazy coder wakes up for a new usefull tool ...

                               ============
                               HunkAnalyzer
                               ============

... is designed to analyze the format of an executable, display info about it,
and save a stripped out version if possible. It is ment to be used by coders
who work with DEVPAC-like compilers and want to have raw 68000 code to include
in trackloads, for instance.

Copyright notice : this program is NOT public domain, that means : if you use it
                   without sending me some money (US $5 should be enough), you
                   will burn in hell forever.
                   On the other hand, if you give me lots of money, you will
                   receive any further developement without having to request
                   it.
