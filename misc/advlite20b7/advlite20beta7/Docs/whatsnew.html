   The linking ability is the new powerfull feature in AutodocViewer Lite v2.0, but the major
   backdraft with this feature, is that it is very CPU demaning, a possible new addon is
   that the user can disable this feature, but that are very insure yet!!! Since, I'v not
   tried to optimize it.<P>

   Any new improvments that you what see in any future releases of ADV are welcome. Just send
   a mail to <A HREF="mailto:autodocviewer@c2i.net">autodocviewer.</A><P>
