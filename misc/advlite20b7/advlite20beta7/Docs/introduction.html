   The reason I began developing AutodocViewer way back in the early nintys, was that
   I was tired of paging the Amiga ROM Kernel and I failed to find any
   application (at that time) to browse throughout the autodoc files in a smooth manner.<P>

   The first version of AutodocViewer was made back in 1994, but I was not
   entirely satisfied with the concept and in 1995 I completely rewrote the source.
   The program has turned out to be most powerfull, and as far as I knew
   no major bugs. Early in 1996 some bugs where removed.<P>

   Version 1.0 were first released in October 1998, and the feedback has been
   enormous. Since then, about ten updates of v1.x has been release, but the application
   have not seen any major new features.<P>

   AutodocViewer v1.0 was coded in pure assembly. The final source code added up to
   230.258 bytes and the assembled executable was 30.124 bytes.<P>

   The list of wanted features and suggestions has only grown bigger and bigger,
   and I realized that I had to do something real drastic. So, I got down an planned
   for the v2.0 release for about 8 months ago. Luckly, I have been very busy
   with other things lately, like getting married, bought my own house etc :-)<P>

   Anyway, here are the result of many hours of sweet and teardrops.<P>
