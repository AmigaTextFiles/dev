   AutodocViewer Lite v2.0 requires atleast AmigaOS v3.5 and MC68020 CPU to start. The memory requirements and free disk space
   depends on how AutodocViewer Lite is customized.<P>

   AutodocViewer also requires autodocs formatted with Autodoc Style Guide by Commodore Electronics Ltd. and it's
   recommended that the user also use assembly includes or c includes. The AmigaOS 3.5 autodocs and includes are
   found on AmigaDeveloper CD v2.1, other developer archives like MUI, RTG etc. are found on Aminet.<P>

   It's recommended that the users computer has atleast an 68040/40 CPU, 4Mb of free memory and about 2Mb of
   free disk space (includes and Autodocs are not included in the recommended free disk space).<P><BR>
