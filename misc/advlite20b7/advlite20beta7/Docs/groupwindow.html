   <STRONG>The Group Window</STRONG>
  </FONT>
  <P>

  The Group Window display an list of groups that the user has configurated. The user can also specify
  in which order the group(s) created are to be shown in the list. The user can select between automatically
  alphabetize or edit to order by hand. By default the alphabetize option are swicthed off.<P>

  Group names are not case sensetive and the user are not allowed to create groups with the same name. However,
  the user can create unlimited number of groups, or until AutodocViewerLite run out of memory.<P>

  A group are used to configurate autodocs into different groups (figures). This makes in possible to create
  groups for different projects and sort the autodocs into groups like libraries, devices, handlers etc. I
  would recommend that a complete group list should look something like this, in alpbabetical order.<BR>

  <UL>
   <LI>Datatypes</LI>
   <LI>Devices</LI>
   <LI>Gadgets</LI>
   <LI>Handlers</LI>
   <LI>Images</LI>
   <LI>Linker Libraries</LI>
   <LI>Libraries</LI>
   <LI>Math</LI>
   <LI>MUI</LI>
   <LI>Resources</LI>
   <LI>PPC</LI>
  </UL>

  The maximum length of the group name are set to 31 characters, I belive that is more than sufficient.<P>
