  <P>

  The chronicle window display the last steps that user has taken. The number of steps to remember are set to
  25 as default, but the user may change it to what ever he/she wants. This can be done in the menustrip.<P>
  This window will only open if the user select it from the menustrip, be it will remain open until the user
  closes it, even if the AutodocViewer Lite are restarted.<P>
  While selecting one of the chronicles in the list, AutodocViewer Lite will jump to that previous step.<P>
