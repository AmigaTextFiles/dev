@{b}The ARexx Interface Designer@{ub}

Beginning with V2.0, EasyRexx offers an  intuitive method of designing your
ARexx interface (also called the  'Designer'  in this documentation).  With
this utility you can design the  entire  interface  in a very intuitive way
without any programming at all.

@node description "Description"

@{b}Description@{ub}
easyrexx.library is a very fast shared  run-time library that lets applica-
tion developers add an AREXX port to their application with no fuss at all.
Interpreting EasyRexx  AREXX  messages  will  now  be  as  easy  as reading
arguments from a DOS prompt! A whole  new  world  will  open  up,  just  by
calling a few functions in this library!

Beginning with version 2.0  the  EasyRexx  package  also  features an AREXX
Interface Designer.  A GUI-based  program  which  allows  you to define the
entire AREXX interface and  generate  source  codes  which  are ready to be
compiled.

Beginning  with  version  3.0  easyrexx.library  also  features  a  set  of
functions which makes it easy to add recordable macros to an application.

Most functions are tagbased which  makes  them  very  easy to use and fully
extendable.  The example  source  is  pretty  much  self-explanatory so you
should take a look it and see how easy it is to use the library.

All functions in  the  library  are  thoroughly  described  in the EasyRexx
autodoc.

@node GUI "Describing the graphic user interface"

Much work has been done to  make  the  graphic user interface intuitive and
easy to use.  Here are some of its features:

@{b}o@{ub} Multi-window  environment.   The  windows work inde-
pendently of each other and are 'multitasking'.
@{b}o@{ub} All windows are font-adaptable and sizeable.
@{b}o@{ub} The program  can  either  display its windows on the
Workbench, on the default  public  screen  or  open  an  own  screen of any
resolution, size and depth.
@{b}o@{ub}  Most  gadgets  have  keyboard  equivalents for easy
execution.
@{b}o@{ub}  The  windows  will  remember  it's  attributes when
closed and reopened.
@{b}o@{ub} All environment attributes may be saved to disk.
@{b}o@{ub} On-line  help  for  all  windows,  gadgets and menu-
items.
@{b}o@{ub} Image buttons where appropriate.
@{b}o@{ub} EasyRexx comes  with  several  nice fonts which look
good on both non-interlaced and interlaced screens.

@{b}Listview control@{ub}
Listviews may be controlled using the arrow-keys
Cursor up/down - previous/next item
Shift Cursor up/down - previous/next page
Control Cursor up/down - top/bottom item
Alt Cursor up/down - top/bottom item
or pressing the vanilla key that  is  underlined in the border group title.
Pressing the vanilla key will jump to the next item.  The previous item may
be selected by holding down  any  shift  button  and then press the vanilla
key.

@{b}NOTE@{ub}
A gadget-shortcut may be  cancelled  by  pressing  another  key or the alt-
qualifier while holding the shortcut-key down.

@{b}Screen notification support@{ub}
Whenever screennotify.library is  available  in  libs  the  ARexx Interface
Designer will make use of this library.   This means that the Designer will
automatically close and reopen its windows  whenever the visiting screen is
closed or its pubscreen attributes changes.

**************************************************************************
@node Help "Using on-line help"

ARexx Interface Designer has a built-in help  function that can pop up help
on any  window,  gadget  or  menu-item  directly  from  the  program.  This
function is activated when  positioning  the  mouse-pointer  over a window,
gadget, gadget-title or menu-item and  then  pressing  the HELP-key on your
keyboard.  Help may also  be  retrieved  by  hitting  the  HELP key while a
string is active.

Help and information is also  available  through  the rightmost menu, Help.
Selecting one of  the  menu  items  in  that  menu  will  display  help and
information on the selected topic.

AmigaGuide is opened asynchronously, meaning  that  it  will be launched as
separate task,  independently  from  the  ARexx  Interface  Designer.  This
allows you to continue your work while help is being displayed.

If you wish to select  help  on  another  subject while AmigaGuide is open,
just activate the desirable window,  place  the  pointer at another object,
press HELP and AmigaGuide will show text on that subject without you having
to close its window and load everything again.

The latest versions of AmigaGuide  allows  you  to save position, width and
height of the AmigaGuide-window.  When the on-line help system is activated
later, AmigaGuide will open at the coordinates last saved.  You should only
save the AmigaGuide settings if the  ARexx  Interface Designer is opened on
its own screen or else the settings  will  affect all the other programs as
well.

The documentation was  designed  to  look  good  under  all resolutions and
fonts, and the text will  wordwrap  in  order  to  fit  all text within the
window frames.  Allthough the documentation font will default to AmigaGuide
11 you may easily change the font by editing  the 6th line in the docs in a
standard texteditor.

On systems using OS38 or  lower  special  formatted  docs will be installed
instead of the standard docs which are using special attributes for layout.
The docs used under OS38 or lower are formatted for a 640 pixel wide screen
and will not wordwrap or use  special  AmigaGuide  font.  The OS38 or lower
docs can be found in the  'Docs/Pre  WB3.0'  drawer and they will automati-
cally be installed on such systems by the installer script.

@{b}NOTE@{ub}
In order for the on-line help  system to work, 'amigaguide.library' must be
available on your system.

************************************************************************
@node switches "Setting argument switches"

This chapter will describe  the  different  switches  that  are allowed for
arguments.

The rightmost corner of the argument  group  contains a column of checkbut-
tons which may be checked independently for each argument.  These checkbut-
tons is important for how the arguments will be interpreted.

The default argument type (no switches are checked) is a string (a sequence
whitespace characters, or delimited by quotes,  which will be stripped), in
which case the entry will be a pointer.

Options can be followed by modifiers, which specify things such as the type
of the option.  Modifiers are specified  by  following  the option with a /
and a single character modifier.   Multiple  modifiers  can be specified by
using multiple Switch's.  Valid modifiers are:

@{" Always " link always}
@{" Keyword " link keyword}
@{" Number " link number}
@{" Switch " link switch}
@{" Toggle " link toggle}
@{" Multiple " link multiple}
@{" Final " link final}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node always "Always"

Setting this switch means that this  argument  must be given a value during
command-line processing, or an error will be returned.

There is an interaction between  @{"Multiple" link multiple} parameters and
Always parameters. If there are  unfilled  Always parameters after parsing,
it will grab strings from the end of a previous @{"Multiple" link multiple}
parameter list to  fill  the  /As.   This  is  used  for  things  like Copy
("From/A/M,To/A").


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node keyword "Keyword"

Set this switch if a keyword  is  required  in  front of the argument.  For
example if the template is  "Name/K",  then unless "Name=<string>" or "Name
<string>" appears in the command line, Name will not be filled.


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node number "Number"

Setting this switch is considered a  decimal  number.  If an invalid number
is specified, an error will be  returned.   The  entry will be a pointer to
the longword number (this is how you know if a number was specified).


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node switch "Switch"

Set this switch and the argument will be considered a boolean variable, and
will be set if the option name  appears  in the command-line.  The entry is
the boolean (0 for not set, non-zero for set).


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node toggle "Toggle"


This is similar to @{"Switch" link  switch},  but when specified causes the
boolean value to "toggle".


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node multiple "Multiple"

Setting this switch means the  argument  will  take  any number of strings,
returning them as an array of strings.   Any arguments not considered to be
part of another option will  be  added  to  this option.  Only one Multiple
should be specified in a  template.   Example  for a template "Dir/M,All/S"
the command-line "foo bar all qwe"  will  set the boolean "all", and return
an array consisting of "foo",  "bar",  and  "qwe".   The entry in the array
will be a pointer to an array of string pointers, the last of which will be
NULL.

There is an interaction  between  Multiple  parameters  and @{"Always" link
always} parameters. If there  are  unfilled  @{"Always" link always} param-
eters after parsing, it  will  grab  strings  from  the  end  of a previous
Multiple parameter list to fill the /As.  This is used for things like Copy
("From/A/M,To/A").


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node final "Final"

If this is specified for an argument, the  entire rest of the line is taken
as the parameter for the option,  even  if other option  keywords appear in
it.

@node macrowindow "Macro settings"

Beginning with V3.0,  EasyRexx  features  a  set  of  functions  to create,
record, run, read and write  ARexx  macros.  ARexx Interface Designer takes
full advantage of these new functions  and offers advanced macro control of
the designer utility.

The macro window and menu allow the  user  to  set up a default of 10 ARexx
macros.  The macros themselves may be entered directly into the macrostring
or selected from a file requester.   When  entered,  the macro name will be
displayed in the ARexx menu.

An ARexx macro can be run by selecting  the macro name in the ARexx menu or
by selecting one of the numbered gadgets in the macro window.
