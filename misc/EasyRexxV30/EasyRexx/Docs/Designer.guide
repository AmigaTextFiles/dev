@node description "Description"

@{fg shine}Description@{fg text}
easyrexx.library is a very fast shared run-time library that lets application developers add an AREXX port to their application with no fuss at all.  Interpreting EasyRexx AREXX messages will now be as easy as reading arguments from a DOS prompt!	A whole new world will open up, just by calling a few functions in this library!  

Beginning with version 2.0 the EasyRexx package also features an AREXX Interface Designer.  A GUI-based program which allows you to define the entire AREXX interface and generate source codes which are ready to be compiled.

Beginning with version 3.0 easyrexx.library also features a set of functions which makes it easy to add recordable macros to an application.

Most functions are tagbased which makes them very easy to use and fully extendable.  The example source is pretty much self-explanatory so you should take a look it and see how easy it is to use the library.

All functions in the library are thoroughly described in the EasyRexx autodoc.

@node GUI "Describing the graphic user interface"

Much work has been done to make the graphic user interface intuitive and easy to use.  Here are some of its features:

@{fg shine}o@{fg text} Multi-window environment.  The windows work independently of each other and are 'multitasking'.
@{fg shine}o@{fg text} All windows are font-adaptable and sizeable.
@{fg shine}o@{fg text} The program can either display its windows on the Workbench, on the default public screen or open an own screen of any resolution, size and depth.
@{fg shine}o@{fg text} Most gadgets have keyboard equivalents for easy execution.
@{fg shine}o@{fg text} The windows will remember it's attributes when closed and reopened.
@{fg shine}o@{fg text} All environment attributes may be saved to disk.
@{fg shine}o@{fg text} On-line help for all windows, gadgets and menu-items.
@{fg shine}o@{fg text} Image buttons where appropriate.
@{fg shine}o@{fg text} EasyRexx comes with several nice fonts which look good on both non-interlaced and interlaced screens.

@{fg shine}Listview control@{fg text}
Listviews may be controlled using the arrow-keys
Cursor up/down - previous/next item
Shift Cursor up/down - previous/next page
Control Cursor up/down - top/bottom item
Alt Cursor up/down - top/bottom item
or pressing the vanilla key that is underlined in the border group title.  Pressing the vanilla key will jump to the next item.  The previous item may be selected by holding down any shift button and then press the vanilla key.

@{fg shine}NOTE@{fg text}
A gadget-shortcut may be cancelled by pressing another key or the alt-qualifier while holding the shortcut-key down.

@{fg shine}Screen notification support@{fg text}
Whenever screennotify.library is available in libs the ARexx Interface Designer will make use of this library.  This means that the Designer will automatically close and reopen its windows whenever the visiting screen is closed or its pubscreen attributes changes.

**************************************************************************
@node Help "Using on-line help"
	
ARexx Interface Designer has a built-in help function that can pop up help on any window, gadget or menu-item directly from the program.  This function is activated when positioning the mouse-pointer over a window, gadget, gadget-title or menu-item and then pressing the HELP-key on your keyboard.  Help may also be retrieved by hitting the HELP key while a string is active.

Help and information is also available through the rightmost menu, Help.  Selecting one of the menu items in that menu will display help and information on the selected topic.

AmigaGuide is opened asynchronously, meaning that it will be launched as separate task, independently from the ARexx Interface Designer.  This allows you to continue your work while help is being displayed.
	
If you wish to select help on another subject while AmigaGuide is open, just activate the desirable window, place the pointer at another object, press HELP and AmigaGuide will show text on that subject without you having to close its window and load everything again.

The latest versions of AmigaGuide allows you to save position, width and height of the AmigaGuide-window.  When the on-line help system is activated later, AmigaGuide will open at the coordinates last saved.  You should only save the AmigaGuide settings if the ARexx Interface Designer is opened on its own screen or else the settings will affect all the other programs as well.

The documentation was designed to look good under all resolutions and fonts, and the text will wordwrap in order to fit all text within the window frames.  Allthough the documentation font will default to AmigaGuide 11 you may easily change the font by editing the 6th line in the docs in a standard texteditor.

On systems using OS38 or lower special formatted docs will be installed instead of the standard docs which are using special attributes for layout.  The docs used under OS38 or lower are formatted for a 640 pixel wide screen and will not wordwrap or use special AmigaGuide font.  The OS38 or lower docs can be found in the 'Docs/Pre WB3.0' drawer and they will automatically be installed on such systems by the installer script.

@{fg shine}NOTE@{fg text}
In order for the on-line help system to work, 'amigaguide.library' must be available on your system.

************************************************************************
@node switches "Setting argument switches"

This chapter will describe the different switches that are allowed for arguments.

The rightmost corner of the argument group contains a column of checkbuttons which may be checked independently for each argument.  These checkbuttons is important for how the arguments will be interpreted.

The default argument type (no switches are checked) is a string (a sequence whitespace characters, or delimited by quotes, which will be stripped), in which case the entry will be a pointer.

Options can be followed by modifiers, which specify things such as the type of the option.  Modifiers are specified by following the option with a / and a single character modifier.  Multiple modifiers can be specified by using multiple Switch's.  Valid modifiers are:

@{" Always " link always}
@{" Keyword " link keyword}
@{" Number " link number}
@{" Switch " link switch}
@{" Toggle " link toggle}
@{" Multiple " link multiple}
@{" Final " link final}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node always "Always"

Setting this switch means that this argument must be given a value during command-line processing, or an error will be returned.

There is an interaction between @{"Multiple" link multiple} parameters and Always parameters. If there are unfilled Always parameters after parsing, it will grab strings from the end of a previous @{"Multiple" link multiple} parameter list to fill the /As.  This is used for things like Copy ("From/A/M,To/A").


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node keyword "Keyword"

Set this switch if a keyword is required in front of the argument.  For example if the template is "Name/K", then unless "Name=<string>" or "Name <string>" appears in the command line, Name will not be filled.


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node number "Number"

Setting this switch is considered a decimal number.  If an invalid number is specified, an error will be returned.  The entry will be a pointer to the longword number (this is how you know if a number was specified).


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node switch "Switch"

Set this switch and the argument will be considered a boolean variable, and will be set if the option name appears in the command-line.  The entry is the boolean (0 for not set, non-zero for set).


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node toggle "Toggle"

This is similar to @{"Switch" link switch}, but when specified causes the boolean value to "toggle".


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node multiple "Multiple"

Setting this switch means the argument will take any number of strings, returning them as an array of strings.  Any arguments not considered to be part of another option will be added to this option.  Only one Multiple should be specified in a template.  Example for a template "Dir/M,All/S" the command-line "foo bar all qwe" will set the boolean "all", and return an array consisting of "foo", "bar", and "qwe".  The entry in the array will be a pointer to an array of string pointers, the last of which will be NULL.

There is an interaction between Multiple parameters and @{"Always" link always} parameters. If there are unfilled @{"Always" link always} parameters after parsing, it will grab strings from the end of a previous Multiple parameter list to fill the /As.  This is used for things like Copy ("From/A/M,To/A").


See also @{" General about switches " link switches}
@endnode

************************************************************************
@node final "Final"

If this is specified for an argument, the entire rest of the line is taken as the parameter for the option, even if other option  keywords appear in it.

@node macrowindow "Macro settings"

Beginning with V3.0, EasyRexx features a set of functions to create, record, run, read and write ARexx macros.  ARexx Interface Designer takes full advantage of these new functions and offers advanced macro control of the designer utility.

The macro window and menu allow the user to set up a default of 10 ARexx macros.  The macros themselves may be entered directly into the macrostring or selected from a file requester.  When entered, the macro name will be displayed in the ARexx menu.

An ARexx macro can be run by selecting the macro name in the ARexx menu or by selecting one of the numbered gadgets in the macro window.
