Here's an AVL tree library, written in C.  Someone asked about it on
comp.sources.wanted; I'll send him a copy too, but I think it's of
general utility, so I'd like to see it in comp.sources.unix.  It's known
to run on my Symmetric, and on a Macintosh (!) with the DeSmet C Compiler.

I extracted it from a PD assembler I was writing a year or so back, so
it makes some references to "as" in some comments... Please ignore these...
