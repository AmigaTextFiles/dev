Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program lets you view the contents of the memory in your computer. It
can be useful for programmers while debugging (that's what I wrote it for).
The program views 256 bytes at a time both in HEX and ASCII, and can update
its display automatically every 1/50 second.

Requirements/Usage:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The program requires v37 (2.0) of the operating system. The program can be
started from Workbench & CLI. No arguments are passed to the program while
starting it up. When the program open its window, it defaults to look at
address $40000 (this address should exist on all Amigas, except A1000).

There are 5 gadgets that controls the program. The address gadget is at the
left of the window. Here you should type in the address to look at. The
program doesn't check if the address is valid, and if you try to go inside
the custom chips, weird things will happen. Press the "Update Display"
gadget to refresh the display and change the current address.

The "Auto Update" gadget enables/disables automatic update of the display
every 1/50s.

The "Next 256 bytes" gadget changes the current address to 256 bytes later
in memory. Be careful to not enter the custom chip area ($DFF000)!

The "Prev 256 bytes" gadget changes the current address to 256 bytes earlier
in memory. Be careful to not enter the custom chip area ($DFF000)!

The program can be iconified by pressing the "Zoom" system gadget (it's the
first of the two gadgets in the right edge of the window title).

 If you want to have the source code for this program, and  maybe  use  it
 in  your  own programs, send me some equivalent assembly language program
 that YOU have written (about 680 lines of source, 2.6k exe).
