Development and Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Development and Testing
-----------------------

TimeKeep-Dev was developed on an Amiga 3000T/25MHz with 2 Meg CHIP / 16
Meg FAST memory.

TimeKeep-Dev has been tested under:
   Kickstart version 40.68, Workbench version 40.42
   Kickstart version 37.175, Workbench version 38.12


============================================================================
Installing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing
----------

The following files should be contained in the same directory:

                            TimeKeep-Dev
                            TimeKeep-Dev.info


Sample Data files
-----------------

The files contained in the "sample data" directory have been provided as
examples of the output created by TimeKeep-Dev.  To test them, copy them
into your S: directory and run TimeKeep-Dev.  These data files will also
allow you to see how the registered version remembers the contents of the
SoFar gadget to display the total hours:minutes spent on projects.
============================================================================
Starting
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting
--------

From Workbench, double-click on the TimeKeep-Dev icon.
============================================================================
Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration
-------------

TimeKeep-Dev supports configuration through use of Workbench ToolTypes.
If any options are not included as a ToolType, the stated defaults will
be used.

ToolTypes can be typed in upper or lower case or any combination of the
two.  To have a ToolType ignored surround it with brackets ( ).

For example:
                            (ToolType=Value)


Invalid settings and ToolTypes will be ignored.  In this case, the default
values will be used.

The following configuration commands are supported:

  BackFillColor=
    Description: Sets the palette color to use when filling the
                 background.  A value of -1 will disable the fill.
                 Colors are numbered from 0 up.

                 For MagicWB users, a value of 4 is recommended.

                 TimeKeep-Dev's NewScreen is currently a 4 color screen,
                 taking its palette from the Workbench.

    Valid values: -1, 0...(nColors-1)

    Default: -1

    Example: BackFillColor=4


  Database=
    Description: This is the FULL PATH and FILENAME of the data file
                 created by TimeKeep-Dev.  This file is where
                 TimeKeep-Dev stores Project and Module information.

    Default: "S:TimeKeep-Dev.data"

    Example: Database="DATA:ScotwareSoftware/.TimeKeep-Dev.data"


  DataPath=
    Description: This is the FULL PATH to where TimeKeep-Dev will create
                 its .time files.  These files contain TimeIn and TimeOut
                 information for generating invoices.

    Default: "S:TimeKeep-Dev"

    Example: DataPath="DATA:ScotwareSoftware/.TimeKeep-Dev"


  DefaultModule=

    Description: This is the text to be used as the name of the default
                 Module.  When a new Project is added, a default Module
                 is automatically created.

    Default: "General"

    Example: DefaultModule="Miscellaneous"


  Font=
    Description: This is the name of an 8 point font to be used within
                 TimeKeep-Dev.  Currently, only 8 point Proportional or
                 Non-Proportional fonts are supported.

                 TimeKeep-Dev will use the Default System Font,
                 regardless of size, for the window title bar, if opened
                 on the Default Public Screen.  If you use a really large
                 Default System Font, you may have problems with the
                 error message display.  If this is a problem for you,
                 try using the NewScreen option, and the Font option to
                 set a smaller font.

    Valid values: Any 8 point, Proportional or Non-Proportional font.

    Default: "topaz.font"

    Example: Font="Topaz2p"


  NewScreen=
    Description: If set to YES, TimeKeep-Dev will open on its own Public
                 Screen.

                 If set to NO, TimeKeep-Dev will open on the default
                 Public Screen.

    Valid values: YES, NO

    Default: NO

    Example: NewScreen=YES

============================================================================
Tutorial
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tutorial
--------

This tutorial will single-step you through the normal operation of
TimeKeep-Dev.

The assumption is made that you have not changed any of the defaults
through use of ToolTypes.


ADDING A NEW PROJECT
====================

 Start TimeKeep-Dev by Double-Clicking on its icon.

When you use TimeKeep-Dev for the very first time, the only gadget that
will be selectable is the ADD gadget, under the Project list requester.
If data had already been entered into TimeKeep-Dev, that data would now
be displayed.

 Left-click on the ADD gadget under the Project list requester.

The Project Name string gadget is auto-selected.

 Type 'Test Number 1' {ENTER}

If you wish to abort ADDing, at any time click on the DELETE gadget.

'Test Number 1' will now be added to the Project List and the default
Module 'General' will be added to the Module List.


ADDING A NEW MODULE
===================

 Left-Click on the ADD gadget, under the Module List.

The Module Name string gadget is auto-selected.

 Type 'Module 2' {ENTER}

If you wish to abort ADDing, at any time click on the DELETE gadget.

'Module 2' will now be added to the Module List.


KEEPING TRACK OF TIME
=====================

When you are ready to start/continue work on a Module, all you have to
do is select the Module (or add a new Module) and TimeIn.

 Left-Click on the Time In gadget

The current time will appear in the Time In string gadget.  If the Date
and Time are satisfactory, you may continue.  If you wish to make changes
you may do so by selecting the Date or Time string gadget and making
changes followed by {ENTER}.


TIMING-OUT OF A MODULE IN PROGRESS
==================================

When you have already started a Module using Time In, that Module will be
remembered the next time you start TimeKeep-Dev, and will be
automatically selected.

If we were Exiting and Re-starting TimeKeep-Dev, the 'Module 2' Module
would be automatically selected since it now has a TimeIn.

 Left-Click on the Time Out gadget

The current time will appear in the Time Out string gadget.  If the Time
is satisfactory, you may continue.  If you wish to make changes you may
do so by selecting the Time Out string gadget and make changes followed
by {ENTER}.

TimeKeep-Dev does not allow time to be carried on over 24 hours.  For
this reason, changing the information in the Date string will change the
Date for both Time In and Time Out.


QUITTING
========

If you wish to save any changes you have made, you should click on SAVE
or SAVE & QUIT.

 Left-Click on the QUIT gadget.

.time File Format
-----------------

This is the format of the .time data file created by TimeKeep-Dev.

LINE 1:
                             "<ProjectName>"

  example:
                            "This is Test #1"


LINE 2...n:

   "T","<Module>","<DateIn>","<TimeIn>","<TimeOut>",<Hours>,<Minutes>

  where:

  "T" = Time Information

     <Module>  = Module name
     <DateIn>  = Time In date
     <TimeIn>  = Time In time
     <TimeOut> = Time Out time
     <Hours>   = TimeOut - TimeIn (hours)
     <Minutes> = TimeOut - TimeIn (minutess)

  examples:

      "T","Test Module","May 16, 1995","12:15 PM","1:00 PM", 0, 45
