AmigaOS 68K version: be sure to set the stack size high enough before running the program,
by issuing the CLI command:
   
   stack 100000

before running the program.

All versions: unpack the archive into the AmigaOS NDK 3.9 AutoDocs directory and type

   adcvt listfile

If you're using the program for other AutoDoc-generated documentation, create a "listfile" 
that contains all files to be loaded by the program.

Make sure your computer has enough memory to run the program. It will output an error 
message if there is insufficient memory (same for stack size on AmigaOS).
