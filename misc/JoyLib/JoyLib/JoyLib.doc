    Hello World! This is a new joystick routine with a special algorhythm
    I'd call "Advanced Hufmann Word Shift Comparision" (just kidding).

    There are two versions of the routines: 1) standard ".o" linkage for
    any language able to call "_joy0/1" and compatible to BLINK format,
    2) a shared library (thanks to BLINK) for such nifty things like Modula
    and all... A .fd for building interfaces to *any* languae is provided.

    The routines will return a single argument in D0, which bits represent
    jyostick directions:

	     UP = 4

       LEFT = 1    RIGHT = 2

	    DOWN = 8

    FIRE = 16

    Simple enough, isn't it?

    This stuff is Public Domain; use it, inflame it, molest it...
