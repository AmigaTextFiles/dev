@node intro "catool - Introduction"
catool is a programme to manage the creation and maintenance of localized
programmes and catalog-files.
If you ever wrote your own localized programme you will find it quite useful.
It is something like a GUI-front-end for CatComp.
As you may have noticed: it is thaught for programmers and translators only :-)

This is the a beta release, so there is room for developing.
@endnode


@node required "catool - System requirements"
You need at least Kickstart V39 or higher to be able to run catool.
This is necessary for lots of reasons.
OS2.04 will not and cannot be supported.

Furthermore you need "CatComp" which is available as public domain.
@endnode


@node install "catool - Installation"
To install catool you only have to copy the main programme to your
hard disk. And, since catool is localized, it may be clever to copy
the catalog-file in your Locale-directory.
Perhaps it is useful to copy this documentation along with it.

An Installer-Script is not provided yet. This may change in future
releases of the package.
@endnode


@node config "catool - Configuration"
The only configurable items are changed via tool-types. These are:

  @{b}CATCOMP=<file>@{ub}
  You can give an alternate file&path for CatComp. Default is "CatComp".

  @{b}CATCOMPOUT=<file>@{ub}
  The output of CatComp is stored here. Default is "RAM:CatComp.out".

  @{b}CATALOGS=<dir>@{ub}
  The place of your catalogs-dir. Default is "LOCALE:Catalogs".

  @{b}REPLACETEXT=<string>@{ub}
  The string contains the standard (or selected) replace-text for
  "Scan Source". Default is "GetString(&li,%s)". See "" for more details.

  @{b}TRANS=<string>@{ub}
  On programme start there is only one language to translate your
  catalogs in. Default is "deutsch".

@node mainwin "catool - Main Window"
In this window you perform the actual creation and maintenanec of
your catalog-files.

With the cycle gadget in the first line you can choose the translated
language which is displayed in the list.
The buttons in the right of this gadget are used to add or remove a
language from the list. If you add a language, a window is opened where
you can enter the name of the language to be added. If you remove one
you always remove the current one which is impossible if you have
only one language in the list.

The list below these line displays the "messages" of your catalog
description and translations. With the other gadgets you can control
these messages.
Please note that you don't need to enter a number in the corresponding
field; catool counts for you - if you enter one, all the following
message numbers are changed. Enter a zero if you want to delete the
number.

With the cursor keys you are able to move in the list and change the
displayed language.
@endnode


@node param "catool - Parameter Window"
In this window you set up some parameters for your catalog-files.

In the upper group is only one string gadget where you enter the
version to be used in the "$VER"-line of your catalogs; the current
date is added there automatically.

In the first string gadget of the second group-box you define the
parameters of the CatComp-Command for the creation of source-files
and includes (see CatComp.doc for details).
This gadget accepts 2 commands:
 %f - inserts the base name of your project.
 %d - inserts the destination directory for your sources given in
      the second string gadget.
In the "Catalogs"-field you enter the directory where the #?.catalog-
files will be placed.

With the "New"- and the "Delete"-button you are able to define catalog
description commands such as #function. They are displayed in the list.
For more details on these commands, see CatComp.doc.
