The XRef-System is a collection of tools, which uses the xref.library to
manage cross-reference lists. The main purpose is, that you can search,
parse these xref-lists with patterns or just with normal strings. To manage
different aspects of documentations you can categorize the xref-files. In this
distribution there are some xref-files included, which contain all V40.15
AutoDoc and Includes entries (such as structures,defines or functions).
You can also convert C-Header- ,AutoDoc- and Unix-ManualPage files to
AmigaGuide files. It provides a little ARexx interface and more ... .
