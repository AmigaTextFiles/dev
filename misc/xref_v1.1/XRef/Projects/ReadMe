The XRef-System-Convert icon starts a Installer-script to generate
System XReffiles and System AmigaGuide Database !

All other icons starts only the appropriate tool :

Select an icon, shift-select the target directory or file
and double-click it to start the program !

Note: This works only if you have placed the XRef-Tools in a directory,
      the workbench have access to !
