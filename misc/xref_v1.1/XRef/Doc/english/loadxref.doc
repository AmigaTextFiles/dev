NAME
    LoadXRef - load a/some xreffiles for the xref.library into the memory

TEMPLATE
    FILES/M/A,PRI/N/K,LOCK/S,INDEX/S

FORMAT
    LoadXRef [FILES] file [file2 ..] [PRI priority] [LOCK] [INDEX]

FUNCTION
    loads the given xreffiles into the memory. The priority is used to sort
    the list of xreffiles.With the LOCK switch you can protect all xreffile 
    from removing from memory during a memory flush.

INPUTS
    FILES (STRINGS) - file(s) to be loaded into the memory

    PRI (NUMBER) - priority to be inserted in the list. Thus a high priority
        inserts a xreffile before others and therefor is parsed before others
        with lower priority

    LOCK (BOOLEAN) - if set, it locks all given xreffiles. Thus such files
        are not expunged during a system memory flush.

    INDEX (BOOLEAN) - if set, the xref.library creates a index array for all
        entries and uses for normal strcmp() , strncmp() a binary search
        algorithm !
