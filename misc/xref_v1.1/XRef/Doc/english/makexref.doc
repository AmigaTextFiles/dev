NAME
    MakeXRef - generate a xreffile for amigaguide from c-header, amigaguide,
               autodoc, unix man pages and normal doc files

TEMPLATE
    FROM/A/M,TO/A,CATEGORY/K,PATH/K,VERSION/N/K,REVISION/N/K,VERBOSE

FORMAT
    MakeXRef [FROM] file|dir [file2|dir2] [TO] file [CATEGORY category] 
             [PATH gpath] [VERSION versionnr] [REVISION revisionnr] [VERBOSE]

FUNCTION
    generate xref-file for use with xref.library.This tool scans any autodoc,
    amigaguide ,C-Header, unix man page and normal doc file. The following 
    entry types are recognized :
        in C-Header files :
        - normal define's
        - macro define's
        - structures
        - typedef's
        in autodoc,amigaguide, unix man page and normal doc files :
        - function's
        - command's (device command's for example)
        - generic (all other entries, which doesn't fit in the types above)

    If started from workbench, it opens a status window, which displays the
    current state of the program. Also it calculates the time to be used until
    the program finishes. Take just a look at !

INPUTS
    FROM    - File(s) or director(y|ies) to scan

    TO      - File to hold all xref-entries

    CATEGORY- category to use implicit for this xreffile (this is saved in
              the xreffile). Note this is the specification of the category,
              so you can't use any pattern !

    PATH    - global path, which is prepend to each filename for a entry, so
              you can build absolute filepath for a entry, this path is stored
              only once in a xreffile.

    VERSION - version of the created xreffile

    REVISION- revision of the created xreffile

    NOICON  - don't create a icon for the generated xreffile

    VERBOSE - switch, that indicate you want to see the found entries
