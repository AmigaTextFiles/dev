Cross-Reference-System (XRef-System)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to the XRef-System Version 1.1.

The XRef-System is a cross-reference system using the AmigaGuide Format to display
documents. It provides many more features than normal AmigaGuide XRefs. It is much
faster, more flexible and allows you to easily add own projects.

@node XRefSystem "XRef/XRef-System and Feature List"

The main reason for writing the @{b}XRef-System@{ub} was that the current implementation of
the amigaguide.library is very slow. Also, I wanted to integrate some concepts from
HotHelp (such as searching using patterns), which has the disadvantage of not
supporting the AmigaGuide document standard.
The result satisfies my demands, and I think it is a very useful utility especially
for programmers.
All programs and the library are compiled with SAS-C V6.50! (see Compiler and Software
@{"Tools" link "Tools"})

Note: All the links you see within this database are generated via the
      @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main} tool (except of three links, which I had to create manually).

These are the features the @{b}XRef-System@{ub} offers you:

         o generates xref entries for almost any C expression (#defines,
           #includes, structures, functions, typedefs etc.), for Commodore's
           autodoc file format, amigaguide files, and unix man pages.

         o @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main} - A tool to convert all common files to AmigaGuide
           databases (autodoc files, header files, doc files and other
           AmigaGuide files).
           Now implements an option to generate AmigaGuide files for use with
           the @{"amigaguide.datatype" link "amigaguide_dtc/amigaguide.datatype"} V40 and higher, using the smartwrap
           algorithm.

         o optional search with AmigaDOS patterns. In case of more than one
           entry is matching, @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} generates a temporary AmigaGuide database
           (@{"AGuideXRefV37" link AGuideXRefV37.guide/main}).

         o a new tool replacing AmigaGuide, which has a direct interface to
           the xref.library and some additional features (@{"AGuideXRefV39" link AGuideXRefV39.guide/main})

         o xref files can be held resident in memory (xref.library). It is
           also possible to lock individual databases, so that they can't be
           freed when memory is flushed.

         o xref.library can be configured via xref.prefs, with AUTOOPEN
           mechanism during xref.library startup and some global settings.

         o xref database files can have different priorities assigned, so that your
           most-used files are searched first (see @{"Enqueue()" link "exec/Enqueue()"}).

         o memory allocation is fully implemented using V39 memory pool functions
           (including the V37 library version)!

         o Dynamic AmigaGuide nodes for tables of:
               - xref files
               - all file references in an xref file
               - all generic entries
               - all function entries
               - all device command entries
               - all include file entries
               - all macro entries
               - all define entries
               - all structure entries
               - all typedef entries

         o categorization (with patterns) of @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} files gives you more flexibility.

         o binary search algorithm for normal strcmp()/strncmp()
           parse modes (@{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main} uses only these modes, therefore
           being very fast! Better than AD2AG utility from Commodore.)

         o GoldED API-Client @{"XRefAPI" link XRefAPI.guide/main} for completing phrases.
           For example, "ow" would be completed to "OpenWindow(".

         o Workbench support for all tools (some using a small status window)
           using FinalReadArgs() function (also included).

         o configuration directory can be specified with an environment
           variable

         o dynamically loadable xreffiles (see @{"Configuration-File" link "ConfigurationFile"}).

         o rexxxref.library ARexx function FindXRef() to use the @{b}XRef-System@{ub}
           from ARexx

         If you missed a feature, please contact me (see @{"Address" link "Address"}).

@endnode

@node ConfigurationFile "XRef/Configuration-File"

The configuration file "xref.prefs"

This file should be placed in your "Sys:@{"Config/XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146}" directory.
If you don't want to put it there, you can specify a directory with the
XREFCONFIGDIR environment variable.

The file must be an ASCII text and is parsed line-oriented. Each line is
interpreted to match one of the following templates (using @{"ReadArgs()" link "dos/ReadArgs()"}) :

    - AUTOOPEN/S/A,FILE/K/A,XREFPRI/N/K,LOCK/S,INDEX/S
    - AUTOLOAD/S/A,FILE/K/A,XREFPRI/N/K,LOCK/S,INDEX/S
    - MAINPAGE/S/A,LINELENGTH/N/K/A,COLUMNS/N/K/A
    - CLEANUP/S/A,FORCE/S
    - XREFDIR/S/A,DIR/A/K

    AUTOOPEN
        This type of entry may exist several times in a prefs file.
        It specifies an @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} file to be opened when parsing this
        file. The specified arguments are passed to the @{"XR_LoadXRef()" link "xref/XR_LoadXRef()"}
        function. (see this document for further informations).

    AUTOLOAD
        This entry specifies @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} files to be automatically loaded if an
        entry wasn't found in the @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} files in memory.

    MAINPAGE
        This entry specifies the line length and the column number which
        will be used for all dynamic node layouts . Thus you can set
        these values appropriate to your screen/window resolution.

    @{"CLEANUP" link "AG:SysInc/hardware/blit.h/main" 99}
        If this line appears in a prefs file, all @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} files are flushed (removed)
        from memory. If you specify the FORCE switch additionally, locked @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146}
        files are also flushed.

    XREFDIR
        If you specify this line, the given path is used as the default path for
        load @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} files.

Note: @{"ReadArgs()" link "dos/ReadArgs()"} doesn't support the "/S/A" combination, this is checked separately.

@node Installation "XRef/Installation"

Installation
============

Simply run the Installer script in the Install directory. Make sure, that
you have the Installer program in the Sys:Utilities directory, or on
another place, where the workbench can find it.

Here is a short description, what and where this script installs on your
system :

It copies the xref.library to your LIBS: directory according to your
kickstart version a V37 or a V39 library.

The configuration files for the library and the tools are copied to
Sys:config/xref or to a specified directory. I decided this default location
instead of ENV: because these files aren't changed often, so I think it isn't worth
wasting RAM! The following files are copied:

      keywords     - used by @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main}
      keywords.v40 - used by @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main}
      exceptions   - used by @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main}
      xref.prefs   - used by xref.library during library startup

The script sets the xref.prefs file correctly for you. You can add any
@{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} file that should be loaded directly after the library init. Simply add a
line like

    AUTOOPEN myxreffile.xref LOCK

or see section "The configuration file" for a more detailed descriptions of
xref.prefs.

If you have installed the GoldEd Editor, the Installer script copies the
xrefaguide.ged ARexx macro to the GoldEd:ARexx directory.

All other files are copied to the place you specify via the Installer.

@endnode

@node Library "XRef/XRef.Library"

The xref.library is the fundament of the @{b}XRef-System@{ub}. It provides functions
to load, expunge and parse @{"XRef" link "AG:SysInc/libraries/amigaguide.h/main" 146} database files. The library can be configured
using a file named xref.prefs. See section "The configuration file" or the
@{"LoadXRefPrefs()" link "xref/LoadXRefPrefs()"} doc for further details.

In low memory situations, all libraries that aren't used currently
are flushed. For this case, the xref.library has a locking mechanism for
xref files. If you loaded an xref file with the LOCK switch turned on, this
xref file isn't flushed, and the library neither. Thus you can decide if the
xref.library should removed during a memory flush or not.

@node HowToUse "XRef/How to use it for own projects"

If you want to generate xref files for your own projects or to build all AutoDocs,
you have to follow these steps:

1. Generate an xref file from your C-Header or AutoDoc files.
   The category option string is put into the generated file, therefore do not
   specify the category explicitly ! (Note that if you set a global XRefPath,
   you can only use the filenames as shown here!)

   Example: Generate two xref file for the directories include:myincludes and
   docs:mydocs :

      @{"MakeXRef" link MakeXRef.guide/main} FROM include:myincludes TO myinclude.xref \\
               CATEGORY Include VERBOSE

      @{"MakeXRef" link MakeXRef.guide/main} FROM docs:mydocs TO mydocs.xref CATEGORY AutoDoc \\
               VERBOSE

2. Load the generated files into memory:

      @{"LoadXRef" link LoadXRef.guide/main} myinclude.xref mydocs.xref PRI 5

3. Convert the include's and autodoc's to amigaguide databases:

      @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main} FROM include:myincludes TO AMIGAGUIDE:Includes VERBOSE

      @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main} FROM docs:mydocs TO AMIGAGUIDE:AutoDocs VERBOSE

4. If everything went alright, the result is one or more AmigaGuide files in the
   AMIGAGUIDE:Includes and/or AMIGAGUIDE:AutoDocs directories.

@node ToDo "XRef/To Do"

Work I'd like to do :

- a new gadgetclass for V39 and above, which integrates the amigaguide
  datatype and a direct interface to the xref.library (this is currently the
  @{"AGuideXRefV39" link AGuideXRefV39.guide/main} program)

- a complete ARexx interface to the xref.library, at the moment only the
  FindXRef(),LoadXRef() and ExpungeXRef() functions are available from ARexx
  using the rexxxref.library

- perhaps a Preference editor

- localization of all tools (only the @{"AGuideXRefV39" link AGuideXRefV39.guide/main} uses a catalog) (?)

- Maybe in future a new amigaguide class, which supports graphics and/or
  other datatype formats. (But for this, I need a full documentation of the
  @{"amigaguide.datatype" link "amigaguide_dtc/amigaguide.datatype"}. With a system monitor, I found out that the amigaguide
  datatype has 13 LVO function entry points. Where are the docs? @{"Thanks" link "Thanks"} to
  Commodore for these not accessible docs... Arghhh!!!)

- More flexible @{"MakeXRef" link MakeXRef.guide/main} and @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main}, that allows to add new scanners
  for different languages.

- perhaps support of pipes for @{"MakeXRef" link MakeXRef.guide/main} and @{"XRefConvert" link XRefConvert.guide/main}

@node SWTools "XRef/Compiler and Software Tools"

Compilers used:

DICE-C     @{TAB} This isn't a tool but a great PD/SW C-Compiler I am using for
V2.07.54   @{TAB} two years. Meanwhile I switched to SAS-C, but I look out for the
           @{TAB} commercial version of DICE. I am still using the DMake make
           @{TAB} utility for my projects.

SAS-C      @{TAB} The best C-Compiler for the Amiga. Think about the optimizer.
V6.51      @{TAB} He reduces 2K from the xref.library .

GNU-C      @{TAB} I used this compiler for porting some unix tools and programs.
V2.6.0     @{TAB} The Amiga port of the GNU-C/C++ compiler makes it easy to port
           @{TAB} unix sources to the Amiga. @{"Thanks" link "Thanks"} to Markus Wild (ixemul.library)
           @{TAB} for his work in this area, also to Fred Fish, Philippe Brand and
           @{TAB} Lars Hecking for porting the latest version of GNU-C.

Software-Tools used:

Enforcer   @{TAB} A tool to detect illegal memory access. Great!

findhit,   @{TAB} @{"Tools" link "Tools"} to find enforcer/mungwall hits in the source code. This
findline   @{TAB} works only if you have turned line debugging on

DOSTrace   @{TAB} A Program that protocols dos.library function calls like @{"Open()" link "dos/Open()"}
           @{TAB} @{"Read()" link "serial/CMD_READ"}, @{"Write()" link "serial/CMD_WRITE"}, @{"Lock()" link "dos/Lock()"}, @{"UnLock()" link "dos/UnLock()"}, ...

makedoc    @{TAB} tool to extract documentation from source code or any other
           @{TAB} Textfile. It's just like autodoc from Commodore DevCon disks,
           @{TAB} but has a more flexible extraction and language support.

pragma_gen @{TAB} tool to generate SAS-C pragma files. This program generates
           @{TAB} also tagcall pragmas.

@node AGSetup "XRef/AmigaGuide Setup and Problems"

There are some rules you have to follow, if the @{b}XRef-System@{ub} should work correctly
with AmigaGuide:

Setup:

 - You must setup the ENV:AmigaGuide/Path file correctly. In this
   file, you have to setup all directories with full pathnames,
   where all your AmigaGuide databases reside (on one line, separated by spaces).

Problems :

 - For include files and all other files that have only a main node or links
   with a line number, the ENV:AmigaGuide/Path directories doesn't work due to
   a bug of AmigaGuide (I suppose). To fix this, generate xref entries for such
   files with full pathnames like this:

       @{"MakeXRef" link MakeXRef.guide/main} FROM include: TO include.xref CATEGORY Include PATH AG:SysInc

   In this release, I included the include-xref files with the "AG:SysInc"
   global path for the system includes and "AG:OtherInc" global path for the
   xref-includes. Note that this global path is only stored one time in a xreffile,
   so it doesn't take up much disk or memory space; yet the full path is used in all
   dynamic nodes and in generated AmigaGuide files. Therefore, make sure that the
   specified path name is not too long.

 - The @{"amigaguide.datatype" link "amigaguide_dtc/amigaguide.datatype"} and DOSTrace 2.12 don't work together:
   If DOSTrace is running, the @{"amigaguide.datatype" link "amigaguide_dtc/amigaguide.datatype"} cannot open any database.
   I have no idea why this happens.

   You can test this with MultiView or any other program that uses this
   datatype.

   These problems appeared in amigaguide.library V40.4 and @{"amigaguide.datatype" link "amigaguide_dtc/amigaguide.datatype"}
   V40.11 (my actual system version).

Compatibility:

 - the column support works only with V40 and above. I used new features
   from the @{"amigaguide.datatype" link "amigaguide_dtc/amigaguide.datatype"} V40 (settabs)!
