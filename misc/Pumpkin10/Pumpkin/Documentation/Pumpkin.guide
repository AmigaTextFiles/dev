  Click on the installer icon to start the installation.

  Manual installation is not recommended.

@NODE Authenticity "Authenticity"

 @{b}Authenticity@{ub}

  All executables and main documentation are PGP signed with my key
  (below).

  To check if the files are authentic first save the key below to a
  separate file. Start PGP with the filename of that separate file and
  add my key to your keyring. Now you are ready to check the files with
  my key.

  To check a signed file start PGP with the '.sig' file as the first
  argument and as the second argument the file which is related to the
  '.sig' file.

  E.g.: 1:> PGP Pumpkin.sig Pumpkin

@NODE Introduction "Introduction to Pumpkin"

 @{b}About@{ub}

  Pumpkin is copyright © 1996 Martin Wulffeld. All Rights Reserved.

  It uses the ReqTools library which is copyright © Nico François.

  Pumpkin requires at least Kickstart 3.0.

 @{b}What it does@{ub}

  Pumpkin is a C function and structure lister for CygnusEd. You might
  already have an idea of what such a lister does. When activated Pumpkin
  scans the current active file in CygnusEd and finds the C functions and
  C structures that were possible to find. Thereafter, it opens a window
  on the screen CygnusEd with a list of the functions and structures found.
  From this window you can via the keyboard fast and easily jump between
  the functions and structures in your source.
@ENDNODE

@NODE GettingUpdates "Getting updates of Pumpkin"

 @{b}Getting updates@{ub}

  Whenever a new version of Pumpkin is released it will be uploaded to:

   - @{b}Insomnia@{ub}:

     Node #1 +45 98380575 24H 28k8  2:238/127.0@FidoNet

     Node #2 +45 43624147 24H 28k8  2:236/75.0@FidoNet

   - On @{b}Aminet@{ub} in the 'dev/misc' directory.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Usage.Launching "Launching Pumpkin"

 @{b}Launching@{ub}

  The only way to start Pumpkin is by using the CLI as it requires the
  filename of the source in CygnusEd in order to scan it and the only way
  to obtain this filename is via the @{"FILE" LINK Usage.Launching} argument.

  CygnusEd must be in "public" mode meaning that 'Rendering choices' must
  be set to 'Make screen public'. Otherwise, Pumpkin can't open on
  CygnusEd's screen.

  If you have followed the install procedure you should have installed
  Pumpkin perfectly. If not here is what should be done:

   1. Edit the ARexx script 'Pumpkin.rexx' so it in the line with the
      'address command' finds the Pumpkin executable.
   
   2. Attach the ARexx script to a function key in CygnusEd using the
      'Install DOS/ARexx command...' situated in the Special menu.

   3. Done! Press the function key to activate Pumpkin. If there are
      no functions and structures in the file it will not open its
      window.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Usage.CLI "The CLI"

 @{b}The command line interface@{ub}

  Pumpkin's CLI template can be shown by performing a 'Pumpkin ?' at your
  CLI prompt. The template is:

   CX_POPKEY/K,CX_PRIORITY/N,SORT/S,FILE/K/A,WIDTH/N,HEIGHT/N

  @{b}CX_POPKEY@{ub}

   The popkey for Pumpkin. Default is 'control alt p'.

  @{b}CX_PRIORITY@{ub}

   The priority of the commodity. Default is 0.

  @{b}SORT@{ub}

   Sorts the functions and structures alphabetically when started. They
   are by default sorted by line number.

  @{b}FILE@{ub}

   The name of your source file. Because there is a bug in CygnusEd's
   message routines an ARexx script was the only way to go in order to
   retrieve the filename from CygnusEd.

  @{b}WIDTH@{ub}

   WIDTH is the alternative width of the window which Pumpkin opens on the
   CygnusEd screen.

  @{b}HEIGHT@{ub}

   HEIGHT is the alternative height of the window which Pumpkin opens on
   the CygnusEd screen.
@ENDNODE

@NODE Usage.GUI "The GUI"

 @{b}The GUI@{ub}

  To move to a function or structure you can use the mouse and for
  extra conveniance you can also use the up and down cursors. Using
  shift in conjunction with the cursor keys will move 2 entries and
  using alt will move either to the top or bottom of the list.

  The more you modify your source the line numbers for the various
  functions and structures will become more and more inaccurate.
  In order to solve that problem you will have to save your source
  and run Pumpkin again.

  The following are descriptions of the few gadgets in the window:

  @{b}About@{ub}

   Shows information on Pumpkin.

  @{b}Help@{ub}

   Will load and show the 'Pumpkin.guide' from the directory where Pumpkin
   was started from.

  @{b}Sort@{ub}

   Sorts the functions and structures either alphabetically or by
   linenumber. It switches between the two every time the gadget is
   pressed.
@ENDNODE

@NODE YourSource "Your source"

 @{b}Your source@{ub}

  Pumpkin can not check for all possible programming styles so there are a
  few restrictions as to how your functions and structures should look
  like.

   @{" Functions " LINK YourSource.Functions}
   @{" Structs   " LINK YourSource.Structures}

   Pumpkin recognizes both C and C++ (nested) comments and skips whatever
   functions/structures they may hide.
@ENDNODE

@NODE YourSource.Functions "Your source : Functions"

 @{b}Functions@{ub}

  The '{' that marks the beginning of a function must be at the beginning
  of the line that follows the function header hence the following 2 will
  not be found:

int foo( int bar ) {

int foo2( int bar2 )
   {

  However the next functions will be found:

  foo()
{

foo()
{

int foo()
{

void foo( int cantona_rewls )
{
@ENDNODE

@NODE YourSource.Structures "Your source : Structures"

 @{b}Structures@{ub}

   As with functions there are certain programming styles to be followed
   when it comes to structures. Again '{' must be at the beginning of the
   line. The following 2 structures will not be found:

struct Giggs {

struct Neville
 {

   The following structures will be found:

struct Television
{

struct Wizard
{

 struct EyeBall
{
