Thanks for the assist. :-)

Revision 6.11 of the Amiga Guru ROM, a replacement driver
for GVP host adapters, allows you to "partition" hard disks
into virtual 4-GB units via the 1000s digit of the Exec unit
number. This way, you can make use of a hard disk's entire
storage capacity even if its size exceeds 4 gigabytes (2^32
bytes). No new filesystem is required. All it takes is one
or more extra MountList entries. (Of course, it is still
possible to install third-party filesystems that employ the
HD_SCSICMD interface to break the 4-GB barrier.)

Furthermore, this revision of the omniscsi.device implements
the new 64-bit API agreed upon by a group of third-party
Amiga developers. The specification for this API can be
found on Olaf Barthel's Amiga Developer CD:

  Amiga_Dev_CD_v1.1:Contributions/Ralph_Babel/Development/trackdisk64

The file is also available via FTP:

  ftp://ftp.pfm-mainz.de/pub/amiga/trackdisk64.lha

(I'd nonetheless recommend that you get Olaf's CD.)

I have also been informed by Ralph Schmidt that all
version-7 SCSI drivers from Phase 5 (e.g. cybscsi.device)
support this new 64-bit trackdisk API. According to him, v7
drivers have been shipping for quite a while, so your
Phase-5 product may already be equipped with one of them.
