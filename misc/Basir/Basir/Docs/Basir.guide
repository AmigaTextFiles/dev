 INTRODUCTION


 Have you ever thought about porting your old Commodore Basic programs to
 Amiga but given up the idea because getting the program listings to
 Amiga-readable form would require too much effort?

 Would it not be easier to port a program if the source code was plain ASCII
 text instead of a mixture of tokens, characters and 16 bit integers? Yes, it
 certainly would be!

 And this is exactly what Basir does: it converts Commodore Basic program
 files into plain ASCII text and thus allows you not only to view the source
 code but to edit and annotate it as well.

 Basir is a freeware [AMITY] product.

 RUNNING BASIR


 @{b}Running from Workbench@{ub}

 Executable file

  BasirGUI

 Tooltypes

   none

 Basir is a CLI-only program but it can be run from Workbench by using
 supplied GUI-front-end, BasirGUI.

 BasirGUI expands Basir with an interactive mode by which you are allowed to
 choose the Basic source file first and then to save the ASCII form source
 code into a file of your choise.

 Double click "BasirGUI" icon to run Basir from Workbench.

 @{b}Running from CLI@{ub}

 Format

   Basir <file>

 Arguments

  <file>

   Name of the Basic program file.

 When the name of the Basic program file is supplied, Basir lists contents of
 the file (Basic source code) in a CLI window. The <file> argument is
 compulsory.
@endnode

@node "Usage" "Usage"

 USAGE


 Basir can be executed from CLI or from WB through special GUI-front-end.

 @{b}Running@{ub}

 @{" WB tooltypes  " link "Running" 5} Running Basir from WB.
 @{" CLI arguments " link "Running" 25} Running Basir from CLI.

 @{b}How to list a Basic program?@{ub}

 If you just want to list the contents of a Basic program file, Basir must be
 executed from Shell:

   Basir <file>

 Where <file> is the name of the Basic file, contents of which you want to
 see.

 @{b}How to create a plain ASCII source file?@{ub}

 The easiest way to create a plain ASCII source file from a Basic program file
 is to execute BasirGUI. You can find more information about BasirGUI from
 @{"here" link "Running" 0}.

 If you prefer using Basir's CLI interface, you must redirect Basir's output
 to a file in order to create an ASCII source file.

 If you want to create an ASCII source file named "HelloWorld.bas" from the
 Basic program file "HELLOWORLD", type the following line in a shell window:

   Basir >HelloWorld.bas HELLOWORLD

 The right angle bracket redirects the console output to the destination
 indicated by the bracket, in this case to the file "HelloWorld.bas".

 FAQ


 Q: Can I convert VIC-20 and Commodore 64 Basic programs into plain ASCII
    files with Basir?
 A: Yes, you can. All CBM Basic versions from 1.0 to 3.5 are supported.
    Note that third party Basic languages are not supported.

 Q: Why does the source code contain {xx} trash?
 A: 8-bit Commodore computers use non-standard characters and control codes.
    Basir displays these non-printable characters and codes in 8-bit
    hexadecimal numbers, enclosed in brackets.
    Typical non-printable characters are cursor control codes
    (left/up/right/down), home, and clear codes, which are common in PRINT
    statements.
