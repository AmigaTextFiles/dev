BASIR - LAST MINUTE NOTES

For an unknown reason LhA does not preserve file flags which causes 
problems with viewing original Basic example files.

You can fix the problem by setting the S flag in the following files:

 PROTECT Examples/HelloWorld/TypeHex S ADD
 PROTECT Examples/Sin/TypeHex S ADD

In addition to this, file BasirGUI should have S flag set:

 PROTECT BasirGUI S ADD
