Backbone Installation
---------------------

Run the installation program to install Backbone. It will automatically
create a directory named Backbone. It will also update any previous version
of Backbone as long as you select the correct directory. 
e.g. If you're current version of Backbone is in Work:Programs/Backbone then 
select Work:Programs in the installer.

To install Backbone manually....
Copy all LIBS into your LIBS drawer.
Copy everything else into any other drawer (naming it Backbone would be a
good idea)

This is how the directory structure should look, you'll have to create some
of the drawers yourself as LHA doesn't like empty drawers.
