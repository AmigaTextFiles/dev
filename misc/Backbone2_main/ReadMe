Backbone2
---------
NOTE: There are two archives for Backbone2. Backbone2_main.Lha contains all
the main programs and files to run it. Backbone2_ex.Lha contains several
example projects including the graphics and sound to go with them. These
will be very useful if you've never used Backbone before!

What Is It?
-----------
A game creation system that requires no programming knowledge at all.
Capable of creating various types of games including:
Side Viewed (such as Mario Bros)
Above Viewed (such as Chaos Engine)
Both Space type, Platform type, Cannon Fodder type... you name it!
You simply create the graphics (or use the examples supplied) and set the
various options (speed of player, placement of enemies etc.)

Very powerful with huge potential and will continue to be improved as 
long as I get some feedback!!!

Latest Version
--------------
New for version 2. Now runs as a Workbench application. Full Gad Tools
interface, any screen mode!
Read the AmigaGuide manual for full details on all updates.
