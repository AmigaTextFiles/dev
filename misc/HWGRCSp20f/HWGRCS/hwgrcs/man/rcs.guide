@{b}NAME@{ub}
       rcsintro - introduction to RCS commands

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       The  Revision  Control System (RCS) manages multiple revi-
       sions of files.  RCS  automates  the  storing,  retrieval,
       logging, identification, and merging of revisions.  RCS is
       useful for text that is revised  frequently,  for  example
       programs,  documentation,  graphics, papers, and form let-
       ters.

       The basic user interface is extremely simple.  The  novice
       only  needs  to  learn two commands: @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub} and @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}.  @{b}ci@{ub},
       short for "check in", deposits the contents of a file into
       an archival file called an RCS file.  An RCS file contains
       all revisions of a particular file.  @{b}co@{ub}, short for  "check
       out", retrieves revisions from an RCS file.

   @{b}Functions@{ub} @{b}of@{ub} @{b}RCS@{ub}
             Store and retrieve multiple revisions of text.  RCS
              saves all old revisions in a space  efficient  way.
              Changes no longer destroy the original, because the
              previous revisions  remain  accessible.   Revisions
              can  be  retrieved  according to ranges of revision
              numbers,  symbolic  names,  dates,   authors,   and
              states.

             Maintain  a  complete history of changes.  RCS logs
              all changes automatically.   Besides  the  text  of
              each  revision, RCS stores the author, the date and
              time of check-in, and a log message summarizing the
              change.  The logging makes it easy to find out what
              happened to a module,  without  having  to  compare
              source listings or having to track down colleagues.

             Resolve access conflicts.  When two  or  more  pro-
              grammers  wish  to  modify  the  same revision, RCS
              alerts the programmers and prevents  one  modifica-
              tion from corrupting the other.

             Maintain  a  tree  of  revisions.  RCS can maintain
              separate lines of development for each module.   It
              stores  a tree structure that represents the ances-
              tral relationships among revisions.

             Merge revisions and resolve conflicts.   Two  sepa-
              rate  lines  of development of a module can be coa-
              lesced by merging.  If the revisions to  be  merged
              affect  the  same  sections of code, RCS alerts the
              user about the overlapping changes.

             Control releases and configurations.  Revisions can
              be  assigned symbolic names and marked as released,
              stable, experimental, etc.  With these  facilities,
              configurations  of  modules can be described simply
              and directly.

             Automatically identify  each  revision  with  name,
              revision  number,  creation time, author, etc.  The
              identification is like a stamp that can be embedded
              at  an appropriate place in the text of a revision.
              The identification makes  it  simple  to  determine
              which  revisions  of  which modules make up a given
              configuration.

             Minimize secondary storage.  RCS needs little extra
              space for the revisions (only the differences).  If
              intermediate revisions are deleted, the correspond-
              ing deltas are compressed accordingly.

   @{b}Getting@{ub} @{b}Started@{ub} @{b}with@{ub} @{b}RCS@{ub}
       Suppose  you  have  a  file @{b}f.c@{ub} that you wish to put under
       control of RCS.  If you have not already done so, make  an
       RCS directory with the command

              @{b}mkdir@{ub}  @{b}RCS@{ub}

       Then invoke the check-in command

              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       This  command  creates  an  RCS file in the @{b}RCS@{ub} directory,
       stores @{b}f.c@{ub} into it as revision 1.1, and deletes  @{b}f.c@{ub}.   It
       also  asks  you for a description.  The description should
       be a synopsis of the contents  of  the  file.   All  later
       check-in  commands  will  ask  you  for a log entry, which
       should summarize the changes that you made.

       Files in the RCS directory are called RCS files; the  oth-
       ers  are  called  working  files.  To get back the working
       file @{b}f.c@{ub} in the previous example, use the  check-out  com-
       mand

              @{b}co@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       This  command  extracts  the  latest revision from the RCS
       file and writes it into @{b}f.c@{ub}.  If you want to edit @{b}f.c@{ub}, you
       must lock it as you check it out with the command

              @{b}co@{ub}  @{b}-l@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       You can now edit @{b}f.c@{ub}.

       Suppose  after  some editing you want to know what changes
       that you have made.  The command

              @{b}rcsdiff@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       tells  you  the  difference  between  the  most   recently
       checked-in  version  and  the working file.  You can check
       the file back in by invoking

              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       This increments the revision number properly.

       If @{b}ci@{ub} complains with the message

              @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}error:@{ub} @{b}no@{ub} @{b}lock@{ub} @{b}set@{ub} @{b}by@{ub} @{u}your@{uu} @{u}name@{uu}

       then you have tried to check in a file even though you did
       not lock it when you checked it out.  Of course, it is too
       late now to do the check-out with locking, because another
       check-out  would  overwrite  your modifications.  Instead,
       invoke

              @{b}rcs@{ub}  @{b}-l@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       This command will lock the latest revision for you, unless
       somebody  else  got  ahead  of you already.  In this case,
       you'll have to negotiate with that person.

       Locking assures that you, and only you, can check  in  the
       next  update,  and avoids nasty problems if several people
       work on the same file.  Even if a revision is  locked,  it
       can still be checked out for reading, compiling, etc.  All
       that locking prevents is a @{u}check-in@{uu}  by  anybody  but  the
       locker.

       If  your  RCS  file  is private, i.e., if you are the only
       person who is going to deposit revisions into  it,  strict
       locking  is not needed and you can turn it off.  If strict
       locking is turned off, the owner of the RCS file need  not
       have  a  lock  for check-in; all others still do.  Turning
       strict locking off and on is done with the commands

              @{b}rcs@{ub}  @{b}-U@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}     and     @{b}rcs@{ub}  @{b}-L@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       If you don't want to clutter your working  directory  with
       RCS  files, create a subdirectory called @{b}RCS@{ub} in your work-
       ing directory, and move all your  RCS  files  there.   RCS
       commands  will  look  first  into  that  directory to find
       needed files.  All the commands discussed above will still
       work,  without  any modification.  (Actually, pairs of RCS
       and working files can be specified in three ways: (a) both
       are  given,  (b)  only the working file is given, (c) only
       the RCS file is given.  Both RCS  and  working  files  may
       have  arbitrary  path  prefixes; RCS commands pair them up
       intelligently.)

       To avoid the deletion of the working file during  check-in
       (in  case  you  want  to  continue  editing or compiling),
       invoke

              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}-l@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}     or     @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}-u@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       These commands check in  @{b}f.c@{ub}  as  usual,  but  perform  an
       implicit check-out.  The first form also locks the checked
       in revision, the second one doesn't.  Thus, these  options
       save  you one check-out operation.  The first form is use-
       ful if you want to continue editing, the second one if you
       just  want  to read the file.  Both update the identifica-
       tion markers in your working file (see below).

       You can give @{b}ci@{ub} the number you want assigned to a  checked
       in revision.  Assume all your revisions were numbered 1.1,
       1.2, 1.3, etc., and you would like  to  start  release  2.
       The command

              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}-r2@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}     or     @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}-r2.1@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       assigns the number 2.1 to the new revision.  From then on,
       @{b}ci@{ub} will number the subsequent  revisions  with  2.2,  2.3,
       etc.  The corresponding @{b}co@{ub} commands

              @{b}co@{ub}  @{b}-r2@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}     and     @{b}co@{ub}  @{b}-r2.1@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       retrieve the latest revision numbered 2.@{u}x@{uu} and the revision
       2.1, respectively.  @{b}co@{ub} without a revision  number  selects
       the  latest  revision on the @{u}trunk@{uu}, i.e. the highest revi-
       sion with a number consisting of two fields.  Numbers with
       more  than  two fields are needed for branches.  For exam-
       ple, to start a branch at revision 1.3, invoke

              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}-r1.3.1@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       This command starts a branch numbered 1 at  revision  1.3,
       and  assigns  the number 1.3.1.1 to the new revision.  For
       more information about branches, see @{b}@{"rcsfile" link RCSFILE}@{ub}.

   @{b}Automatic@{ub} @{b}Identification@{ub}
       RCS can put special strings for identification  into  your
       source  and  object  code.  To obtain such identification,
       place the marker

              @{b}$Id$@{ub}

       into your text, for instance inside a comment.   RCS  will
       replace this marker with a string of the form

              @{b}$Id:@{ub}  @{u}filename@{uu}  @{u}revision@{uu}  @{u}date@{uu}  @{u}time@{uu}  @{u}author@{uu}  @{u}state@{uu}
              @{b}$@{ub}

       With such a marker on the first page of each  module,  you
       can  always  see with which revision you are working.  RCS
       keeps the markers up to date automatically.  To  propagate
       the  markers  into  your object code, simply put them into
       literal character strings.  In C, this is done as follows:

              @{b}static@{ub} @{b}char@{ub} @{b}rcsid[]@{ub} @{b}=@{ub} @{b}"$Id$";@{ub}

       The  command  @{b}ident@{ub}  extracts  such markers from any file,
       even object code and dumps.  Thus, @{b}ident@{ub} lets you find out
       which revisions of which modules were used in a given pro-
       gram.

       You may also find it useful to put the marker  @{b}$Log$@{ub}  into
       your  text, inside a comment.  This marker accumulates the
       log messages that are requested  during  check-in.   Thus,
       you  can  maintain  the  complete  history  of  your  file
       directly inside it.  There are several additional  identi-
       fication markers; see @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub} for details.

@{b}NAME@{ub}
       ci - check in RCS revisions

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}ci@{ub} [@{u}options@{uu}] @{u}file@{uu} ...

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}ci@{ub}  stores  new  revisions  into RCS files.  Each pathname
       matching an RCS suffix is taken to be an  RCS  file.   All
       others  are  assumed  to  be  working files containing new
       revisions.  @{b}ci@{ub} deposits the contents of each working  file
       into  the  corresponding RCS file.  If only a working file
       is given, @{b}ci@{ub} tries to find the corresponding RCS  file  in
       an  RCS subdirectory and then in the working file's direc-
       tory.  For more details, see FILE NAMING below.

       For @{b}ci@{ub} to work, the caller's login must be on  the  access
       list,  except if the access list is empty or the caller is
       the superuser or the owner of the file.  To append  a  new
       revision  to  an existing branch, the tip revision on that
       branch must be locked by the caller.   Otherwise,  only  a
       new  branch  can  be  created.   This  restriction  is not
       enforced for the owner of the file if  non-strict  locking
       is  used (see @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub}).  A lock held by someone else can be
       broken with the @{b}rcs@{ub} command.

       Unless the @{b}-f@{ub} option is given, @{b}ci@{ub} checks whether the revi-
       sion  to  be deposited differs from the preceding one.  If
       not, instead of creating a new revision @{b}ci@{ub} reverts to  the
       preceding one.  To revert, ordinary @{b}ci@{ub} removes the working
       file and any lock; @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}-l@{ub} keeps and @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}-u@{ub} removes any lock,
       and  then they both generate a new working file much as if
       @{b}co@{ub} @{b}-l@{ub} or @{b}co@{ub} @{b}-u@{ub} had been applied to the preceding revision.
       When reverting, any @{b}-n@{ub} and @{b}-s@{ub} options apply to the preced-
       ing revision.

       For each revision deposited, @{b}ci@{ub} prompts for a log message.
       The  log  message  should summarize the change and must be
       terminated by end-of-file or by  a  line  containing  @{b}.@{ub} by
       itself.   If  several files are checked in @{b}ci@{ub} asks whether
       to reuse the previous log message.  If the standard  input
       is  not  a terminal, @{b}ci@{ub} suppresses the prompt and uses the
       same log message for all files.  See also @{b}-m@{ub}.

       If the RCS file does not exist, @{b}ci@{ub} creates it and deposits
       the  contents  of the working file as the initial revision
       (default number: @{b}1.1@{ub}).  The access list is initialized  to
       empty.   Instead  of the log message, @{b}ci@{ub} requests descrip-
       tive text (see @{b}-t@{ub} below).

       The number @{u}rev@{uu} of the deposited revision can be  given  by
       any  of the options @{b}-f@{ub}, @{b}-i@{ub}, @{b}-I@{ub}, @{b}-j@{ub}, @{b}-k@{ub}, @{b}-l@{ub}, @{b}-M@{ub}, @{b}-q@{ub}, @{b}-r@{ub}, or
       @{b}-u@{ub}.  @{u}rev@{uu} can be symbolic,  numeric,  or  mixed.   Symbolic
       names  in  @{u}rev@{uu}  must already be defined; see the @{b}-n@{ub} and @{b}-N@{ub}
       options for assigning names during checkin.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is  @{b}$@{ub},
       @{b}ci@{ub}  determines  the revision number from keyword values in
       the working file.

       If @{u}rev@{uu} begins with a period, then the default branch (nor-
       mally  the  trunk) is prepended to it.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is a branch
       number followed by a period, then the latest  revision  on
       that branch is used.

       If  @{u}rev@{uu}  is  a revision number, it must be higher than the
       latest one on the branch to which  @{u}rev@{uu}  belongs,  or  must
       start a new branch.

       If  @{u}rev@{uu} is a branch rather than a revision number, the new
       revision is appended to that branch.  The level number  is
       obtained  by  incrementing the tip revision number of that
       branch.  If @{u}rev@{uu}  indicates  a  non-existing  branch,  that
       branch  is  created  with  the  initial  revision numbered
       @{u}rev@{b}.1@{ub}@{uu}.

       If @{u}rev@{uu} is omitted, @{b}ci@{ub} tries to  derive  the  new  revision
       number  from  the  caller's  last lock.  If the caller has
       locked the tip revision of a branch, the new  revision  is
       appended  to  that  branch.   The  new  revision number is
       obtained by incrementing the tip revision number.  If  the
       caller  locked a non-tip revision, a new branch is started
       at that revision by incrementing the highest branch number
       at  that  revision.   The default initial branch and level
       numbers are @{b}1@{ub}.

       If @{u}rev@{uu} is omitted and the caller has no lock, but owns the
       file  and  locking is not set to @{u}strict@{uu}, then the revision
       is appended to the default branch (normally the trunk; see
       the @{b}-b@{ub} option of @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub}).

       Exception:  On the trunk, revisions can be appended to the
       end, but not inserted.

@{b}OPTIONS@{ub}
       @{b}-r@{u}rev@{ub}@{uu}  Check in revision @{u}rev@{uu}.

       @{b}-r@{ub}     The bare @{b}-r@{ub} option (without any  revision)  has  an
              unusual  meaning in @{b}ci@{ub}.  With other RCS commands, a
              bare @{b}-r@{ub} option specifies the most  recent  revision
              on  the  default  branch,  but  with  @{b}ci@{ub}, a bare @{b}-r@{ub}
              option  reestablishes  the  default   behavior   of
              releasing a lock and removing the working file, and
              is used to override any default @{b}-l@{ub}  or  @{b}-u@{ub}  options
              established by shell aliases or scripts.

       @{b}-l@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              works  like  @{b}-r@{ub},  except  it performs an additional
              @{b}co@{ub} @{b}-l@{ub}  for  the  deposited  revision.   Thus,   the
              deposited revision is immediately checked out again
              and locked.  This is useful for saving  a  revision
              although one wants to continue editing it after the
              checkin.

       @{b}-u@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              works like @{b}-l@{ub}, except that the  deposited  revision
              is not locked.  This lets one read the working file
              immediately after checkin.

              The @{b}-l@{ub}, bare @{b}-r@{ub}, and @{b}-u@{ub} options are mutually exclu-
              sive  and  silently override each other.  For exam-
              ple, @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}-u@{ub} @{b}-r@{ub} is equivalent to @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}-r@{ub}  because  bare
              @{b}-r@{ub} overrides @{b}-u@{ub}.

       @{b}-f@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              forces  a  deposit;  the  new revision is deposited
              even it is not different from the preceding one.

       @{b}-k@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              searches the working file  for  keyword  values  to
              determine   its  revision  number,  creation  date,
              state, and author (see @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}),  and  assigns  these
              values  to the deposited revision, rather than com-
              puting them locally.  It also generates  a  default
              login  message  noting  the login of the caller and
              the actual checkin date.  This option is useful for
              software  distribution.  A revision that is sent to
              several sites should be  checked  in  with  the  @{b}-k@{ub}
              option at these sites to preserve the original num-
              ber, date, author, and state.  The  extracted  key-
              word  values  and  the  default  log message can be
              overridden with the options @{b}-d@{ub}, @{b}-m@{ub}, @{b}-s@{ub}, @{b}-w@{ub}, and any
              option that carries a revision number.

       @{b}-q@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              quiet  mode;  diagnostic  output is not printed.  A
              revision that is not different from  the  preceding
              one is not deposited, unless @{b}-f@{ub} is given.

       @{b}-i@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              initial  checkin;  report  an error if the RCS file
              already exists.  This  avoids  race  conditions  in
              certain applications.

       @{b}-j@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              just checkin and do not initialize; report an error
              if the RCS file does not already exist.

       @{b}-I@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              interactive mode; the user is  prompted  and  ques-
              tioned  even  if the standard input is not a termi-
              nal.

       @{b}-d@{ub}[@{u}date@{uu}]
              uses @{u}date@{uu} for the checkin date and time.  The  @{u}date@{uu}
              is  specified in free format as explained in @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}.
              This is useful for lying about  the  checkin  date,
              and  for  @{b}-k@{ub}  if  no date is available.  If @{u}date@{uu} is
              empty, the working file's time of last modification
              is used.

       @{b}-M@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Set  the  modification time on any new working file
              to be the date  of  the  retrieved  revision.   For
              example, @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}-d@{ub} @{b}-M@{ub} @{b}-u@{ub} @{u}f@{uu} does not alter @{u}f@{uu}'s modifica-
              tion time, even if @{u}f@{uu}'s contents change due to  key-
              word  substitution.   Use this option with care; it
              can confuse @{b}@{i}make@{ui}@{ub}.

       @{b}-m@{u}msg@{ub}@{uu}  uses the string @{u}msg@{uu} as  the  log  message  for  all
              revisions  checked in.  By convention, log messages
              that start with @{b}#@{ub} are comments and are  ignored  by
              programs  like  GNU  Emacs's @{b}vc@{ub} package.  Also, log
              messages that start with @{b}{@{u}clumpname}@{ub}@{uu}  (followed  by
              white  space)  are  meant to be clumped together if
              possible, even if they are associated with  differ-
              ent  files;  the @{b}{@{u}clumpname}@{ub}@{uu} label is used only for
              clumping, and is not considered to be part  of  the
              log message itself.

       @{b}-n@{u}name@{ub}@{uu} assigns the symbolic name @{u}name@{uu} to the number of the
              checked-in revision.  @{b}ci@{ub} prints an error message if
              @{u}name@{uu} is already assigned to another number.

       @{b}-N@{u}name@{ub}@{uu} same  as  @{b}-n@{ub},  except  that it overrides a previous
              assignment of @{u}name@{uu}.

       @{b}-s@{u}state@{ub}@{uu}
              sets the state of the checked-in  revision  to  the
              identifier @{u}state@{uu}.  The default state is @{b}Exp@{ub}.

       @{b}-t@{u}file@{ub}@{uu} writes  descriptive  text  from the contents of the
              named @{u}file@{uu} into the RCS file, deleting the existing
              text.  The @{u}file@{uu} cannot begin with @{b}-@{ub}.

       @{b}-t-@{u}string@{ub}@{uu}
              Write descriptive text from the @{u}string@{uu} into the RCS
              file, deleting the existing text.

              The @{b}-t@{ub} option, in both its forms, has  effect  only
              during  an  initial checkin; it is silently ignored
              otherwise.

              During the initial checkin, if @{b}-t@{ub} is not given,  @{b}ci@{ub}
              obtains the text from standard input, terminated by
              end-of-file or by a line  containing  @{b}.@{ub} by  itself.
              The user is prompted for the text if interaction is
              possible; see @{b}-I@{ub}.

              For backward compatibility with older  versions  of
              RCS, a bare @{b}-t@{ub} option is ignored.

       @{b}-T@{ub}     Set  the  RCS  file's  modification time to the new
              revision's time if the former precedes  the  latter
              and  there  is  a  new  revision;  preserve the RCS
              file's modification time otherwise.   If  you  have
              locked  a  revision,  @{b}ci@{ub}  usually  updates  the RCS
              file's  modification  time  to  the  current  time,
              because  the  lock  is  stored  in the RCS file and
              removing the lock requires changing the  RCS  file.
              This  can create an RCS file newer than the working
              file in one of two ways: first, @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}-M@{ub} can create  a
              working  file  with a date before the current time;
              second, when reverting to the previous revision the
              RCS  file can change while the working file remains
              unchanged.  These two  cases  can  cause  excessive
              recompilation caused by a @{b}@{i}make@{ui}@{ub} dependency of the
              working file  on  the  RCS  file.   The  @{b}-T@{ub}  option
              inhibits  this recompilation by lying about the RCS
              file's date.  Use this option  with  care;  it  can
              suppress  recompilation  even when a checkin of one
              working file should  affect  another  working  file
              associated  with  the  same RCS file.  For example,
              suppose the RCS file's time is 01:00, the (changed)
              working  file's  time  is 02:00, some other copy of
              the working file has a time of 03:00, and the  cur-
              rent  time  is  04:00.   Then @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}-d@{ub} @{b}-T@{ub} sets the RCS
              file's time to 02:00 instead of  the  usual  04:00;
              this causes @{b}@{i}make@{ui}@{ub} to think (incorrectly) that the
              other copy is newer than the RCS file.

       @{b}-w@{u}login@{ub}@{uu}
              uses @{u}login@{uu} for the author field  of  the  deposited
              revision.   Useful  for lying about the author, and
              for @{b}-k@{ub} if no author is available.

       @{b}-V@{ub}     Print RCS's version number.

       @{b}-V@{u}n@{ub}@{uu}    Emulate RCS version @{u}n@{uu}.  See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub} for details.

       @{b}-x@{u}suffixes@{ub}@{uu}
              specifies the suffixes for RCS files.   A  nonempty
              suffix  matches  any pathname ending in the suffix.
              An empty suffix matches any pathname  of  the  form
              @{b}RCS/@{u}path@{ub}@{uu}  or  @{u}path1@{b}/RCS/path2.@{ub}@{uu}   The  @{b}-x@{ub} option can
              specify a list of suffixes  separated  by  @{b}/@{ub}.   For
              example,  @{b}-x,v/@{ub}  specifies two suffixes: @{b},v@{ub} and the
              empty suffix.  If two or more suffixes  are  speci-
              fied,  they  are tried in order when looking for an
              RCS file; the first one that works is used for that
              file.   If no RCS file is found but an RCS file can
              be created, the suffixes  are  tried  in  order  to
              determine the new RCS file's name.  The default for
              @{u}suffixes@{uu} is installation-dependent; normally it  is
              @{b},v/@{ub} for hosts like Unix that permit commas in file-
              names, and is empty (i.e. just  the  empty  suffix)
              for other hosts.

       @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} specifies the date output format in keyword substi-
              tution, and specifies the  default  time  zone  for
              @{u}date@{uu}  in  the  @{b}-d@{u}date@{ub}@{uu}  option.   The @{u}zone@{uu} should be
              empty, a numeric UTC offset, or the special  string
              @{b}LT@{ub}  for  local time.  The default is an empty @{u}zone@{uu},
              which uses the traditional RCS format of UTC  with-
              out any time zone indication and with slashes sepa-
              rating the parts of the date; otherwise, times  are
              output  in  ISO  8601 format with time zone indica-
              tion.  For example, if local time  is  January  11,
              1990,  8pm  Pacific Standard Time, eight hours west
              of UTC, then the time is output as follows:

                     @{u}option@{uu}    @{u}time@{uu} @{u}output@{uu}
                     @{b}-z@{ub}        @{b}1990/01/12@{ub} @{b}04:00:00@{ub}        @{u}(default)@{uu}
                     @{b}-zLT@{ub}      @{b}1990-01-11@{ub} @{b}20:00:00-08@{ub}
                     @{b}-z+05:30@{ub}  @{b}1990-01-12@{ub} @{b}09:30:00+05:30@{ub}

              The @{b}-z@{ub} option does not affect dates stored  in  RCS
              files, which are always UTC.

@{b}FILE@{ub} @{b}NAMING@{ub}
       Pairs  of  RCS files and working files can be specified in
       three ways (see also the example section).

       1) Both the RCS file and the working file are given.   The
       RCS  pathname is of the form @{u}path1@{b}/workfileX@{ub}@{uu} and the work-
       ing pathname is of the form  @{u}path2@{b}/workfile@{ub}@{uu}  where  @{u}path1@{b}/@{ub}@{uu}
       and  @{u}path2@{b}/@{ub}@{uu} are (possibly different or empty) paths, @{u}work-@{uu}
       @{u}file@{uu} is a filename, and @{u}X@{uu} is  an  RCS  suffix.   If  @{u}X@{uu}  is
       empty,  @{u}path1@{b}/@{ub}@{uu} must start with @{b}RCS/@{ub} or must contain @{b}/RCS/@{ub}.

       2) Only the RCS file is given.  Then the working  file  is
       created  in  the current directory and its name is derived
       from the name of the RCS file by removing @{u}path1@{b}/@{ub}@{uu}  and  the
       suffix @{u}X@{uu}.

       3) Only the working file is given.  Then @{b}ci@{ub} considers each
       RCS suffix @{u}X@{uu} in turn, looking for an RCS file of the  form
       @{u}path2@{b}/RCS/workfileX@{ub}@{uu}  or  (if the former is not found and @{u}X@{uu}
       is nonempty) @{u}path2@{b}/workfileX.@{ub}@{uu}

       If the RCS file is specified without a path in 1) and  2),
       @{b}ci@{ub} looks for the RCS file first in the directory @{b}./RCS@{ub} and
       then in the current directory.

       @{b}ci@{ub} reports an error if an attempt  to  open  an  RCS  file
       fails  for an unusual reason, even if the RCS file's path-
       name is just one of several possibilities.   For  example,
       to suppress use of RCS commands in a directory @{u}d@{uu}, create a
       regular file named @{u}d@{b}/RCS@{ub}@{uu} so that casual  attempts  to  use
       RCS commands in @{u}d@{uu} fail because @{u}d@{b}/RCS@{ub}@{uu} is not a directory.

@{b}EXAMPLES@{ub}
       Suppose @{b},v@{ub} is an RCS suffix and the current directory con-
       tains a subdirectory @{b}RCS@{ub} with an RCS  file  @{b}io.c,v@{ub}.   Then
       each  of  the  following  commands check in a copy of @{b}io.c@{ub}
       into @{b}RCS/io.c,v@{ub} as the latest revision, removing @{b}io.c@{ub}.

              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}io.c;@{ub}    @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}RCS/io.c,v;@{ub}   @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}io.c,v;@{ub}
              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}io.c@{ub}  @{b}RCS/io.c,v;@{ub}    @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}io.c@{ub}  @{b}io.c,v;@{ub}
              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}RCS/io.c,v@{ub}  @{b}io.c;@{ub}    @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}io.c,v@{ub}  @{b}io.c;@{ub}

       Suppose instead that the empty suffix is an RCS suffix and
       the  current directory contains a subdirectory @{b}RCS@{ub} with an
       RCS file @{b}io.c@{ub}.  The each of the following commands  checks
       in a new revision.

              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}io.c;@{ub}    @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}RCS/io.c;@{ub}
              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}io.c@{ub}  @{b}RCS/io.c;@{ub}
              @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}RCS/io.c@{ub}  @{b}io.c;@{ub}

@{b}FILE@{ub} @{b}MODES@{ub}
       An  RCS  file  created by @{b}ci@{ub} inherits the read and execute
       permissions from the working file.  If the RCS file exists
       already,  @{b}ci@{ub}  preserves  its read and execute permissions.
       @{b}ci@{ub} always turns off all write permissions of RCS files.

@{b}FILES@{ub}
       Temporary files are created in  the  directory  containing
       the working file, and also in the temporary directory (see
       @{b}TMPDIR@{ub} under @{b}ENVIRONMENT@{ub}).  A semaphore file or files  are
       created  in the directory containing the RCS file.  With a
       nonempty suffix, the semaphore names begin with the  first
       character of the suffix; therefore, do not specify an suf-
       fix whose first character could be that of a working file-
       name.   With an empty suffix, the semaphore names end with
       @{b}_@{ub} so working filenames should not end in @{b}_@{ub}.

       @{b}ci@{ub} never changes an RCS or  working  file.   Normally,  @{b}ci@{ub}
       unlinks  the  file  and  creates a new one; but instead of
       breaking a chain of one or more symbolic links to  an  RCS
       file, it unlinks the destination file instead.  Therefore,
       @{b}ci@{ub} breaks any hard or symbolic links to any  working  file
       it  changes;  and hard links to RCS files are ineffective,
       but symbolic links to RCS files are preserved.

       The effective user must be able to search  and  write  the
       directory  containing  the  RCS  file.  Normally, the real
       user must be able to read the RCS and working files and to
       search  and  write  the  directory  containing the working
       file; however,  some  older  hosts  cannot  easily  switch
       between  real  and  effective users, so on these hosts the
       effective user is used for all  accesses.   The  effective
       user is the same as the real user unless your copies of @{b}ci@{ub}
       and @{b}co@{ub} have setuid privileges.  As described in  the  next
       section,  these  privileges  yield  extra  security if the
       effective user owns all RCS files and directories, and  if
       only the effective user can write RCS directories.

       Users  can control access to RCS files by setting the per-
       missions of the directory containing the files; only users
       with write access to the directory can use RCS commands to
       change its RCS files.  For example, in hosts that allow  a
       user  to  belong to several groups, one can make a group's
       RCS  directories  writable  to  that  group  only.    This
       approach suffices for informal projects, but it means that
       any group member can arbitrarily change  the  group's  RCS
       files, and can even remove them entirely.  Hence more for-
       mal projects sometimes distinguish between an RCS adminis-
       trator,  who  can  change the RCS files at will, and other
       project members, who can check in new revisions but cannot
       otherwise change the RCS files.

@{b}SETUID@{ub} @{b}USE@{ub}
       To prevent anybody but their RCS administrator from delet-
       ing revisions, a set of users can employ setuid privileges
       as follows.

        Check  that the host supports RCS setuid use.  Consult a
         trustworthy expert if there are any doubts.  It is  best
         if  the  @{b}seteuid@{ub} system call works as described in Posix
         1003.1a Draft 5, because RCS can switch back  and  forth
         easily  between  real  and  effective users, even if the
         real user is @{b}root@{ub}.  If not, the second best  is  if  the
         @{b}setuid@{ub}   system   call   supports   saved   setuid  (the
         {_POSIX_SAVED_IDS} behavior of Posix 1003.1-1990);  this
         fails  only  if  the real or effective user is @{b}root@{ub}.  If
         RCS detects any failure in setuid, it quits immediately.

        Choose  a  user  @{u}A@{uu} to serve as RCS administrator for the
         set of users.  Only @{u}A@{uu} can invoke the @{b}rcs@{ub} command on  the
         users'  RCS  files.   @{u}A@{uu}  should not be @{b}root@{ub} or any other
         user with special powers.  Mutually suspicious  sets  of
         users should use different administrators.

        Choose  a  pathname  @{u}B@{uu}  to be a directory of files to be
         executed by the users.

        Have @{u}A@{uu} set up @{u}B@{uu} to contain copies of @{b}ci@{ub} and @{b}co@{ub} that  are
         setuid  to @{u}A@{uu} by copying the commands from their standard
         installation directory @{u}D@{uu} as follows:

              @{b}mkdir@{ub}  @{u}B@{uu}
              @{b}cp@{ub}  @{u}D@{b}/c[io]@{ub}@{uu}  @{u}B@{uu}
              @{b}chmod@{ub}  @{b}go-w,u+s@{ub}  @{u}B@{b}/c[io]@{ub}@{uu}

        Have each user prepend @{u}B@{uu} to their path as follows:

              @{b}PATH=@{u}B:$PATH;@{ub}@{uu}  @{b}export@{ub}  @{b}PATH@{ub}  # ordinary shell
              @{b}set@{ub}  @{b}path=(@{u}B@{ub}@{uu}  @{b}$path)@{ub}  # C shell

        Have @{u}A@{uu} create each RCS directory  @{u}R@{uu}  with  write  access
         only to @{u}A@{uu} as follows:

              @{b}mkdir@{ub}  @{u}R@{uu}
              @{b}chmod@{ub}  @{b}go-w@{ub}  @{u}R@{uu}

        If  you  want  to  let  only  certain users read the RCS
         files, put the users into a group @{u}G@{uu}, and have @{u}A@{uu}  further
         protect the RCS directory as follows:

              @{b}chgrp@{ub}  @{u}G@{uu}  @{u}R@{uu}
              @{b}chmod@{ub}  @{b}g-w,o-rwx@{ub}  @{u}R@{uu}

        Have  @{u}A@{uu}  copy  old  RCS files (if any) into @{u}R@{uu}, to ensure
         that @{u}A@{uu} owns them.

        An RCS file's access list limits who can  check  in  and
         lock revisions.  The default access list is empty, which
         grants checkin access to anyone who  can  read  the  RCS
         file.   If  you want limit checkin access, have @{u}A@{uu} invoke
         @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-a@{ub}  on  the  file;  see  @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub}.    In   particular,
         @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-e@{ub} @{b}-a@{u}A@{ub}@{uu} limits access to just @{u}A@{uu}.

        Have  @{u}A@{uu}  initialize any new RCS files with @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-i@{ub} before
         initial checkin, adding the @{b}-a@{ub} option  if  you  want  to
         limit checkin access.

        Give  setuid privileges only to @{b}ci@{ub}, @{b}co@{ub}, and @{b}rcsclean@{ub}; do
         not give them to @{b}rcs@{ub} or to any other command.

        Do not use other setuid commands to invoke RCS commands;
         setuid is trickier than you think!

@{b}ENVIRONMENT@{ub}
       @{b}RCSINIT@{ub}
              options  prepended  to the argument list, separated
              by spaces.  A backslash escapes  spaces  within  an
              option.   The  @{b}RCSINIT@{ub} options are prepended to the
              argument  lists  of  most  RCS  commands.    Useful
              @{b}RCSINIT@{ub} options include @{b}-q@{ub}, @{b}-V@{ub}, @{b}-x@{ub}, and @{b}-z@{ub}.

       @{b}TMPDIR@{ub} Name  of  the temporary directory.  If not set, the
              environment variables @{b}TMP@{ub} and  @{b}TEMP@{ub}  are  inspected
              instead and the first value found is taken; if none
              of them are set, a host-dependent default is  used,
              typically @{b}/tmp@{ub}.

@{b}DIAGNOSTICS@{ub}
       For  each  revision,  @{b}ci@{ub}  prints the RCS file, the working
       file, and the number of both the deposited and the preced-
       ing  revision.  The exit status is zero if and only if all
       operations were successful.

@{b}NAME@{ub}
       co - check out RCS revisions

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}co@{ub} [@{u}options@{uu}] @{u}file@{uu} ...

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}co@{ub}  retrieves  a revision from each RCS file and stores it
       into the corresponding working file.

       Pathnames matching an RCS suffix  denote  RCS  files;  all
       others   denote   working  files.   Names  are  paired  as
       explained in @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.

       Revisions of an RCS file can  be  checked  out  locked  or
       unlocked.    Locking   a   revision  prevents  overlapping
       updates.  A revision checked out for reading or processing
       (e.g.,  compiling) need not be locked.  A revision checked
       out for editing and later checkin must normally be locked.
       Checkout  with locking fails if the revision to be checked
       out is currently locked by another user.  (A lock  can  be
       broken  with @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub}.)  Checkout with locking also requires
       the caller to be on the  access  list  of  the  RCS  file,
       unless  he  is  the owner of the file or the superuser, or
       the access list is empty.  Checkout without locking is not
       subject to accesslist restrictions, and is not affected by
       the presence of locks.

       A revision is selected by options for revision  or  branch
       number,  checkin  date/time,  author,  or state.  When the
       selection options are applied in combination, @{b}co@{ub} retrieves
       the  latest  revision that satisfies all of them.  If none
       of the selection options is specified,  @{b}co@{ub}  retrieves  the
       latest revision on the default branch (normally the trunk,
       see the @{b}-b@{ub} option of @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub}).  A revision or branch number
       can  be attached to any of the options @{b}-f@{ub}, @{b}-I@{ub}, @{b}-l@{ub}, @{b}-M@{ub}, @{b}-p@{ub},
       @{b}-q@{ub}, @{b}-r@{ub}, or @{b}-u@{ub}.  The options @{b}-d@{ub} (date), @{b}-s@{ub} (state), and  @{b}-w@{ub}
       (author)  retrieve  from  a  single  branch,  the @{u}selected@{uu}
       branch, which is either specified by one of @{b}-f@{ub},  ...,  @{b}-u@{ub},
       or the default branch.

       A @{b}co@{ub} command applied to an RCS file with no revisions cre-
       ates a zero-length working file.  @{b}co@{ub} always performs  key-
       word substitution (see below).

@{b}OPTIONS@{ub}
       @{b}-r@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              retrieves  the latest revision whose number is less
              than or equal to @{u}rev@{uu}.  If @{u}rev@{uu}  indicates  a  branch
              rather than a revision, the latest revision on that
              branch is retrieved.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is omitted, the latest
              revision  on  the default branch (see the @{b}-b@{ub} option
              of @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub}) is retrieved.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is  @{b}$@{ub},  @{b}co@{ub}  deter-
              mines  the  revision  number from keyword values in
              the working file.  Otherwise, a  revision  is  com-
              posed  of  one  or  more numeric or symbolic fields
              separated by periods.  If @{u}rev@{uu} begins with a period,
              then  the  default  branch  (normally the trunk) is
              prepended to it.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is a  branch  number  fol-
              lowed by a period, then the latest revision on that
              branch is used.  The numeric equivalent of  a  sym-
              bolic  field is specified with the @{b}-n@{ub} option of the
              commands @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub} and @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub}.

       @{b}-l@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              same as @{b}-r@{ub}, except that it also locks the retrieved
              revision for the caller.

       @{b}-u@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              same  as  @{b}-r@{ub},  except that it unlocks the retrieved
              revision if it was locked by the caller.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is
              omitted,  @{b}-u@{ub}  retrieves  the revision locked by the
              caller, if there is one;  otherwise,  it  retrieves
              the latest revision on the default branch.

       @{b}-f@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              forces  the overwriting of the working file; useful
              in connection with @{b}-q@{ub}.  See also FILE MODES  below.

       @{b}-kkv@{ub}   Generate  keyword  strings  using the default form,
              e.g. @{b}$Revision:@{ub} @{b}5.13@{ub} @{b}$@{ub} for the @{b}Revision@{ub} keyword.  A
              locker's  name  is  inserted  in  the  value of the
              @{b}Header@{ub}, @{b}Id@{ub}, and @{b}Locker@{ub} keyword strings  only  as  a
              file  is  being  locked,  i.e.  by @{b}ci@{ub} @{b}-l@{ub} and @{b}co@{ub} @{b}-l@{ub}.
              This is the default.

       @{b}-kkvl@{ub}  Like @{b}-kkv@{ub}, except that a locker's  name  is  always
              inserted if the given revision is currently locked.

       @{b}-kk@{ub}    Generate only keyword  names  in  keyword  strings;
              omit their values.  See KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION below.
              For example, for the @{b}Revision@{ub} keyword, generate the
              string  @{b}$Revision$@{ub}  instead  of  @{b}$Revision:@{ub} @{b}5.13@{ub} @{b}$@{ub}.
              This option is useful to ignore differences due  to
              keyword substitution when comparing different revi-
              sions of a file.  Log messages are  inserted  after
              @{b}$Log$@{ub} keywords even if @{b}-kk@{ub} is specified, since this
              tends to be more useful when merging changes.

       @{b}-ko@{ub}    Generate the old keyword  string,  present  in  the
              working  file  just  before it was checked in.  For
              example, for the  @{b}Revision@{ub}  keyword,  generate  the
              string  @{b}$Revision:@{ub} @{b}1.1@{ub} @{b}$@{ub} instead of @{b}$Revision:@{ub} @{b}5.13@{ub}
              @{b}$@{ub} if that is how the string appeared when the  file
              was  checked  in.  This can be useful for file for-
              mats that cannot tolerate any changes to substrings
              that happen to take the form of keyword strings.

       @{b}-kb@{ub}    Generate  a binary image of the old keyword string.
              This acts like @{b}-ko@{ub}, except it performs all  working
              file  input  and output in binary mode.  This makes
              little difference on Posix and Unix hosts,  but  on
              DOS-like  hosts  one  should use @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-i@{ub} @{b}-kb@{ub} to ini-
              tialize an RCS file intended to be used for  binary
              files.   Also,  on  all hosts, @{b}@{"rcsmerge" link RCSMERGE}@{ub} normally
              refuses to merge files when @{b}-kb@{ub} is in effect.

       @{b}-kv@{ub}    Generate only keyword values for  keyword  strings.
              For example, for the @{b}Revision@{ub} keyword, generate the
              string @{b}5.13@{ub} instead of @{b}$Revision:@{ub} @{b}5.13@{ub} @{b}$@{ub}.  This can
              help  generate files in programming languages where
              it  is  hard  to  strip  keyword  delimiters   like
              @{b}$Revision:@{ub} @{b}$@{ub}  from a string.  However, further key-
              word substitution cannot be performed once the key-
              word  names  are  removed, so this option should be
              used with care.  Because of this danger  of  losing
              keywords,  this  option cannot be combined with @{b}-l@{ub},
              and the owner write permission of the working  file
              is turned off; to edit the file later, check it out
              again without @{b}-kv@{ub}.

       @{b}-p@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              prints the retrieved revision on the standard  out-
              put  rather  than  storing  it in the working file.
              This option is useful when @{b}co@{ub} is part of a pipe.

       @{b}-q@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              quiet mode; diagnostics are not printed.

       @{b}-I@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              interactive mode; the user is  prompted  and  ques-
              tioned  even  if the standard input is not a termi-
              nal.

       @{b}-d@{u}date@{ub}@{uu} retrieves  the  latest  revision  on  the  selected
              branch  whose  checkin  date/time  is  less than or
              equal to @{u}date@{uu}.  The date and time can be  given  in
              free  format.   The  time  zone @{b}LT@{ub} stands for local
              time; other common time zone names are  understood.
              For  example, the following @{u}date@{uu}s are equivalent if
              local time is January 11, 1990, 8pm  Pacific  Stan-
              dard  Time, eight hours west of Coordinated Univer-
              sal Time (UTC):

              Most fields in the date and time can be  defaulted.
              The default time zone is normally UTC, but this can
              be overridden by the @{b}-z@{ub} option.  The other defaults
              are determined in the order year, month, day, hour,
              minute, and second (most to least significant).  At
              least  one  of  these fields must be provided.  For
              omitted fields that are of higher significance than
              the highest provided field, the time zone's current
              values are assumed.  For all other omitted  fields,
              the  lowest possible values are assumed.  For exam-
              ple, without @{b}-z@{ub}, the date  @{b}20,@{ub}  @{b}10:30@{ub}  defaults  to
              10:30:00  UTC  of  the  20th of the UTC time zone's
              current month and  year.   The  date/time  must  be
              quoted if it contains spaces.

       @{b}-M@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Set  the  modification time on the new working file
              to be the date of the retrieved revision.  Use this
              option with care; it can confuse @{b}@{i}make@{ui}@{ub}.

       @{b}-s@{u}state@{ub}@{uu}
              retrieves  the  latest  revision  on  the  selected
              branch whose state is set to @{u}state@{uu}.

       @{b}-T@{ub}     Preserve the modification time on the RCS file even
              if  the RCS file changes because a lock is added or
              removed.  This option can suppress extensive recom-
              pilation  caused  by  a  @{b}@{i}make@{ui}@{ub} dependency of some
              other copy of the working file  on  the  RCS  file.
              Use this option with care; it can suppress recompi-
              lation even when it is needed, i.e. when the change
              of  lock  would mean a change to keyword strings in
              the other working file.

       @{b}-w@{ub}[@{u}login@{uu}]
              retrieves  the  latest  revision  on  the  selected
              branch  which was checked in by the user with login
              name @{u}login@{uu}.  If the argument @{u}login@{uu} is omitted,  the
              caller's login is assumed.

       @{b}-j@{u}joinlist@{ub}@{uu}
              generates  a  new revision which is the join of the
              revisions on  @{u}joinlist@{uu}.   This  option  is  largely
              obsoleted  by @{b}@{"rcsmerge" link RCSMERGE}@{ub} but is retained for back-
              wards compatibility.

              The @{u}joinlist@{uu} is a comma-separated list of pairs  of
              the  form  @{u}rev2@{b}:rev3,@{ub}@{uu} where @{u}rev2@{uu} and @{u}rev3@{uu} are (sym-
              bolic or numeric) revision numbers.  For  the  ini-
              tial  such pair, @{u}rev1@{uu} denotes the revision selected
              by the above options @{b}-f@{ub}, ..., @{b}-w@{ub}.   For  all  other
              pairs,  @{u}rev1@{uu}  denotes the revision generated by the
              previous pair.   (Thus,  the  output  of  one  join
              becomes the input to the next.)

              For  each  pair,  @{b}co@{ub}  joins revisions @{u}rev1@{uu} and @{u}rev3@{uu}
              with respect to @{u}rev2@{uu}.  This means that all  changes
              that transform @{u}rev2@{uu} into @{u}rev1@{uu} are applied to a copy
              of @{u}rev3@{uu}.  This is particularly useful if  @{u}rev1@{uu}  and
              @{u}rev3@{uu} are the ends of two branches that have @{u}rev2@{uu} as
              a common ancestor.  If @{u}rev1@{uu}<@{u}rev2@{uu}<@{u}rev3@{uu} on  the  same
              branch,  joining  generates a new revision which is
              like @{u}rev3,@{uu} but with all changes that lead from @{u}rev1@{uu}
              to @{u}rev2@{uu} undone.  If changes from @{u}rev2@{uu} to @{u}rev1@{uu} over-
              lap with changes from  @{u}rev2@{uu}  to  @{u}rev3,@{uu}  @{b}co@{ub}  reports
              overlaps as described in @{b}@{"merge" link MERGE}@{ub}.

              For  the  initial  pair,  @{u}rev2@{uu} can be omitted.  The
              default is the common  ancestor.   If  any  of  the
              arguments  indicate  branches, the latest revisions
              on those branches are assumed.  The options @{b}-l@{ub}  and
              @{b}-u@{ub} lock or unlock @{u}rev1@{uu}.

       @{b}-V@{ub}     Print RCS's version number.

       @{b}-V@{u}n@{ub}@{uu}    Emulate  RCS  version @{u}n,@{uu} where @{u}n@{uu} can be @{b}3@{ub}, @{b}4@{ub}, or @{b}5@{ub}.
              This can be useful  when  interchanging  RCS  files
              with  others who are running older versions of RCS.
              To see which version of RCS your correspondents are
              running,  have  them invoke @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-V@{ub}; this works with
              newer versions of RCS.  If it  doesn't  work,  have
              them  invoke  @{b}rlog@{ub}  on  an RCS file; if none of the
              first  few  lines  of  output  contain  the  string
              @{b}branch:@{ub}  it  is version 3; if the dates' years have
              just two digits, it is version 4; otherwise, it  is
              version  5.   An RCS file generated while emulating
              version 3 loses its default branch.  An  RCS  revi-
              sion generated while emulating version 4 or earlier
              has a time stamp that is off by up to 13 hours.   A
              revision  extracted  while  emulating  version 4 or
              earlier contains  abbreviated  dates  of  the  form
              @{u}yy@{b}/mm/dd@{ub}@{uu} and can also contain different white space
              and line prefixes in the substitution for @{b}$Log$@{ub}.

       @{b}-x@{u}suffixes@{ub}@{uu}
              Use @{u}suffixes@{uu} to characterize RCS files.  See  @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}
              for details.

       @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} specifies the date output format in keyword substi-
              tution, and specifies the  default  time  zone  for
              @{u}date@{uu}  in  the  @{b}-d@{u}date@{ub}@{uu}  option.   The @{u}zone@{uu} should be
              empty, a numeric UTC offset, or the special  string
              @{b}LT@{ub}  for  local time.  The default is an empty @{u}zone@{uu},
              which uses the traditional RCS format of UTC  with-
              out any time zone indication and with slashes sepa-
              rating the parts of the date; otherwise, times  are
              output  in  ISO  8601 format with time zone indica-
              tion.  For example, if local time  is  January  11,
              1990,  8pm  Pacific Standard Time, eight hours west
              of UTC, then the time is output as follows:

                     @{u}option@{uu}    @{u}time@{uu} @{u}output@{uu}
                     @{b}-z@{ub}        @{b}1990/01/12@{ub} @{b}04:00:00@{ub}        @{u}(default)@{uu}
                     @{b}-zLT@{ub}      @{b}1990-01-11@{ub} @{b}20:00:00-08@{ub}
                     @{b}-z+05:30@{ub}  @{b}1990-01-12@{ub} @{b}09:30:00+05:30@{ub}

              The @{b}-z@{ub} option does not affect dates stored  in  RCS
              files, which are always UTC.

@{b}KEYWORD@{ub} @{b}SUBSTITUTION@{ub}
       Strings  of  the form @{b}$@{u}keyword$@{ub}@{uu} and @{b}$@{u}keyword:...$@{ub}@{uu} embedded
       in the text are replaced with strings of  the  form  @{b}$@{u}key-@{ub}@{uu}
       @{u}word@{b}:value$@{ub}@{uu}  where  @{u}keyword@{uu}  and  @{u}value@{uu}  are  pairs listed
       below.  Keywords can be embedded  in  literal  strings  or
       comments to identify a revision.

       Initially,  the user enters strings of the form @{b}$@{u}keyword$.@{ub}@{uu}
       On checkout, @{b}co@{ub} replaces these strings with strings of the
       form @{b}$@{u}keyword:value$.@{ub}@{uu}  If a revision containing strings of
       the latter form is checked back in, the value fields  will
       be  replaced  during the next checkout.  Thus, the keyword
       values are automatically updated on checkout.  This  auto-
       matic substitution can be modified by the @{b}-k@{ub} options.

       Keywords and their corresponding values:

       @{b}$Author$@{ub}
              The login name of the user who checked in the revi-
              sion.

       @{b}$Date$@{ub} The date and time  the  revision  was  checked  in.
              With @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} a numeric time zone offset is appended;
              otherwise, the date is UTC.

       @{b}$Header$@{ub}
              A standard header containing the full  pathname  of
              the  RCS  file,  the  revision number, the date and
              time, the author, the state,  and  the  locker  (if
              locked).  With @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} a numeric time zone offset is
              appended to the date; otherwise, the date is UTC.

       @{b}$Id$@{ub}   Same as @{b}$Header$@{ub}, except that the RCS  filename  is
              without a path.

       @{b}$Locker$@{ub}
              The  login name of the user who locked the revision
              (empty if not locked).

       @{b}$Log$@{ub}  The log message supplied during  checkin,  preceded
              by  a header containing the RCS filename, the revi-
              sion number, the author, and  the  date  and  time.
              With @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} a numeric time zone offset is appended;
              otherwise, the date is UTC.  Existing log  messages
              are  @{u}not@{uu} replaced.  Instead, the new log message is
              inserted after @{b}$Log:@{ub}...@{b}$@{ub}.  This is useful for accu-
              mulating a complete change log in a source file.

              Each  inserted  line is prefixed by the string that
              prefixes the @{b}$Log$@{ub} line.  For example, if the @{b}$Log$@{ub}
              line is "@{b}//@{ub} @{b}$Log:@{ub} @{b}tan.cc@{ub} @{b}$@{ub}", RCS prefixes each line
              of the log with "@{b}//@{ub} ".  This  is  useful  for  lan-
              guages  with  comments  that  go  to the end of the
              line.  The convention for other languages is to use
              a  "  @{b}*@{ub}  "  prefix inside a multiline comment.  For
              example, the initial log comment  of  a  C  program
              conventionally is of the following form:

                     @{b}/*@{ub}
                      @{b}*@{ub} @{b}$Log$@{ub}
                      @{b}*/@{ub}

              For  backwards compatibility with older versions of
              RCS, if the log prefix is @{b}/*@{ub} or  @{b}(*@{ub}  surrounded  by
              optional  white space, inserted log lines contain a
              space instead of @{b}/@{ub} or @{b}(@{ub};  however,  this  usage  is
              obsolescent and should not be relied on.

       @{b}$Name$@{ub} The  symbolic  name used to check out the revision,
              if   any.    For   example,   @{b}co@{ub} @{b}-rJoe@{ub}    generates
              @{b}$Name:@{ub} @{b}Joe@{ub} @{b}$@{ub}.  Plain @{b}co@{ub} generates just @{b}$Name:@{ub}  @{b}$@{ub}.

       @{b}$RCSfile$@{ub}
              The name of the RCS file without a path.

       @{b}$Revision$@{ub}
              The revision number assigned to the revision.

       @{b}$Source$@{ub}
              The full pathname of the RCS file.

       @{b}$State$@{ub}
              The  state  assigned  to  the  revision with the @{b}-s@{ub}
              option of @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub} or @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.

       The following characters in keyword values are represented
       by escape sequences to keep keyword strings well-formed.

              @{u}char@{uu}     @{u}escape@{uu} @{u}sequence@{uu}
              tab      @{b}\\t@{ub}
              newline  @{b}\\n@{ub}
              space    @{b}\\040@{ub}
              @{b}$@{ub}        @{b}\\044@{ub}
              @{b}\\@{ub}        @{b}\\\\@{ub}

@{b}FILE@{ub} @{b}MODES@{ub}
       The working file inherits the read and execute permissions
       from the RCS file.  In addition, the owner  write  permis-
       sion  is  turned  on,  unless  @{b}-kv@{ub}  is  set or the file is
       checked out unlocked and locking is  set  to  strict  (see
       @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub}).

       If a file with the name of the working file exists already
       and has write permission, @{b}co@{ub} aborts the  checkout,  asking
       beforehand  if  possible.  If the existing working file is
       not writable or @{b}-f@{ub} is given, the working file  is  deleted
       without asking.

@{b}FILES@{ub}
       @{b}co@{ub}  accesses files much as @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub} does, except that it does
       not need to read the working file unless a revision number
       of @{b}$@{ub} is specified.

@{b}ENVIRONMENT@{ub}
       @{b}RCSINIT@{ub}
              options  prepended  to the argument list, separated
              by spaces.  See @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub} for details.

@{b}DIAGNOSTICS@{ub}
       The RCS pathname, the working pathname, and  the  revision
       number  retrieved  are  written  to the diagnostic output.
       The exit status is zero if and only if all operations were
       successful.

@{b}LIMITS@{ub}
       Links to the RCS and working files are not preserved.

       There is no way to selectively suppress the  expansion  of
       keywords,  except  by  writing them differently.  In nroff
       and troff, this is done by embedding the null-character @{b}\\&@{ub}
       into the keyword.
@ENDNODE
@NODE IDENT "IDENT"


@{b}NAME@{ub}
       ident - identify RCS keyword strings in files

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}ident@{ub} [ @{b}-q@{ub} ] [ @{b}-V@{ub} ] [ @{u}file@{uu} ... ]

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}ident@{ub}   searches   for   all   instances  of  the  pattern
       @{b}$@{u}keyword:@{ub}@{uu} @{u}text@{uu} @{b}$@{ub} in the named files or, if  no  files  are
       named, the standard input.

       These  patterns are normally inserted automatically by the
       RCS command @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}, but can also be inserted manually.  The
       option  @{b}-q@{ub}  suppresses  the  warning given if there are no
       patterns in a file.  The option @{b}-V@{ub} prints @{b}ident@{ub}'s  version
       number.

       @{b}ident@{ub}  works  on  text  files  as well as object files and
       dumps.  For example, if the C program in @{b}f.c@{ub} contains

              @{b}#include@{ub} @{b}<stdio.h>@{ub}
              @{b}static@{ub} @{b}char@{ub} @{b}const@{ub} @{b}rcsid[]@{ub} @{b}=@{ub}
                @{b}"$Id:@{ub} @{b}f.c,v@{ub} @{b}5.4@{ub} @{b}1993/11/09@{ub}  @{b}17:40:15@{ub}  @{b}eggert@{ub}  @{b}Exp@{ub}
              @{b}$";@{ub}
              @{b}int@{ub} @{b}main()@{ub} @{b}{@{ub} @{b}return@{ub} @{b}printf("%s\\n",@{ub} @{b}rcsid)@{ub} @{b}==@{ub} @{b}EOF;@{ub} @{b}}@{ub}

       and @{b}f.c@{ub} is compiled into @{b}f.o@{ub}, then the command

              @{b}ident@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}  @{b}f.o@{ub}

       will output

              @{b}f.c:@{ub}
                  @{b}$Id:@{ub} @{b}f.c,v@{ub} @{b}5.4@{ub} @{b}1993/11/09@{ub} @{b}17:40:15@{ub} @{b}eggert@{ub} @{b}Exp@{ub} @{b}$@{ub}
              @{b}f.o:@{ub}
                  @{b}$Id:@{ub} @{b}f.c,v@{ub} @{b}5.4@{ub} @{b}1993/11/09@{ub} @{b}17:40:15@{ub} @{b}eggert@{ub} @{b}Exp@{ub} @{b}$@{ub}

       If a C program defines a string like @{b}rcsid@{ub} above but  does
       not  use  it,  @{b}@{i}lint@{ui}@{ub}  may complain, and some C compilers
       will optimize away the string.  The most reliable solution
       is  to  have the program use the @{b}rcsid@{ub} string, as shown in
       the example above.

       @{b}ident@{ub} finds all instances of the @{b}$@{u}keyword:@{ub}@{uu} @{u}text@{uu} @{b}$@{ub} pattern,
       even  if @{u}keyword@{uu} is not actually an RCS-supported keyword.
       This gives you information about nonstandard keywords like
       @{b}$XConsortium$@{ub}.

@{b}KEYWORDS@{ub}
       Here  is  the  list  of  keywords  currently maintained by
       @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}.  All times are given in Coordinated Universal  Time
       (UTC,  sometimes  called GMT) by default, but if the files
       were checked out with @{b}co@{ub}'s @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} option, times are  given
       with a numeric time zone indication appended.

       @{b}$Author$@{ub}
              The login name of the user who checked in the revi-
              sion.

       @{b}$Date$@{ub} The date and time the revision was checked in.

       @{b}$Header$@{ub}
              A standard header containing the full  pathname  of
              the  RCS  file,  the  revision number, the date and
              time, the author, the state,  and  the  locker  (if
              locked).

       @{b}$Id$@{ub}   Same  as  @{b}$Header$@{ub}, except that the RCS filename is
              without a path.

       @{b}$Locker$@{ub}
              The login name of the user who locked the  revision
              (empty if not locked).

       @{b}$Log$@{ub}  The  log  message  supplied  during  checkin.   For
              @{b}ident@{ub}'s purposes, this is equivalent to  @{b}$RCSfile$@{ub}.

       @{b}$Name$@{ub} The  symbolic  name used to check out the revision,
              if any.

       @{b}$RCSfile$@{ub}
              The name of the RCS file without a path.

       @{b}$Revision$@{ub}
              The revision number assigned to the revision.

       @{b}$Source$@{ub}
              The full pathname of the RCS file.

       @{b}$State$@{ub}
              The state assigned to  the  revision  with  the  @{b}-s@{ub}
              option of @{b}@{"rcs" link RCS}@{ub} or @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.

       @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}  represents the following characters in keyword val-
       ues by escape sequences  to  keep  keyword  strings  well-
       formed.

              @{u}char@{uu}     @{u}escape@{uu} @{u}sequence@{uu}
              tab      @{b}\\t@{ub}

@ENDNODE
@NODE MERGE "MERGE"


@{b}NAME@{ub}
       merge - three-way file merge

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}merge@{ub} [ @{u}options@{uu} ] @{u}file1@{uu} @{u}file2@{uu} @{u}file3@{uu}

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}merge@{ub}  incorporates  all  changes  that lead from @{u}file2@{uu} to
       @{u}file3@{uu} into @{u}file1@{uu}.  The result ordinarily goes into  @{u}file1@{uu}.
       @{b}merge@{ub} is useful for combining separate changes to an orig-
       inal.  Suppose @{u}file2@{uu} is the original, and both  @{u}file1@{uu}  and
       @{u}file3@{uu}  are  modifications  of  @{u}file2@{uu}.  Then @{b}merge@{ub} combines
       both changes.

       A conflict occurs if both @{u}file1@{uu} and @{u}file3@{uu} have changes  in
       a  common segment of lines.  If a conflict is found, @{b}merge@{ub}
       normally outputs a warning and brackets the conflict  with
       @{b}<<<<<<<@{ub}  and  @{b}>>>>>>>@{ub} lines.  A typical conflict will look
       like this:

              @{b}<<<<<<<@{ub} @{u}file@{uu} @{u}A@{uu}
              @{u}lines@{uu} @{u}in@{uu} @{u}file@{uu} @{u}A@{uu}
              @{b}=======@{ub}
              @{u}lines@{uu} @{u}in@{uu} @{u}file@{uu} @{u}B@{uu}
              @{b}>>>>>>>@{ub} @{u}file@{uu} @{u}B@{uu}

       If there are conflicts, the user should  edit  the  result
       and delete one of the alternatives.

@{b}OPTIONS@{ub}
       @{b}-A@{ub}     Output conflicts using the @{b}-A@{ub} style of @{b}@{i}diff3@{ui}@{ub}, if
              supported by @{b}diff3@{ub}.  This merges all changes  lead-
              ing  from  @{u}file2@{uu} to @{u}file3@{uu} into @{u}file1@{uu}, and generates
              the most verbose output.

       @{b}-E@{ub}, @{b}-e@{ub} These options specify conflict styles that generate
              less   information   than  @{b}-A@{ub}.   See  @{b}@{i}diff3@{ui}@{ub}  for
              details.  The default is @{b}-E@{ub}.  With @{b}-e@{ub},  @{b}merge@{ub}  does
              not warn about conflicts.

       @{b}-L@{ub} @{u}label@{uu}
              This  option  may  be  given up to three times, and
              specifies labels to be used in place of the  corre-
              sponding  file names in conflict reports.  That is,
              @{b}merge@{ub} @{b}-L@{ub} @{b}x@{ub} @{b}-L@{ub} @{b}y@{ub} @{b}-L@{ub} @{b}z@{ub} @{b}a@{ub} @{b}b@{ub} @{b}c@{ub}  generates  output  that
              looks like it came from files @{b}x@{ub}, @{b}y@{ub} and @{b}z@{ub} instead of
              from files @{b}a@{ub}, @{b}b@{ub} and @{b}c@{ub}.

       @{b}-p@{ub}     Send results to standard output  instead  of  over-
              writing @{u}file1@{uu}.

       @{b}-q@{ub}     Quiet;  do  not  warn about conflicts.  @{b}-V@{ub} Print 's
              version number.

@{b}DIAGNOSTICS@{ub}
       Exit status is 0 for no conflicts, 1 for some conflicts, 2
       for trouble.

@{b}NAME@{ub}
       rcs - change RCS file attributes

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}rcs@{ub} @{u}options@{uu} @{u}file@{uu} ...

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}rcs@{ub}  creates new RCS files or changes attributes of exist-
       ing ones.  An RCS  file  contains  multiple  revisions  of
       text,  an access list, a change log, descriptive text, and
       some control attributes.  For @{b}rcs@{ub} to  work,  the  caller's
       login  name  must  be  on  the  access list, except if the
       access list is empty, the caller is the owner of the  file
       or the superuser, or the @{b}-i@{ub} option is present.

       Pathnames  matching  an  RCS  suffix denote RCS files; all
       others  denote  working  files.   Names  are   paired   as
       explained  in  @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.   Revision  numbers  use  the syntax
       described in @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.

@{b}OPTIONS@{ub}
       @{b}-i@{ub}     Create and initialize a new RCS file,  but  do  not
              deposit  any revision.  If the RCS file has no path
              prefix, try to place it first into the subdirectory
              @{b}./RCS@{ub}, and then into the current directory.  If the
              RCS file already exists, print an error message.

       @{b}-a@{u}logins@{ub}@{uu}
              Append the login  names  appearing  in  the  comma-
              separated list @{u}logins@{uu} to the access list of the RCS
              file.

       @{b}-A@{u}oldfile@{ub}@{uu}
              Append the access list of  @{u}oldfile@{uu}  to  the  access
              list of the RCS file.

       @{b}-e@{ub}[@{u}logins@{uu}]
              Erase  the  login  names  appearing  in  the comma-
              separated list @{u}logins@{uu} from the access list  of  the
              RCS  file.   If @{u}logins@{uu} is omitted, erase the entire
              access list.

       @{b}-b@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Set the default branch to @{u}rev@{uu}.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is  omitted,
              the  default  branch  is reset to the (dynamically)
              highest branch on the trunk.

       @{b}-c@{u}string@{ub}@{uu}
              Set the comment leader to @{u}string@{uu}.  An  initial  @{b}ci@{ub},
              or an @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-i@{ub} without @{b}-c@{ub}, guesses the comment leader
              from the suffix of the working filename.

              This option is obsolescent, since RCS normally uses
              the  preceding  @{b}$Log$@{ub}  line's prefix when inserting
              log lines during checkout  (see  @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}).   However,
              older  versions  of  RCS  use  the  comment  leader
              instead of the @{b}$Log$@{ub} line's prefix, so if you  plan
              to  access a file with both old and new versions of
              RCS, make sure its comment leader matches its @{b}$Log$@{ub}
              line prefix.

       @{b}-k@{u}subst@{ub}@{uu}
              Set the default keyword substitution to @{u}subst@{uu}.  The
              effect of  keyword  substitution  is  described  in
              @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}.   Giving  an explicit @{b}-k@{ub} option to @{b}co@{ub}, @{b}rcsd-@{ub}
              @{b}iff@{ub}, and @{b}rcsmerge@{ub} overrides this  default.   Beware
              @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-kv@{ub},  because  @{b}-kv@{ub}  is incompatible with @{b}co@{ub} @{b}-l@{ub}.
              Use @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-kkv@{ub} to restore the normal default  keyword
              substitution.

       @{b}-l@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Lock  the revision with number @{u}rev@{uu}.  If a branch is
              given, lock the latest revision on that branch.  If
              @{u}rev@{uu}  is  omitted,  lock  the latest revision on the
              default  branch.   Locking   prevents   overlapping
              changes.   If  someone else already holds the lock,
              the lock is broken as with @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-u@{ub} (see below).

       @{b}-u@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Unlock the revision with number @{u}rev@{uu}.  If  a  branch
              is  given,  unlock  the  latest  revision  on  that
              branch.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is omitted, remove the latest  lock
              held by the caller.  Normally, only the locker of a
              revision can unlock it.  Somebody else unlocking  a
              revision  breaks the lock.  This causes a mail mes-
              sage to be sent to the original locker.   The  mes-
              sage  contains  a  commentary  solicited  from  the
              breaker.  The commentary is terminated  by  end-of-
              file or by a line containing @{b}.@{ub} by itself.

       @{b}-L@{ub}     Set  locking  to @{u}strict@{uu}.  Strict locking means that
              the owner of an RCS file is not exempt from locking
              for  checkin.  This option should be used for files
              that are shared.

       @{b}-U@{ub}     Set  locking  to  non-strict.   Non-strict  locking
              means  that  the  owner  of  a file need not lock a
              revision for checkin.  This option  should  @{u}not@{uu}  be
              used  for  files  that are shared.  Whether default
              locking is strict  is  determined  by  your  system
              administrator, but it is normally strict.

       @{b}-m@{u}rev:msg@{ub}@{uu}
              Replace revision @{u}rev@{uu}'s log message with @{u}msg@{uu}.

       @{b}-M@{ub}     Do  not  send  mail  when  breaking somebody else's
              lock.  This option is not meant for casual use;  it
              is  meant  for  programs  that  warn users by other
              means, and invoke @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-u@{ub} only as a low-level  lock-
              breaking operation.

       @{b}-n@{u}name@{ub}@{uu}[@{b}:@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]]
              Associate the symbolic name @{u}name@{uu} with the branch or
              revision @{u}rev@{uu}.  Delete the symbolic name if  both  @{b}:@{ub}
              and @{u}rev@{uu} are omitted; otherwise, print an error mes-
              sage if @{u}name@{uu} is  already  associated  with  another
              number.   If @{u}rev@{uu} is symbolic, it is expanded before
              association.  A @{u}rev@{uu} consisting of a  branch  number
              followed by a @{b}.@{ub} stands for the current latest revi-
              sion in the branch.  A @{b}:@{ub} with an empty  @{u}rev@{uu}  stands
              for  the  current  latest  revision  on the default
              branch,   normally   the   trunk.    For   example,
              @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-n@{u}name:@{ub}@{uu} @{b}RCS/*@{ub}  associates @{u}name@{uu} with the current
              latest revision of all the named  RCS  files;  this
              contrasts  with @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-n@{u}name:$@{ub}@{uu} @{b}RCS/*@{ub} which associates
              @{u}name@{uu} with the revision numbers extracted from  key-
              word strings in the corresponding working files.

       @{b}-N@{u}name@{ub}@{uu}[@{b}:@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]]
              Act  like  @{b}-n@{ub}, except override any previous assign-
              ment of @{u}name@{uu}.

       @{b}-o@{u}range@{ub}@{uu}
              deletes ("outdates") the revisions given by  @{u}range@{uu}.
              A  range  consisting  of  a  single revision number
              means that  revision.   A  range  consisting  of  a
              branch  number  means  the  latest revision on that
              branch.  A range of the form @{u}rev1@{b}:rev2@{ub}@{uu} means  revi-
              sions  @{u}rev1@{uu}  to @{u}rev2@{uu} on the same branch, @{b}:@{u}rev@{ub}@{uu} means
              from the beginning of the branch containing @{u}rev@{uu}  up
              to  and including @{u}rev@{uu}, and @{u}rev@{b}:@{ub}@{uu} means from revision
              @{u}rev@{uu} to the end of the branch containing @{u}rev@{uu}.   None
              of  the  outdated  revisions  can  have branches or
              locks.

       @{b}-q@{ub}     Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

       @{b}-I@{ub}     Run interactively, even if the  standard  input  is
              not a terminal.

       @{b}-s@{u}state@{ub}@{uu}[@{b}:@{u}rev@{ub}@{uu}]
              Set  the  state  attribute  of  the revision @{u}rev@{uu} to
              @{u}state@{uu}.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is a branch number, assume the  lat-
              est  revision  on  that branch.  If @{u}rev@{uu} is omitted,
              assume the latest revision on the  default  branch.
              Any  identifier  is acceptable for @{u}state@{uu}.  A useful
              set of states is @{b}Exp@{ub} (for experimental), @{b}Stab@{ub}  (for
              stable), and @{b}Rel@{ub} (for released).  By default, @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}
              sets the state of a revision to @{b}Exp@{ub}.

       @{b}-t@{ub}[@{u}file@{uu}]
              Write descriptive text from  the  contents  of  the
              named @{u}file@{uu} into the RCS file, deleting the existing
              text.  The @{u}file@{uu} pathname cannot begin with  @{b}-@{ub}.   If
              @{u}file@{uu}  is  omitted,  obtain  the  text from standard
              input, terminated by end-of-file or by a line  con-
              taining @{b}.@{ub} by itself.  Prompt for the text if inter-
              action is possible; see @{b}-I@{ub}.  With  @{b}-i@{ub},  descriptive
              text is obtained even if @{b}-t@{ub} is not given.

       @{b}-t-@{u}string@{ub}@{uu}
              Write descriptive text from the @{u}string@{uu} into the RCS
              file, deleting the existing text.

       @{b}-T@{ub}     Preserve the modification  time  on  the  RCS  file
              unless a revision is removed.  This option can sup-
              press extensive recompilation caused by  a  @{b}@{i}make@{ui}@{ub}
              dependency  of some copy of the working file on the
              RCS file.  Use this option with care; it  can  sup-
              press  recompilation  even  when it is needed, i.e.
              when a change to the RCS file would mean  a  change
              to keyword strings in the working file.

       @{b}-V@{ub}     Print RCS's version number.

       @{b}-V@{u}n@{ub}@{uu}    Emulate RCS version @{u}n@{uu}.  See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub} for details.

       @{b}-x@{u}suffixes@{ub}@{uu}
              Use  @{u}suffixes@{uu} to characterize RCS files.  See @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}
              for details.

       @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} Use @{u}zone@{uu} as the default time zone.  This option has
              no  effect;  it  is  present for compatibility with
              other RCS commands.

       At least one explicit option must be given, to ensure com-
       patibility  with future planned extensions to the @{b}rcs@{ub} com-
       mand.

@{b}COMPATIBILITY@{ub}
       The @{b}-b@{u}rev@{ub}@{uu} option generates an  RCS  file  that  cannot  be
       parsed by RCS version 3 or earlier.

       The  @{b}-k@{u}subst@{ub}@{uu}  options  (except  @{b}-kkv@{ub}) generate an RCS file
       that cannot be parsed by RCS version 4 or earlier.

       Use @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-V@{u}n@{ub}@{uu} to make an RCS file acceptable to RCS  version
       @{u}n@{uu}  by discarding information that would confuse version @{u}n@{uu}.

       RCS version 5.5  and  earlier  does  not  support  the  @{b}-x@{ub}
       option, and requires a @{b},v@{ub} suffix on an RCS pathname.

@{b}FILES@{ub}
       @{b}rcs@{ub} accesses files much as @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub} does, except that it uses
       the effective user for all accesses, it does not write the
       working  file  or its directory, and it does not even read
       the working file unless a revision number of @{b}$@{ub}  is  speci-
       fied.

@{b}ENVIRONMENT@{ub}
       @{b}RCSINIT@{ub}
              options  prepended  to the argument list, separated
              by spaces.  See @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub} for details.

@{b}DIAGNOSTICS@{ub}
       The RCS pathname and the revisions outdated are written to
       the  diagnostic  output.   The  exit status is zero if and
       only if all operations were successful.

@{b}BUGS@{ub}
       A catastrophe (e.g. a system crash) can cause RCS to leave
       behind  a  semaphore file that causes later invocations of
       RCS to claim that the RCS file is in use.   To  fix  this,
       remove  the semaphore file.  A semaphore file's name typi-
       cally begins with @{b},@{ub} or ends with @{b}_@{ub}.

       The separator for revision ranges in the @{b}-o@{ub} option used to
       be  @{b}-@{ub}  instead of @{b}:@{ub}, but this leads to confusion when sym-
       bolic names contain @{b}-@{ub}.  For backwards compatibility @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-o@{ub}
       still  supports  the  old  @{b}-@{ub} separator, but it warns about
       this obsolete use.

       Symbolic names need not refer  to  existing  revisions  or
       branches.  For example, the @{b}-o@{ub} option does not remove sym-
       bolic names for the outdated revisions; you must use @{b}-n@{ub} to
       remove the names.

@{b}NAME@{ub}
       rcsclean - clean up working files

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}rcsclean@{ub} [@{u}options@{uu}] [ @{u}file@{uu} ... ]

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}rcsclean@{ub}  removes  files  that  are  not  being worked on.
       @{b}rcsclean@{ub} @{b}-u@{ub} also unlocks and removes files that are  being
       worked on but have not changed.

       For  each  @{u}file@{uu}  given, @{b}rcsclean@{ub} compares the working file
       and a revision in the corresponding RCS file.  If it finds
       a  difference,  it  does  nothing.   Otherwise,  it  first
       unlocks the revision if the @{b}-u@{ub} option is given,  and  then
       removes  the  working  file  unless  the  working  file is
       writable and the revision is locked.  It logs its  actions
       by  outputting the corresponding @{b}rcs@{ub} @{b}-u@{ub} and @{b}rm@{ub} @{b}-f@{ub} commands
       on the standard output.

       Files are paired as explained in @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.   If  no  @{u}file@{uu}  is
       given,  all  working  files  in  the current directory are
       cleaned.  Pathnames matching  an  RCS  suffix  denote  RCS
       files; all others denote working files.

       The  number  of  the revision to which the working file is
       compared may be attached to any of the options @{b}-n@{ub}, @{b}-q@{ub}, @{b}-r@{ub},
       or @{b}-u@{ub}.  If no revision number is specified, then if the @{b}-u@{ub}
       option is given and the caller has  one  revision  locked,
       @{b}rcsclean@{ub}  uses  that revision; otherwise @{b}rcsclean@{ub} uses the
       latest revision on the default branch, normally the  root.

       @{b}rcsclean@{ub}  is  useful  for @{b}clean@{ub} targets in makefiles.  See
       also @{b}rcs@{i}diff@{ui}@{ub}, which prints  out  the  differences,  and
       @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub},  which normally reverts to the previous revision if
       a file was not changed.

@{b}OPTIONS@{ub}
       @{b}-k@{u}subst@{ub}@{uu}
              Use @{u}subst@{uu} style keyword substitution when  retriev-
              ing  the  revision  for  comparison.  See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub} for
              details.

       @{b}-n@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Do not actually remove  any  files  or  unlock  any
              revisions.   Using  this  option will tell you what
              @{b}rcsclean@{ub} would do without actually doing it.

       @{b}-q@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Do not log the actions taken on standard output.

       @{b}-r@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              This option has no effect other than specifying the
              revision for comparison.

       @{b}-T@{ub}     Preserve the modification time on the RCS file even
              if the RCS file changes because a lock is  removed.
              This  option  can  suppress extensive recompilation
              caused by a @{b}@{i}make@{ui}@{ub} dependency of some  other  copy
              of  the  working  file  on  the RCS file.  Use this
              option with care;  it  can  suppress  recompilation
              even  when it is needed, i.e. when the lock removal
              would mean a change to keyword strings in the other
              working file.

       @{b}-u@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Unlock  the revision if it is locked and no differ-
              ence is found.

       @{b}-V@{ub}     Print RCS's version number.

       @{b}-V@{u}n@{ub}@{uu}    Emulate RCS version @{u}n@{uu}.  See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub} for details.

       @{b}-x@{u}suffixes@{ub}@{uu}
              Use @{u}suffixes@{uu} to characterize RCS files.  See  @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}
              for details.

       @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} Use @{u}zone@{uu} as the time zone for keyword substitution;
              see @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub} for details.

@{b}EXAMPLES@{ub}
              @{b}rcsclean@{ub}  @{b}*.c@{ub}  @{b}*.h@{ub}

       removes all working files ending in @{b}.c@{ub} or @{b}.h@{ub} that were not
       changed since their checkout.

              @{b}rcsclean@{ub}

       removes  all  working  files in the current directory that
       were not changed since their checkout.

@{b}FILES@{ub}

@{b}NAME@{ub}
       rcsdiff - compare RCS revisions

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}rcsdiff@{ub}  [ @{b}-k@{u}subst@{ub}@{uu} ] [ @{b}-q@{ub} ] [ @{b}-r@{u}rev1@{ub}@{uu} [ @{b}-r@{u}rev2@{ub}@{uu} ] ] [ @{b}-T@{ub} ] [
       @{b}-V@{ub}[@{u}n@{uu}] ] [ @{b}-x@{u}suffixes@{ub}@{uu} ] [ @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} ] [ @{u}diff@{uu}  @{u}options@{uu}  ]  @{u}file@{uu}
       @{u}...@{uu}

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}rcsdiff@{ub}  runs @{b}@{i}diff@{ui}@{ub} to compare two revisions of each RCS
       file given.

       Pathnames matching an RCS suffix  denote  RCS  files;  all
       others   denote   working  files.   Names  are  paired  as
       explained in @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.

       The option @{b}-q@{ub} suppresses diagnostic output.  Zero, one, or
       two  revisions  may  be  specified  with  @{b}-r@{ub}.   The option
       @{b}-k@{u}subst@{ub}@{uu} affects keyword substitution when extracting revi-
       sions, as described in @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}; for example, @{b}-kk@{ub} @{b}-r1.1@{ub} @{b}-r1.2@{ub}
       ignores differences in keyword values when comparing revi-
       sions  @{b}1.1@{ub}  and  @{b}1.2@{ub}.   To avoid excess output from locker
       name substitution, @{b}-kkvl@{ub} is assumed if  (1)  at  most  one
       revision  option  is given, (2) no @{b}-k@{ub} option is given, (3)
       @{b}-kkv@{ub} is the default  keyword  substitution,  and  (4)  the
       working file's mode would be produced by @{b}co@{ub} @{b}-l@{ub}.  See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}
       for details about @{b}-T@{ub},  @{b}-V@{ub},  @{b}-x@{ub}  and  @{b}-z@{ub}.   Otherwise,  all
       options  of  @{b}@{i}diff@{ui}@{ub}  that  apply  to  regular  files  are
       accepted, with the same meaning as for @{b}diff@{ub}.

       If both @{u}rev1@{uu} and @{u}rev2@{uu} are omitted,  @{b}rcsdiff@{ub}  compares  the
       latest  revision  on  the  default  branch (by default the
       trunk) with the  contents  of  the  corresponding  working
       file.   This  is  useful  for determining what you changed
       since the last checkin.

       If @{u}rev1@{uu} is given, but @{u}rev2@{uu} is  omitted,  @{b}rcsdiff@{ub}  compares
       revision  @{u}rev1@{uu}  of  the  RCS file with the contents of the
       corresponding working file.

       If both @{u}rev1@{uu} and @{u}rev2@{uu} are given,  @{b}rcsdiff@{ub}  compares  revi-
       sions @{u}rev1@{uu} and @{u}rev2@{uu} of the RCS file.

       Both  @{u}rev1@{uu}  and  @{u}rev2@{uu} may be given numerically or symboli-
       cally.

@{b}EXAMPLE@{ub}
       The command

               @{b}rcsdiff@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       compares the latest revision on the default branch of  the
       RCS file to the contents of the working file @{b}f.c@{ub}.

@{b}ENVIRONMENT@{ub}
       @{b}RCSINIT@{ub}
              options  prepended  to the argument list, separated
              by spaces.  See @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub} for details.

@{b}DIAGNOSTICS@{ub}
       Exit status is 0 for no differences during any comparison,
       1 for some differences, 2 for trouble.

@NODE RCSFREEZE "RCSFREEZE"


@{b}NAME@{ub}
       rcsfreeze  -  freeze a configuration of sources checked in
       under RCS

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}rcsfreeze@{ub} [@{u}name@{uu}]

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}rcsfreeze@{ub} assigns a symbolic revision number to a  set  of
       RCS files that form a valid configuration.

       The  idea  is  to run @{b}rcsfreeze@{ub} each time a new version is
       checked in.  A unique symbolic name (@{b}C_@{u}number,@{ub}@{uu} where  @{u}num-@{uu}
       @{u}ber@{uu}  is  increased  each  time  @{b}rcsfreeze@{ub}  is run) is then
       assigned to the most recent revision of each RCS  file  of
       the main trunk.

       An  optional  @{u}name@{uu}  argument to @{b}rcsfreeze@{ub} gives a symbolic
       name to the configuration.  The unique identifier is still
       generated  and  is  listed in the log file but it will not
       appear as part of the symbolic revision name in the actual
       RCS files.

       A log message is requested from the user for future refer-
       ence.

       The shell script works only on all RCS files at one  time.
       All  changed  files  must  be  checked  in  already.   Run
       @{u}@{"rcsclean" link RCSCLEAN}@{uu} first and see whether any  sources  remain  in
       the current directory.

@{b}BUGS@{ub}
       @{b}rcsfreeze@{ub}  does  not check whether any sources are checked
       out and modified.

       Although both source file names and  RCS  file  names  are
       accepted,  they are not paired as usual with RCS commands.

       Error checking is rudimentary.

       @{b}rcsfreeze@{ub} is just an optional example  shell  script,  and
       should  not  be  taken  too seriously.  See CVS for a more
       complete solution.
@ENDNODE
@NODE RCSMERGE "RCSMERGE"


@{b}NAME@{ub}
       rcsmerge - merge RCS revisions

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}rcsmerge@{ub} [@{u}options@{uu}] @{u}file@{uu}

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}rcsmerge@{ub} incorporates the changes between two revisions of
       an RCS file into the corresponding working file.

       Pathnames matching an RCS suffix  denote  RCS  files;  all
       others   denote   working  files.   Names  are  paired  as
       explained in @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.

       At least one revision must be specified with  one  of  the
       options  described  below,  usually @{b}-r@{ub}.  At most two revi-
       sions may be specified.  If only one  revision  is  speci-
       fied,  the latest revision on the default branch (normally
       the highest branch on the trunk) is assumed for the second
       revision.   Revisions may be specified numerically or sym-
       bolically.

       @{b}rcsmerge@{ub} prints a  warning  if  there  are  overlaps,  and
       delimits the overlapping regions as explained in @{b}@{"merge" link MERGE}@{ub}.
       The command is useful for  incorporating  changes  into  a
       checked-out revision.

@{b}OPTIONS@{ub}
       @{b}-A@{ub}     Output conflicts using the @{b}-A@{ub} style of @{b}@{i}diff3@{ui}@{ub}, if
              supported by @{b}diff3@{ub}.  This merges all changes  lead-
              ing  from  @{u}file2@{uu} to @{u}file3@{uu} into @{u}file1@{uu}, and generates
              the most verbose output.

       @{b}-E@{ub}, @{b}-e@{ub} These options specify conflict styles that generate
              less   information   than  @{b}-A@{ub}.   See  @{b}@{i}diff3@{ui}@{ub}  for
              details.  The default is  @{b}-E@{ub}.   With  @{b}-e@{ub},  @{b}rcsmerge@{ub}
              does not warn about conflicts.

       @{b}-k@{u}subst@{ub}@{uu}
              Use  @{u}subst@{uu}  style  keyword substitution.  See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}
              for details.  For example, @{b}-kk@{ub} @{b}-r1.1@{ub} @{b}-r1.2@{ub}  ignores
              differences  in  keyword  values  when  merging the
              changes from @{b}1.1@{ub} to @{b}1.2@{ub}.  It normally does not make
              sense  to  merge binary files as if they were text,
              so @{b}rcsmerge@{ub} refuses to merge files if @{b}-kb@{ub} expansion
              is used.

       @{b}-p@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Send the result to standard output instead of over-
              writing the working file.

       @{b}-q@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Run quietly; do not print diagnostics.

       @{b}-r@{ub}[@{u}rev@{uu}]
              Merge with respect to revision @{u}rev@{uu}.  Here an  empty
              @{u}rev@{uu}  stands  for the latest revision on the default
              branch, normally the head.

       @{b}-T@{ub}     This option has no effect; it is present  for  com-
              patibility with other RCS commands.

       @{b}-V@{ub}     Print RCS's version number.

       @{b}-V@{u}n@{ub}@{uu}    Emulate RCS version @{u}n@{uu}.  See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub} for details.

       @{b}-x@{u}suffixes@{ub}@{uu}
              Use  @{u}suffixes@{uu} to characterize RCS files.  See @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}
              for details.

       @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} Use @{u}zone@{uu} as the time zone for keyword substitution.
              See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub} for details.

@{b}EXAMPLES@{ub}
       Suppose  you  have  released  revision 2.8 of @{b}f.c@{ub}.  Assume
       furthermore that after you complete an unreleased revision
       3.4, you receive updates to release 2.8 from someone else.
       To combine the updates to 2.8 and your changes between 2.8
       and 3.4, put the updates to 2.8 into file f.c and execute

           @{b}rcsmerge@{ub}  @{b}-p@{ub}  @{b}-r2.8@{ub}  @{b}-r3.4@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}  @{b}>f.merged.c@{ub}

       Then  examine  @{b}f.merged.c@{ub}.   Alternatively, if you want to
       save the updates to 2.8 in the RCS file, check them in  as
       revision 2.8.1.1 and execute @{b}co@{ub} @{b}-j@{ub}:

           @{b}ci@{ub}  @{b}-r2.8.1.1@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}
           @{b}co@{ub}  @{b}-r3.4@{ub}  @{b}-j2.8:2.8.1.1@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       As  another  example,  the  following  command  undoes the
       changes between revision 2.4 and  2.8  in  your  currently
       checked out revision in @{b}f.c@{ub}.

           @{b}rcsmerge@{ub}  @{b}-r2.8@{ub}  @{b}-r2.4@{ub}  @{b}f.c@{ub}

       Note  the  order  of  the  arguments, and that @{b}f.c@{ub} will be
       overwritten.

@{b}ENVIRONMENT@{ub}
       @{b}RCSINIT@{ub}
              options prepended to the argument  list,  separated

@{b}NAME@{ub}
       rlog  - print log messages and other information about RCS
       files

@{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}
       @{b}rlog@{ub} [ @{u}options@{uu} ] @{u}file@{uu} ...

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       @{b}rlog@{ub} prints information about RCS files.

       Pathnames matching an RCS suffix  denote  RCS  files;  all
       others   denote   working  files.   Names  are  paired  as
       explained in @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub}.

       @{b}rlog@{ub} prints the following information for each  RCS  file:
       RCS  pathname, working pathname, head (i.e., the number of
       the latest revision on the trunk), default branch,  access
       list, locks, symbolic names, suffix, total number of revi-
       sions, number of  revisions  selected  for  printing,  and
       descriptive  text.   This  is  followed by entries for the
       selected revisions in reverse chronological order for each
       branch.   For  each revision, @{b}rlog@{ub} prints revision number,
       author, date/time, state, number  of  lines  added/deleted
       (with  respect  to  the  previous revision), locker of the
       revision (if any), and log message.  All  times  are  dis-
       played  in  Coordinated  Universal  Time (UTC) by default;
       this can be overridden with  @{b}-z@{ub}.   Without  options,  @{b}rlog@{ub}
       prints  complete  information.  The options below restrict
       this output.

       @{b}-L@{ub}  Ignore RCS files that have no locks set.  This is con-
           venient in combination with @{b}-h@{ub}, @{b}-l@{ub}, and @{b}-R@{ub}.

       @{b}-R@{ub}  Print  only  the name of the RCS file.  This is conve-
           nient for translating a working pathname into  an  RCS
           pathname.

       @{b}-h@{ub}  Print  only  the RCS pathname, working pathname, head,
           default branch, access list,  locks,  symbolic  names,
           and suffix.

       @{b}-t@{ub}  Print the same as @{b}-h@{ub}, plus the descriptive text.

       @{b}-N@{ub}  Do not print the symbolic names.

       @{b}-b@{ub}  Print  information  about the revisions on the default
           branch, normally the highest branch on the trunk.

       @{b}-d@{u}dates@{ub}@{uu}
           Print  information  about  revisions  with  a  checkin
           date/time  in  the  ranges  given  by  the  semicolon-
           separated list of @{u}dates@{uu}.  A range of the form @{u}d1@{b}<d2@{ub}@{uu} or
           @{u}d2@{b}>d1@{ub}@{uu}   selects  the  revisions  that  were  deposited
           between @{u}d1@{uu} and @{u}d2@{uu} exclusive.  A range of the  form  @{b}<@{u}d@{ub}@{uu}
           or  @{u}d@{b}>@{ub}@{uu}  selects all revisions earlier than @{u}d@{uu}.  A range
           of the form @{u}d@{b}<@{ub}@{uu} or @{b}>@{u}d@{ub}@{uu} selects all revisions dated later
           than  @{u}d@{uu}.   If  @{b}<@{ub} or @{b}>@{ub} is followed by @{b}=@{ub} then the ranges
           are inclusive, not exclusive.  A range of the  form  @{u}d@{uu}
           selects  the  single,  latest revision dated @{u}d@{uu} or ear-
           lier.  The date/time strings @{u}d@{uu}, @{u}d1@{uu}, and @{u}d2@{uu} are in  the
           free  format  explained in @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}.  Quoting is normally
           necessary, especially for @{b}<@{ub} and @{b}>@{ub}.  Note that the sep-
           arator is a semicolon.

       @{b}-l@{ub}[@{u}lockers@{uu}]
           Print  information  about  locked  revisions only.  In
           addition, if the comma-separated list @{u}lockers@{uu} of login
           names is given, ignore all locks other than those held
           by the @{u}lockers@{uu}.  For  example,  @{b}rlog@{ub} @{b}-L@{ub} @{b}-R@{ub} @{b}-lwft@{ub} @{b}RCS/*@{ub}
           prints the name of RCS files locked by the user @{b}wft@{ub}.

       @{b}-r@{ub}[@{u}revisions@{uu}]
           prints information about revisions given in the comma-
           separated list @{u}revisions@{uu} of revisions and  ranges.   A
           range  @{u}rev1@{b}:rev2@{ub}@{uu}  means  revisions @{u}rev1@{uu} to @{u}rev2@{uu} on the
           same branch, @{b}:@{u}rev@{ub}@{uu} means revisions from  the  beginning
           of  the branch up to and including @{u}rev@{uu}, and @{u}rev@{b}:@{ub}@{uu} means
           revisions starting with @{u}rev@{uu} to the end of  the  branch
           containing  @{u}rev@{uu}.   An  argument that is a branch means
           all revisions on that branch.   A  range  of  branches
           means  all revisions on the branches in that range.  A
           branch followed by a @{b}.@{ub} means the  latest  revision  in
           that  branch.   A  bare @{b}-r@{ub} with no @{u}revisions@{uu} means the
           latest revision on the default  branch,  normally  the
           trunk.

       @{b}-s@{u}states@{ub}@{uu}
           prints   information   about   revisions  whose  state
           attributes match one of the states given in the comma-
           separated list @{u}states@{uu}.

       @{b}-w@{ub}[@{u}logins@{uu}]
           prints information about revisions checked in by users
           with login names appearing in the comma-separated list
           @{u}logins@{uu}.   If  @{u}logins@{uu}  is  omitted, the user's login is
           assumed.

       @{b}-T@{ub}  This option has no effect; it is present for  compati-
           bility with other RCS commands.

       @{b}-V@{ub}  Print RCS's version number.

       @{b}-V@{u}n@{ub}@{uu} Emulate RCS version @{u}n@{uu} when generating logs.  See @{b}@{"co" link CO}@{ub}
           for more.

       @{b}-x@{u}suffixes@{ub}@{uu}
           Use @{u}suffixes@{uu} to characterize RCS files.  See @{b}@{"ci" link CI}@{ub} for
           details.

       @{b}rlog@{ub}  prints  the  intersection  of the revisions selected
       with the options @{b}-d@{ub}, @{b}-l@{ub}, @{b}-s@{ub}, and @{b}-w@{ub}, intersected with  the
       union of the revisions selected by @{b}-b@{ub} and @{b}-r@{ub}.

       @{b}-z@{u}zone@{ub}@{uu} specifies the date output format, and specifies the
              default time zone for @{u}date@{uu} in the  @{b}-d@{u}dates@{ub}@{uu}  option.
              The  @{u}zone@{uu} should be empty, a numeric UTC offset, or
              the special string @{b}LT@{ub} for local time.  The  default
              is  an  empty  @{u}zone@{uu}, which uses the traditional RCS
              format of UTC without any time zone indication  and
              with slashes separating the parts of the date; oth-
              erwise, times are output in ISO  8601  format  with
              time  zone  indication.  For example, if local time
              is January 11, 1990,  8pm  Pacific  Standard  Time,
              eight hours west of UTC, then the time is output as
              follows:

                     @{u}option@{uu}    @{u}time@{uu} @{u}output@{uu}
                     @{b}-z@{ub}        @{b}1990/01/12@{ub} @{b}04:00:00@{ub}        @{u}(default)@{uu}
                     @{b}-zLT@{ub}      @{b}1990-01-11@{ub} @{b}20:00:00-08@{ub}
                     @{b}-z+05:30@{ub}  @{b}1990-01-12@{ub} @{b}09:30:00+05:30@{ub}

           @{b}rlog@{ub}  @{b}RCS/*@{ub}

       The first command prints the names of all RCS files in the
       subdirectory  @{b}RCS@{ub}  that  have  locks.   The second command
       prints the headers of those files, and  the  third  prints
       the headers plus the log messages of the locked revisions.
       The last command prints complete information.

@{b}BUGS@{ub}
       The separator for revision ranges in the @{b}-r@{ub} option used to
       be  @{b}-@{ub}  instead of @{b}:@{ub}, but this leads to confusion when sym-
       bolic names contain @{b}-@{ub}.  For backwards  compatibility  @{b}rlog@{ub}
       @{b}-r@{ub}  still supports the old @{b}-@{ub} separator, but it warns about
       this obsolete use.

@{b}NAME@{ub}
       rcsfile - format of RCS file

@{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}
       An RCS file's contents are described by the grammar below.

       The text is free format: space, backspace,  tab,  newline,
       vertical  tab,  form  feed,  and  carriage return (collec-
       tively,  @{u}white@{uu}  @{u}space@{uu})  have  no  significance  except  in
       strings.  However, white space cannot appear within an id,
       num, or sym, and an RCS file must end with a newline.

       Strings are enclosed by @{b}@@{ub}.  If a string contains a  @{b}@@{ub},  it
       must  be doubled; otherwise, strings can contain arbitrary
       binary data.

       The meta syntax uses the following conventions: `|'  (bar)
       separates  alternatives;  `{'  and  `}'  enclose  optional
       phrases; `{' and `}*' enclose phrases that can be repeated
       zero or more times; `{' and '}+' enclose phrases that must
       appear at least once and can be repeated; Terminal symbols
       are in @{b}boldface@{ub}; nonterminal symbols are in @{u}italics@{uu}.

       @{u}rcstext@{uu}   ::=  @{u}admin@{uu} {@{u}delta@{uu}}* @{u}desc@{uu} {@{u}deltatext@{uu}}*

       @{u}idchar@{uu}    ::=  any visible graphic character except @{u}special@{uu}

       @{u}special@{uu}   ::=  @{b}$@{ub} | @{b},@{ub} | @{b}.@{ub} | @{b}:@{ub} | @{b};@{ub} | @{b}@@{ub}

       @{u}string@{uu}    ::=  @{b}@@{ub}{any character, with @{b}@@{ub} doubled}*@{b}@@{ub}

       @{u}newphrase@{uu} ::=  @{u}id@{uu} @{u}word@{uu}* @{b};@{ub}

       @{u}word@{uu}      ::=  @{u}id@{uu} | @{u}num@{uu} | @{u}string@{uu} | @{b}:@{ub}

       Identifiers  are  case  sensitive.   Keywords are in lower
       case only.  The sets of keywords and identifiers can over-
       lap.   In most environments RCS uses the ISO 8859/1 encod-
       ing: visible graphic  characters  are  codes  041-176  and
       240-377,  and white space characters are codes 010-015 and
       040.

       Dates, which appear after the @{b}date@{ub}  keyword,  are  of  the
       form  @{u}Y@{b}.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss@{ub}@{uu},  where @{u}Y@{uu} is the year, @{u}mm@{uu} the month
       (01-12), @{u}dd@{uu} the day (01-31), @{u}hh@{uu} the hour (00-23),  @{u}mm@{uu}  the
       minute  (00-59),  and  @{u}ss@{uu}  the second (00-60).  @{u}Y@{uu} contains
       just the last two digits of the year for years  from  1900
       through  1999,  and  all  the  digits of years thereafter.
       Dates use the Gregorian calendar; times use UTC.

       The @{u}newphrase@{uu} productions in the grammar are reserved  for
       future  extensions  to  the  format of RCS files.  No @{u}new-@{uu}
       @{u}phrase@{uu} will begin with any keyword already in use.

       The @{u}delta@{uu} nodes form a tree.  All nodes whose numbers con-
       sist  of a single pair (e.g., 2.3, 2.1, 1.3, etc.)  are on
       the trunk, and are linked through the @{b}next@{ub} field in  order
       of  decreasing  numbers.  The @{b}head@{ub} field in the @{u}admin@{uu} node
       points to the head of that sequence  (i.e.,  contains  the
       highest  pair).   The  @{b}branch@{ub} node in the admin node indi-
       cates the default branch (or revision) for most RCS opera-
       tions.  If empty, the default branch is the highest branch
       on the trunk.

       All @{u}delta@{uu} nodes whose numbers consist of 2@{u}n@{uu} fields  (@{u}n@{uu}>=2)
       (e.g.,  3.1.1.1,  2.1.2.2,  etc.)   are linked as follows.
       All nodes whose first 2@{u}n@{uu}-1 number fields are identical are
       linked  through the @{b}next@{ub} field in order of increasing num-
       bers.  For each such sequence, the @{u}delta@{uu} node whose number
       is identical to the first 2@{u}n@{uu}-2 number fields of the deltas
       on that sequence is called the branchpoint.  The  @{b}branches@{ub}
       field  of  a  node  contains  a list of the numbers of the
       first nodes of all sequences for which  it  is  a  branch-
       point.  This list is ordered in increasing numbers.

       The  following  diagram  shows an example of an RCS file's
       organization.
