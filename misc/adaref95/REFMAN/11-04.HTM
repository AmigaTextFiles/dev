<h2><a name="0">11.4 Exception Handling</a>
 -- <a href="toc11-04.htm">TOC</a>
</h2>
<dl><dt><a name="1">(1)</a><dd>When an exception occurrence is raised, normal program execution is
abandoned and control is transferred to an applicable exception_handler, if
any.  To handle an exception occurrence is to respond to the exceptional
event.  To propagate an exception occurrence is to raise it again in another
context; that is, to fail to respond to the exceptional event in the present
context.
</dl><h5 align="center">Dynamic Semantics</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="2">(2)</a><dd>Within a given task, if the execution of construct a is defined by this
International Standard to consist (in part) of the execution of construct b,
then while b is executing, the execution of a is said to dynamically enclose
the execution of b.  The innermost dynamically enclosing execution of a given
execution is the dynamically enclosing execution that started most recently.
<dt><a name="3">(3)</a><dd>When an exception occurrence is raised by the execution of a given
construct, the rest of the execution of that construct is abandoned; that is,
any portions of the execution that have not yet taken place are not
performed.  The construct is first completed, and then left, as explained in
<a href="07-06-01.htm">7.6.1</a>.  Then:
<dt><a name="4">(4)</a><dd><ul><li>If the construct is a task_body, the exception does not propagate
further;
</ul><dt><a name="5">(5)</a><dd><ul><li>If the construct is the sequence_of_statements of a handled_sequence_of_statements that has a handler with a choice covering
the exception, the occurrence is handled by that handler;
</ul><dt><a name="6">(6)</a><dd><ul><li>Otherwise, the occurrence is propagated to the innermost
dynamically enclosing execution, which means that the occurrence
is raised again in that context.
</ul><dt><a name="7">(7)</a><dd>When an occurrence is handled by a given handler, the choice_parameter_specification, if any, is first elaborated, which creates the choice
parameter and initializes it to the occurrence.  Then, the sequence_of_statements of the handler is executed; this execution replaces the abandoned
portion of the execution of the sequence_of_statements.
<p><dt><dd><ul>NOTES</ul>
<dt><a name="8">(8)</a><dd><ul>(1) Note that exceptions raised in a declarative_part of a body are not
handled by the handlers of the handled_sequence_of_statements of that
body.
