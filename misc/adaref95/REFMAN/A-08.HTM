<h5 align="center">Static Semantics</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="1">(1)</a><dd>Two kinds of access to external files are defined in this subclause:
sequential access and direct access.  The corresponding file types and the
associated operations are provided by the generic packages Sequential_IO and
Direct_IO. A file object to be used for sequential access is called a
sequential file, and one to be used for direct access is called a direct
file.  Access to stream files is described <a href="A-12-01.htm">in A.12.1</a>.
<dt><a name="2">(2)</a><dd>For sequential access, the file is viewed as a sequence of values that
are transferred in the order of their appearance (as produced by the program
or by the external environment).  When the file is opened with mode In_File
or Out_File, transfer starts respectively from or to the beginning of the
file.  When the file is opened with mode Append_File, transfer to the file
starts after the last element of the file.
<dt><a name="3">(3)</a><dd>For direct access, the file is viewed as a set of elements occupying
consecutive positions in linear order; a value can be transferred to or from
an element of the file at any selected position.  The position of an element
is specified by its index, which is a number, greater than zero, of the
implementation-defined integer type Count.  The first element, if any, has
index one; the index of the last element, if any, is called the current size;
the current size is zero if there are no elements.  The current size is a
property of the external file.
<dt><a name="4">(4)</a><dd>An open direct file has a current index, which is the index that will be
used by the next read or write operation.  When a direct file is opened, the
current index is set to one.  The current index of a direct file is a
property of a file object, not of an external file.
