<h2><a name="0">11.6 Exceptions and Optimization</a></h2>
<dl><dt><a name="1">(1)</a><dd>This clause gives permission to the implementation to perform certain
``optimizations'' that do not necessarily preserve the canonical semantics.
</dl><h5 align="center">Dynamic Semantics</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="2">(2)</a><dd>The rest of this International Standard (outside this clause) defines the
canonical semantics of the language.  The canonical semantics of a given
(legal) program determines a set of possible external effects that can result
from the execution of the program with given inputs.
<dt><a name="3">(3)</a><dd>As explained <a href="01-01-03.htm">in 1.1.3</a>, ``Conformity of an Implementation With the
Standard'', the external effect of a program is defined in terms of its
interactions with its external environment.  Hence, the implementation can
perform any internal actions whatsoever, in any order or in parallel, so long
as the external effect of the execution of the program is one that is allowed
by the canonical semantics, or by the rules of this clause.
</dl><h5 align="center">Implementation Permissions</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="4">(4)</a><dd>The following additional permissions are granted to the implementation:
<dt><a name="5">(5)</a><dd><ul><li>An implementation need not always raise an exception when a
language-defined check fails.  Instead, the operation that failed
the check can simply yield an undefined result.  The exception
need be raised by the implementation only if, in the absence of
raising it, the value of this undefined result would have some
effect on the external interactions of the program.  In
determining this, the implementation shall not presume that an
undefined result has a value that belongs to its subtype, nor
even to the base range of its type, if scalar.  Having removed
the raise of the exception, the canonical semantics will in
general allow the implementation to omit the code for the check,
and some or all of the operation itself.
</ul><dt><a name="6">(6)</a><dd><ul><li>If an exception is raised due to the failure of a
language-defined check, then upon reaching the corresponding
exception_handler (or the termination of the task, if none), the
external interactions that have occurred need reflect only that
the exception was raised somewhere within the execution of the
sequence_of_statements with the handler (or the task_body),
possibly earlier (or later if the interactions are independent of
the result of the checked operation) than that defined by the
canonical semantics, but not within the execution of some
abort-deferred operation or independent subprogram that does not
dynamically enclose the execution of the construct whose check
failed.  An independent subprogram is one that is defined outside
the library unit containing the construct whose check failed, and
has no Inline pragma applied to it.  Any assignment that occurred
outside of such abort-deferred operations or independent
subprograms can be disrupted by the raising of the exception,
causing the object or its parts to become abnormal, and certain
subsequent uses of the object to be erroneous, as explained in
<a href="13-09-01.htm">13.9.1</a>.
</ul><p><dt><dd><ul>NOTES</ul>
<dt><a name="7">(7)</a><dd><ul>(3) The permissions granted by this clause can have an effect on the
semantics of a program only if the program fails a language-defined
check.
</ul></dl><p>
