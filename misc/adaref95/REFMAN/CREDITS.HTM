Who had the idea that the Ada 95 RM should be transmogrified (by students)
into HTML. I liked the idea and one day started to transmogrify.

Who kindly showed me the PERL scripts he used for the HTML'ization
of LRM 83. Since the textual structure of LRM 95 is different from
that of LRM 83, and since I designed a different hypertext structure
for the reference manual, I got some ideas but unfortunately no reuse
was possible.

<h3> How It Was Done </h3>

This hypertext Ada 95 RM was generated by passing the
ASCII RM through several PERL scripts which annotated
the text with HTML markup. The PERL scripts were written
by <a href="author.htm">Magnus Kempe</a>, on his own
time.
