<h1>HTML-Hypertext
<br>Ada 95 Reference Manual</h1>

<h2>Author: Magnus Kempe</h2>

In addition to being the author of the
<em>HTML hypertext annotations</em> for the Ada 95 RM,
I am a lecturer at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne
(the EPFL), teaching programming methods--with Ada. My area of research
is in the foundations of software engineering methods. I am pursuing a
Ph.D. in Software Engineering with the following working title:
"The Premises of Software Engineering Methods: Analysis and
Recommendations."  I am an active member of the Swiss delegation
to the Ada working group of ISO (done working on Ada 9X, the
revision of Ada); I am also chairman of "Ada in Switzerland".
I've given tutorials at international conferences such as OOPSLA,
TRI-Ada, and TOOLS Europe.
<p>

I am a member of the Society for Objective Science (SOS), of the ACM,
of ACM/SIGAda, of IEEE, and of the IEEE Computer Society.<p>

My project file says: "My thesis, teaching Ada, Aristotelian philosophy,
and living on earth."  I love Kira, my cat; I'm a rabid bookworm; and
I know that <b>A is A</b>.  I am a radical for reason.<p>

I speak French, English, Swedish, and German (in that order), and
understand a few related European languages.  I spent 8 years studying
Latin. (So if you write to me, pick an appropriate language!)<p>

I love chocolate (brown, dark, praliné--esp. Ragusa), dark chocolate chip
ice cream, and chocolate mousse.  (Restaurant favori à Lausanne:
La Grappe d'Or, en partie pour son chariot des desserts.)<p>

In some of my spare time, I manage the
<a href="http://lglwww.epfl.ch/Ada/"><img src="/Ada/Pictures/la-icon.gif" alt="">Ada WWW Server (Home of the Brave Ada Programmers)</a>
and I am the author/compiler of the
<a href="http://lglwww.epfl.ch/Ada/FAQ/">Ada FAQs</a>.
