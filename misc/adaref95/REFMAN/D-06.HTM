<h2><a name="0">D.6 Preemptive Abort</a></h2>
<dl><dt><a name="1">(1)</a><dd>This clause specifies requirements on the immediacy with which an aborted
construct is completed.
</dl><h5 align="center">Dynamic Semantics</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="2">(2)</a><dd>On a system with a single processor, an aborted construct is completed
immediately at the first point that is outside the execution of an
abort-deferred operation.
</dl><h5 align="center">Documentation Requirements</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="3">(3)</a><dd>On a multiprocessor, the implementation shall document any conditions
that cause the completion of an aborted construct to be delayed later than
what is specified for a single processor.
</dl><h5 align="center">Metrics</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="4">(4)</a><dd>The implementation shall document the following metrics:
<dt><a name="5">(5)</a><dd><ul><li>The execution time, in processor clock cycles, that it takes for
an abort_statement to cause the completion of the aborted task.
This is measured in a situation where a task T2 preempts task T1
and aborts T1.  T1 does not have any finalization code.  T2 shall
verify that T1 has terminated, by means of the Terminated
attribute.
</ul><dt><a name="6">(6)</a><dd><ul><li>On a multiprocessor, an upper bound in seconds, on the time that
the completion of an aborted task can be delayed beyond the point
that it is required for a single processor.
</ul><dt><a name="7">(7)</a><dd><ul><li>An upper bound on the execution time of an asynchronous_select,
in processor clock cycles.  This is measured between a point
immediately before a task T1 executes a protected operation
Pr.Set that makes the condition of an entry_barrier Pr.Wait true,
and the point where task T2 resumes execution immediately after
an entry call to Pr.Wait in an asynchronous_select.  T1 preempts
T2 while T2 is executing the abortable part, and then blocks
itself so that T2 can execute.  The execution time of T1 is
measured separately, and subtracted.
</ul><dt><a name="8">(8)</a><dd><ul><li>An upper bound on the execution time of an asynchronous_select,
in the case that no asynchronous transfer of control takes place.
This is measured between a point immediately before a task
executes the asynchronous_select with a nonnull abortable part,
and the point where the task continues execution immediately
after it.  The execution time of the abortable part is
subtracted.
</ul></dl><h5 align="center">Implementation Advice</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="9">(9)</a><dd>Even though the abort_statement is included in the list of potentially
blocking operations <a href="09-05-01.htm">(see 9.5.1)</a>, it is recommended that this statement be
implemented in a way that never requires the task executing the abort_statement to block.
<dt><a name="10">(10)</a><dd>On a multi-processor, the delay associated with aborting a task on
another processor should be bounded; the implementation should use periodic
polling, if necessary, to achieve this.
<p><dt><dd><ul>NOTES</ul>
<dt><a name="11">(11)</a><dd><ul>(27) Abortion does not change the active or base priority of the aborted
task.
</ul><dt><a name="12">(12)</a><dd><ul>(28) Abortion cannot be more immediate than is allowed by the rules for
deferral of abortion during finalization and in protected actions.
</ul></dl><p>
