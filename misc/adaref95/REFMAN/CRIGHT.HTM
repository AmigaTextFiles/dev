<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION</h3>

The "Ada 95 HTML-Hypertext Reference Manual," hereafter referred to as
the "package", is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
<p>

This package may be freely copied and distributed, if accompanied by
this statement, and provided that integral copies of all files are
included (i.e. no change whatsoever is allowed). You are asked to help
keep the hypertext annotations consistent, identical everywhere in the
world.  If you think something needs to be modified, tell me what and
why (see my e-mail address below).
<p>

Copies of the package are allowed but not recommended on other
anonymous FTP sites.  Copies are NOT allowed on government-subsidized
FTP/WWW sites which require registration and accounts.  This package
is intended exclusively for local installation; individual files
extracted from the package may NOT be exported outside of a site
(e.g. company or university) with FTP/WWW servers other than the
Home of the Brave Ada Programmers (HBAP).
<p>

You may not sell these hypertext annotations but you may include
and use them in an application. There are no royalties for such uses
of the annotations; I only ask that any documentation acknowledge
that it includes or uses the hypertext annotations developed by me.
If you would like to generate a different format of hypertext markup,
I'll gladly share the PERL scripts I have written, under the
condition that proper credit be given (to obtain these scripts,
send me e-mail, explaining the particulars of what you intend to do).
<p>

<h3>NO WARRANTY</h3>

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THIS PACKAGE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER PROVIDES THE PACKAGE "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
<p>
IN NO EVENT WILL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PACKAGE (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PACKAGE TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<p>

<h3>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
