<h1>HTML-Hypertext
<br>Ada 9X Reference Manual </h1>

<h2> User's Guide </h2>

This hypertext document is a transmogrified version of the Ada 95
Reference Manual. All cross-references (to clauses, paragraphs,
etc.) in the text and index have become links which will take you
to the appropriate parts when followed.
<p>

<h3><a name="navigation">Navigation</a></h3>

Whenever you see a sequence of words <a href="#topics">like this
example</a>, you are in presence of a link which you may follow (what
these words look like and how to follow a link is specific to your WWW
browser). Normally, the links are named in such a way that you know
where they go. (The example link in this paragraph takes you to the
list of topics above.) Your WWW broser should let you backtrack through
the "pages" you came from, so that links are not one-way tracks only.


<h3><a name="format">Format of the Hyper-RM95</a></h3>

The text of the reference manual is formatted and all paragraphs are
numbered in order to reflect the structure of the paper version. The
presentation will of course slightly differ from that of the paper
version, first because some formatting information has been lost in the
process of going from Scribe to ASCII to HTML, and second because your
WWW browser provides you with a particular, possibly quite limited,
view of this document.
<p>

The reference manual has been subdivided into hypertext "pages,"
one page for each section, annex, clause, and subclause. This
guarantees that when you access a new page you will not wait
forever to download and display it.
<p>

A few icons are used in this document:
<img src="la-icon.gif" alt="ICON"> is an icon of Lady Ada
Lovelace, which stands for a link to the Ada WWW Server
<a href="http://lglwww.epfl.ch/Ada/">(Home of the Brave Ada Programmers,
URL http://lglwww.epfl.ch/Ada/)</a> .
If you are accessing this document offline (i.e. without
Internet connection) you will not be able to follow this link.
The other icons are used for <a href="#structured">structured navigation</a>.


<h3><a name="toc">Table of Contents</a></h3>

There are three versions of the table of contents (TOC) of
the reference manual. They differ in how much they "zoom" in
the TOC: when you access the <a href="toc.htm">first page
of the hyper-RM95</a>, you will see the list of section and annex
headers only, while <a href="toc-l1.htm">zoom one (clauses)</a>
will show the TOC down to one level with all clause headers, and
<a href="toc-l2.htm">zoom two (subclauses)</a> will show the
TOC down to two levels with all subclause headers.
The link names to the three TOC levels are systematically abbreviated
with patterns reflecting the numbering of
<a href="toc.htm">sections (TOC --)</a>,
<a href="toc-l1.htm">clauses (--.--)</a>, and
<a href="toc-l2.htm">subclauses (--.--.--)</a>.
<p>

To navigate within a section or annex, the corresponding table of
contents is included (with links to clauses and subclauses, if any)
at the end of the page.  Similarly, within each clause, a table of
contents includes links to its subclauses, if any.
Good examples are <a href="01.htm">section 1, "General"</a>
and <a href="01-01.htm">clause 1.1, "Scope of the Standard."</a>
<p>

In addition, whenever a section or clause needs a local TOC, there is
an associated TOC page which simply contains the title of the section
or clause and its local TOC (see for instance
<a href="01.htm">section 1, "General"</a>
and the associated
<a href="toc01.htm">TOC of section 1, "General"</a>).
Thus the titles of sections and clauses listed in each TOC are links to
the corresponding text, and these titles are followed by an additional
link to their corresponding local TOC, if any.
This should prove quite helpful for those who have little screen estate
and do not wish to scroll pages in order to reach local TOCs.
Good examples are the <a href="toc04.htm">TOC of section 4, "Names
and Expressions"</a> and <a href="toc04-01.htm">TOC of clause 4.1,
"Names."</a>
<p>

If you are familiar with the Ada 83 RM, you might have noticed
a change of terminology in this description. ISO requires
that the first-level subdivisions of a standard be called
"sections," the second-level subdivisions "clauses," and the
third-level "subclauses." (In LRM 83. those were respectively
called "chapters," "sections," and "subsections.")


<h3><a name="index">Index</a></h3>

The <a href="index.htm">index of the reference manual</a> has
been subdivided into sections by alphabetical order. All entries
are links to the corresponding paragraphs of the document.
<p>


<h3><a name="structured">Structured Navigation</a></h3>

On all pages of this document (sections, annexes, clauses, and
subclauses), you will find some links at the top and bottom,
separated by bars. They provide a structure for systematic
navigation in the reference manual:<br>
Prev | Up | Next | Back | Forward
<br>
TOC -- / --.-- / --.--.-- | Index | Search | Syntax | Help
<p>

If you are using a graphical browser, you will see the following
equivalent menu:<br>
<img src="left.gif" alt="arrow left"> | <img src="up.gif" alt="arrow up"> | <img src="right.gif" alt="arrow right"> | <img src="back.gif" alt="arrow back"> | <img src="forward.gif" alt="arrow forward">
<br>
TOC -- / --.-- / --.--.-- | Index | Search | Syntax | Help
<p>

The five links on the first line are "directional" links.
The first three ("Prev," "Up," and "Next") will only appear when
appropriate, and the next two ("Back" and "Forward") are always available.
They are described in detail below.
<p>

The others, on the second line, have the following functions:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="toc.htm">TOC --</a> opens the table of contents (no zoom).
<li>
<a href="toc-l1.htm">--.--</a> opens the table of contents at the clause level.
<li>
<a href="toc-l2.htm">--.--.--</a> opens the table of contents at the subclause level.
<li>
<a href="index.htm">Index</a> opens the index.
<li>
<a href="#search">Search</a> opens the search page, for direct access to the numbered contents of the reference manual.
<li>
<a href="syntax.htm">Syntax</a> opens access to the syntax
summaries of the language; one lists the syntax rules in their order of
appearance, each rule being linked to its point of origin, the other is
a cross reference of all non-terminals.
<li>
"Help" opens the page you are reading now.
</ul>
<p>

<img src="left.gif" alt="Prev"> is a link to the <em>previous</em>
section, annex, clause, or subclause, depending on where you are and if
there is a previous one.
<p>
For instance, <img src="left.gif" alt="Prev">
in <a href="03.htm">section 3, "Declarations and Types,"</a> is a
link to <a href="02.htm">section 2, "Lexical Elements,"</a> and in
<a href="12-05-02.htm">subclause 12.5.2, "Formal Scalar Types,"</a>
it is a link to <a href="12-05-01.htm">subclause 12.5.1, "Formal
Private and Derived Types."</a>
<p>
If there is no previous section, clause, or subclause, the link is inactive
and looks like this: <img src="noleft.gif" alt="____">.
<p>

<img src="right.gif" alt="Next"> is a link to the <em>next</em>
section, annex, clause, or subclause, depending on where you are and if
there is a next one.
<p>
For instance, <img src="right.gif" alt="Next">
in <a href="03.htm">section 3, "Declarations and Types,"</a> is a
link to <a href="04.htm">section 4, "Names and Expression,"</a> and
in <a href="12-05-02.htm">subclause 12.5.2, "Formal Scalar
Types,"</a> it is a link to <a href="12-05-03.htm">subclause
12.5.3, "Formal Array Types."</a>
<p>
If there is no next section, clause, or subclause, the link is inactive
and looks like this: <img src="noright.gif" alt="____">.
<p>

<img src="up.gif" alt="Up"> is a link to the <em>enclosing</em>
section, annex, or clause, depending on where you are.  In sections
and annexes, it is a link to the global table of contents.
<p>
For instance, <img src="up.gif" alt="Up"> in
<a href="03.htm">section 3, "Declarations and Types,"</a> is a
link to the <a href="toc.htm">TOC --</a> but in
<a href="12-05-02.htm">subclause 12.5.2, "Formal Scalar Types,"</a>
it is a link to <a href="12-05.htm">clause 12.5, "Formal Types,"</a>
where it is a link to <a href="12.htm">section 12, "Generic Units."</a>
<p>

<img src="back.gif" alt="Back"> is a back link to the <em>previous page</em>, as if browsing some sort of paper version of the reference manual.
<p>
For instance, <img src="back.gif" alt="Back"> in
<a href="03.htm">section 3, "Declarations and Types,"</a> is a
link to <a href="02-09.htm">clause 2.9, "Reserved Words,"</a> and
in <a href="12-05-02.htm">subclause 12.5.2, "Formal Scalar
Types,"</a> it is a link to <a href="12-05-01.htm">subclause
12.5.1, "Formal Private and Derived Types,"</a> where it is a link to
<a href="12-05.htm">clause 12.5, "Formal Types,"</a> where it is a
link to <a href="12-04.htm">clause 12.4, "Formal Objects."</a>
<p>

<img src="forward.gif" alt="Forward"> is a forward link to the <em>next page</em>, achieving the inverse "paper version" effect of back links.
<p>
For instance, <img src="forward.gif" alt="Forward"> in
<a href="03.htm">section 3, "Declarations and Types,"</a> is a
link to <a href="03-01.htm">clause 3.1, "Declarations,"</a> and
in <a href="12-05-03.htm">subclause 12.5.3, "Formal Array
Types,"</a> it is a link to <a href="12-05-04.htm">subclause
12.5.4, "Formal Access Types,"</a> where it is a link to
<a href="12-06.htm">clause 12.6, "Formal Subprograms."</a>
<p>

<h3><a name="search">Direct Search</a></h3>

On all pages of this document (sections, annexes, clauses, and
subclauses), you will find a <a href="search.htm">Search</a>
link at the top and bottom.  It opens the search page, for direct
access to the numbered contents of the reference manual.
<p>
To access directly a specific section, clause, or subclause, just
type the section, clause, or subclause number that you want in the
entry box and then press the <kbd>Return</kbd> key on your keyboard.
With some browsers, you may have to place the pointer in the box
before you can enter any text.
<p>
You may even specify a paragraph number in parenthesis, e.g. '1', '1.1'
and '1(2)' are valid search keys.  If the section, clause, or subclause
specified does not exist, you will land in the table of contents.  If
the paragraph number specified does not exist, you will land at the top
or bottom (depending on your browser) of the section, clause, or subclause
you requested.
<p>
For direct composition of URL references into the reference manual, note
that the filenames are constructed as follows:
<ul>
<li>Sections and annexes in "X.htm" where X is a two-digit number
(e.g. "01") for a section and a single character (e.g. "A") for an annex.
<p>
<li>Clauses in "X-Y.htm" where Y is a two-digit number for the clause
in section/annex X (see above).
<p>
<li>Subclauses in "X-Y-Z.htm" where Z is a two-digit number for the
subclause in clause Y in section/annex X (see above).
<p>
<li>Add "#N" to the filename to directly access paragraph "N" in a section,
annex, clause, or subclause
(e.g. <a href="01.htm#2">"01.htm#2"</a>
for paragraph 2 in section 1).
<p>
<li>The corresponding local table of contents of a section, annex, or clause
has the prefix "toc-".
(e.g. <a href="toc01.htm">"toc-01.htm"</a>
for the TOC of section 1).
</ul>
