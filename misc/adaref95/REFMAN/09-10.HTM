<h2><a name="0">9.10 Shared Variables</a></h2>
<h5 align="center">Static Semantics</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="1">(1)</a><dd>If two different objects, including nonoverlapping parts of the same
object, are independently addressable, they can be manipulated concurrently
by two different tasks without synchronization.  Normally, any two
nonoverlapping objects are independently addressable.  However, if packing,
record layout, or Component_Size is specified for a given composite object,
then it is implementation defined whether or not two nonoverlapping parts of
that composite object are independently addressable.
</dl><h5 align="center">Dynamic Semantics</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="2">(2)</a><dd>Separate tasks normally proceed independently and concurrently with one
another.  However, task interactions can be used to synchronize the actions
of two or more tasks to allow, for example, meaningful communication by the
direct updating and reading of variables shared between the tasks.  The
actions of two different tasks are synchronized in this sense when an action
of one task signals an action of the other task; an action A1 is defined to
signal an action A2 under the following circumstances:
<dt><a name="3">(3)</a><dd><ul><li>If A1 and A2 are part of the execution of the same task, and the
language rules require A1 to be performed before A2;
</ul><dt><a name="4">(4)</a><dd><ul><li>If A1 is the action of an activator that initiates the activation
of a task, and A2 is part of the execution of the task that is
activated;
</ul><dt><a name="5">(5)</a><dd><ul><li>If A1 is part of the activation of a task, and A2 is the action
of waiting for completion of the activation;
</ul><dt><a name="6">(6)</a><dd><ul><li>If A1 is part of the execution of a task, and A2 is the action of
waiting for the termination of the task;
</ul><dt><a name="7">(7)</a><dd><ul><li>If A1 is the action of issuing an entry call, and A2 is part of
the corresponding execution of the appropriate entry_body or
accept_statement.
</ul><dt><a name="8">(8)</a><dd><ul><li>If A1 is part of the execution of an accept_statement or entry_body, and A2 is the action of returning from the corresponding
entry call;
</ul><dt><a name="9">(9)</a><dd><ul><li>If A1 is part of the execution of a protected procedure body or
entry_body for a given protected object, and A2 is part of a
later execution of an entry_body for the same protected object;
</ul><dt><a name="10">(10)</a><dd><ul><li>If A1 signals some action that in turn signals A2.
</ul></dl><h5 align="center">Erroneous Execution</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="11">(11)</a><dd>Given an action of assigning to an object, and an action of reading or
updating a part of the same object (or of a neighboring object if the two are
not independently addressable), then the execution of the actions is
erroneous unless the actions are sequential.  Two actions are sequential if
one of the following is true:
<dt><a name="12">(12)</a><dd><ul><li>One action signals the other;
</ul><dt><a name="13">(13)</a><dd><ul><li>Both actions occur as part of the execution of the same task;
</ul><dt><a name="14">(14)</a><dd><ul><li>Both actions occur as part of protected actions on the same
protected object, and at most one of the actions is part of a
call on a protected function of the protected object.
</ul><dt><a name="15">(15)</a><dd>A pragma Atomic or Atomic_Components may also be used to ensure that
certain reads and updates are sequential -- see <a href="C-06.htm">C.6</a>.
