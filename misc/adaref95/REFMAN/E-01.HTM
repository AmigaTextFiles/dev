<h2><a name="0">E.1 Partitions</a></h2>
<dl><dt><a name="1">(1)</a><dd>The partitions of a distributed program are classified as either active
or passive.
</dl><h5 align="center">Post-Compilation Rules</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="2">(2)</a><dd>An active partition is a partition as defined <a href="10-02.htm">in 10.2</a>. A passive
partition is a partition that has no thread of control of its own, whose
library units are all preelaborated, and whose data and subprograms are
accessible to one or more active partitions.
<dt><a name="3">(3)</a><dd>A passive partition shall include only library_items that either are
declared pure or are shared passive <a href="10-02-01.htm">(see 10.2.1</a> and <a href="E-02-01.htm">E.2.1)</a>.
<dt><a name="4">(4)</a><dd>An active partition shall be configured on a processing node.  A passive
partition shall be configured either on a storage node or on a processing
node.
<dt><a name="5">(5)</a><dd>The configuration of the partitions of a program onto a distributed
system shall be consistent with the possibility for data references or calls
between the partitions implied by their semantic dependences.  Any reference
to data or call of a subprogram across partitions is called a remote access.
</dl><h5 align="center">Dynamic Semantics</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="6">(6)</a><dd>A library_item is elaborated as part of the elaboration of each partition
that includes it.  If a normal library unit <a href="E-02.htm">(see E.2)</a> has state, then a
separate copy of the state exists in each active partition that elaborates
it.  The state evolves independently in each such partition.
<dt><a name="7">(7)</a><dd>An active partition terminates when its environment task terminates. A
partition becomes inaccessible if it terminates or if it is aborted. An
active partition is aborted when its environment task is aborted. In
addition, if a partition fails during its elaboration, it becomes
inaccessible to other partitions. Other implementation-defined events can
also result in a partition becoming inaccessible.
<dt><a name="8">(8)</a><dd>For a prefix D that denotes a library-level declaration, excepting a
declaration of or within a declared-pure library unit, the following
attribute is defined:
<dt><a name="9">(9)</a><dd>D'Partition_ID
<ul>Denotes a value of the type universal_integer that identifies
the partition in which D was elaborated.  If D denotes the
declaration of a remote call interface library unit <a href="E-02-03.htm">(see E.2.3)</a> the given partition is the one where the body of D was
elaborated.
</ul></dl><h5 align="center">Bounded (Run-Time) Errors</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="10">(10)</a><dd>It is a bounded error for there to be cyclic elaboration dependences
between the active partitions of a single distributed program.  The possible
effects are deadlock during elaboration, or the raising of Program_Error in
one or all of the active partitions involved.
</dl><h5 align="center">Implementation Permissions</h5>
<dl><dt><a name="11">(11)</a><dd>An implementation may allow multiple active or passive partitions to be
configured on a single processing node, and multiple passive partitions to be
configured on a single storage node.  In these cases, the scheduling
policies, treatment of priorities, and management of shared resources between
these partitions are implementation defined.
<dt><a name="12">(12)</a><dd>An implementation may allow separate copies of an active partition to be
configured on different processing nodes, and to provide appropriate
interactions between the copies to present a consistent state of the
partition to other active partitions.
<dt><a name="13">(13)</a><dd>In an implementation, the partitions of a distributed program need not
be loaded and elaborated all at the same time; they may be loaded and
elaborated one at a time over an extended period of time.  An implementation
may provide facilities to abort and reload a partition during the execution
of a distributed program.
<dt><a name="14">(14)</a><dd>An implementation may allow the state of some of the partitions of a
distributed program to persist while other partitions of the program
terminate and are later reinvoked.
<p><dt><dd><ul>NOTES</ul>
<dt><a name="15">(15)</a><dd><ul>(3) Library units are grouped into partitions after compile time, but
before run time.  At compile time, only the relevant library unit
properties are identified using categorization pragmas.
</ul><dt><a name="16">(16)</a><dd><ul>(4) The value returned by the Partition_ID attribute can be used as a
parameter to implementation-provided subprograms in order to query
information about the partition.
</ul></dl><p>
