  Bump is a little utility to make it easy to keep the version string in your
sources up-to-date. It's ment to be called from the cli or a makefile. Here's
how to call it:

  Format:     Bump <Name> [INCVER] [INCREV] [SETVER = num] [SETREV = num]
                   [QUIET] [ONLYDATE]

  Template:   Name/A,INCVER/S,INCREV/S,SETVER/K/N,SETREV/K/N,QUIET/S,
              ONLYDATE/S,USADATE/S

  With:
              Name     = The name  of  the  source  code  which  contains the
                         version string that must be updated.

              INCVER   = Specifying this  argument   causes  the  program  to
                         increase the version number by one.

              INCREV   = Specifying this  argument   causes  the  program  to
                         increase the revision number  by one.    This is the
                         default setting.

              SETVER   = With this argument you can set the version number to
                         what you want.

              SETREV   = With  this argument  you can set the revision number
                         to what you want.

              QUIET    = Specifying this will prevent Bump from printing  the
                         progress information on the console.

              ONLYDATE = This  specifies  that bump must only re-set the date
                         in the version string.

              USADATE  = Specifies that the user wishes to use USA date format
                         of dd.mm.yy instead of the default European date
                         format of yyyy.mm.dd.

              NOCENT   = Do NOT add the century to the date format (either USA
                         or European).

  Purpose:    To update the version string in a source code file.

  Specification:
    BUMP reads the source code file into memory and  searches for the  string
    "$VER: ". This is identifies the version string.   If  this is  found the
    program  looks  through  the  version  string  to  find  the  version and
    revision numbers.     Then it updates  these  numbers and writes the file
    back to the disk. NOTE:  The version  string  must be formed as described
    in the  "User Interface  Style  Guide"  which  is  as follows:

            $VER: <name> <version>.<revision> (<d>.<m>.<y>)

            <name>      The name of the program.
            <version>   Major version number.
            <revision>  Minor revision number.
            <d>         Day in month created (number)
            <m>         Month created (number)
            <y>         Year created (number)

    The  program  counts  the  '.', '(' and ')'  characters that occur in the
    version string and if it doesn't check out the program exits.    When you
    have an  assembler program called "blurp" created on  friday  the seventh
    of february 1992 and it's version is 37.295  the  string should  be coded
    as follows:

            version_string:
                    dc.b    '$VER: BLURP 37.295 (7.2.92)',0

    When the next day you add a feature you  should call  Bump the  following
    way before assembling the source:

            Bump Blurp.s INCREV

    After this the version string has been changed to the following:

            version_string:
                    dc.b    '$VER: BLURP 37.296 (8.2.92)',0

    The same thing can be done with C sources.

            UBYTE *version_string = "$VER: BLURP 37.295 (7.2.92)";

    After you call Bump Blurp.c INCREV the line with the version string reads

            UBYTE *version_string = "$VER: BLURP 37.296 (8.2.92)";

    As you can see BUMP automatically changes the date to the system  time so
    be  sure that  your clock  is set correctly.  BUMP is pure an can be made
    resident.

  The changes which have been incorporated into this version of Bump include
the following:

  All dates are written with a minimum of two zeros (leading zeros are added).
  The date format is now written in the standard European format of yy.mm.dd
  instead of the ludicrous dd.mm.yy suggested by the style guide.  The format
  of yy.mm.dd is a date which is always sorted within the century and a date
  which is yyyy.mm.dd is always sorted within 10000 years.  It can be used
  without worring about the encroaching melinium.  This program will output
  all 4 digits in the year unless the NOCENT switch is included in the command
  string.
