Backbone
--------

* Remember that pressing HELP at any time during Backbone will bring up
  on-line help for you!

Please note that this is an early version of Backbone released to see how
much interest there is in this sort of thing.
If I get a lot of response (preferably alot of registrations) then I will
continue making it. If on the other hand I get nothing back then I'll leave
it.

So please, if you either like it OR think you would like it if some
improvements were made then let me know!!!

Bug Reports
-----------

If you find a bug or a problem.
First check the manual that you are doing it right.
Next check the Common Problems, How Do I? and Tool Types sections in 
the manual.
If none of this helps.... e-mail me (or write to me)!
