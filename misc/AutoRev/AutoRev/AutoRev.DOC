 AutoRev is a little utility to make it easy to update program-headers. It's
 a CLI command which can be called like this:

    AutoRev <filename> [ASSEM] [MODULA] [UPDATE] [BOTTOM]
                       [AUTHOR <name>] [COPYRIGHT <string>]
                       [REVISION <string>] [COMMENT <string>]
                       [TRANSLATOR <string>]

 Possible argument abbrevations:

        ASS = ASSEM           MOD = MODULA            UPD = UPDATE
        BOT = BOTTOM          AUT = AUTHOR            COP = COPYRIGHT
        REV = REVISION        COM = COMMENT           TRA = TRANSLATOR

 Here is an explanation of the possible arguments:

    filename   - This is a required argument which specifies the name of the
                 header file you  wish to create or  the source you  wish to
                 update.

    ASSEM      - Pass this  in the argument line  if you  wish to  create an
                 assembler source code header. This option is only used when
                 creating a header.

    MODULA     - The  same  as ASSEM  only  this  time  it creates a MODULA/
                 OBERON  source header.  If  "MODULA" and/or "ASSEM" are not
                 specified it will create a C source header.

    UPDATE    -  This  tells  AutoRev to  update  the  source by inserting a
                 "history line"  in  the  file it's header.  It  this  isn't
                 specified  AutoRev  creates a  source  header.  If  AutoRev
                 finds that the  file  it should  create already  exists  it
                 asks you if you want to overwrite it. Be very carefull  not
                 to overwrite important data!

    BOTTOM    -  By default AutoRev will insert the  "history lines" on  top
                 of the other already existing  "history lines". This  tells
                 AutoRev  to  insert  the  "history-line"  below  the  other
                 "history-lines". This  should  be used in combination  with
                 the "UPDATE" option.

    AUTHOR    -  This enables you to specify the  author of the source code.
                 This option should be used when  creating a source  header.
                 The name should not be  longer than 52  characters.

    COPYRIGHT -  This enables  you to specify  some  copyright  information.
                 This option should be used when  creating a source  header.
                 The string should not be longer than 52 characters.

    REVISION  -  This enables you to specify the current revision.  This can
                 be  used  when  creating  or  updating source  headers. The
                 string should not be longer than 7 characters.

    COMMENT   -  This enables  you to add  some additional  comments to  the
                 revision.  This can  be  used  when  creating  or  updating
                 source headers. The string  should  not be  longer  than 42
                 characters.

    TRANSLATOR - This  enables you  to add  information  about the name  and
                 version  of  the  compiler/assembler  you  are using.  This
                 option should be  used when  creating a  source header. The
                 string should not be longer than 52 characters.

 For example if you type the following sequence in the CLI:

    AutoRev rev.mod MODULA AUTHOR "Mr. Modula" COPYRIGHT "© 1991"
            REVISION 0.06a COMMENT "Who cares ?" TRANSLATOR M2Amiga

 It will create the following header:

(*-- AutoRev header do NOT edit!
*
*   Program         :   rev.mod
*   Copyright       :   © 1991
*   Author          :   Mr. Modula
*   Creation Date   :   04-Apr-91
*   Current version :   0.06a
*   Translator      :   M2Amiga
*
*   REVISION HISTORY
*
*   Date          Version         Comment
*   ---------     -------         ------------------------------------------
*   04-Apr-91     0.06a           Who cares ?
*
*-- REV_END --*)

 As you can see AutoRev automatically inserts the correct date if the system
 time is set correct.  Just load the created  file into your  favorite  text
 editor and start  your program at the  bottom of the header.  When you have
 updated your program with (for example) a directory routine you  can update
 the source header by typing the following sequence in the CLI:

    AutoRev rev.mod UPDATE REVISION 0.07 COMMENT "Added directory routine."

 Now the source will look like this:

(*-- AutoRev header do NOT edit!
*
*   Program         :   rev.mod
*   Copyright       :   © 1991
*   Author          :   Mr. Modula
*   Creation Date   :   04-Apr-91
*   Current version :   0.07
*   Translator      :   M2Amiga
*
*   REVISION HISTORY
*
*   Date          Version         Comment
*   ---------     -------         ------------------------------------------
*   04-Apr-91     0.07            Added directory routine.
*   04-Apr-91     0.06a           Who cares ?
*
*-- REV_END --*)

Your program........

 As you can see there is a "history line" added to the list and the  current
 revision number  has been updated.  If you  do not  specify a  new revision
 string the last revision is used again.  Also the old source  code has been
 renamed to "rev.mod.old".  I have  incoorporated this feature to  make sure
 that,  if something goes wrong (who knows ?),  you still have  the original
 source. If you want the new "history line" at the  bottom of  the list  you
 should specify "BOT" or "BOTTOM" in the argument list.

 This program REQUIRES kickstart 2.0 to work  ( almost every  system routine
 called is kickstart 2.0 only! ).  You should  NOT edit in the source header
 between the  line that  reads "Current version :" and  the line that  reads
 "-- REV_END --"  because AutoRev depends on the  data between these  lines.
 AutoRev is pure so it can be made resident.

 Happy revising....
