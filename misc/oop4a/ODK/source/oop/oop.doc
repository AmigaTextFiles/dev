oop.library/--INTRO--

Let me say first, that this lib will NOT enable languages to be OO!

This lib just offers objects, classes and oop like handling to languages 
which don`t offer it. This is NO RUN-TIME-ENVIRONMENT, so some thinks 
are IMPOSSIBLE to do.
The Preprocessor for Preass will show whats possible and you can
build your own preprocessor for every language. With some work on it
you can build everythink you want.

         d0                d0     a0      a1
            
        long = domethode(Object Object,string methodeid,taglist* args)
 
    FUNCTION
        The object methode will be called with the given taglist as parameter.  
        the parameterlist will be translated to d1-a4 regs to make it easier
        to use them. 
 

    INPUTS
        Object  - Object which will use the methode
        Methode - Methodename to call
        args    - Taglist for arguments
        
    RESULT
        object - returns Methode result of -1 for an error

    EXAMPLE

        if (longobject=new("long.class",0)=#0
         {
           result=domethode(longobject,"addition",>tags:10,20,0)
           if result#-1
            {
              printf("10 + 20 = %ld\n",*result)

    FUTURE

        later do methode will be implemented into preass to make
        
        a=longobject.addition(10,20) work..
