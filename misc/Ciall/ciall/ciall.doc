CiAll : performs ci automatically on a project
Author: Dominique Lorre

History:

When I discovered HGWRCS for the first time, I found it very useful, and
in fact this utility has now saved my life more than once for example when
I removed some good code mistakenly.

Anyway, I got big problems with it, essentially because RCS is designed for
programmer teams.

The first one is that RCS impose you to make a ci each time you change a file.
This is because if you wait too much, you will forget what changes you have
made. The second is that ci modifies the file date.

What I want to do with RCS is adding a new feature or solve a bug and then
do a ci. Since I am the only programmer in my project I should be allowed to
do that. For more than one programmers things are differents.

So, I have then written a script file doing what I want. The idea was to call
rcsdiff, put the results in a temporary file and then to display it with more.
this way I can do the ci at any time and while looking at the differences
I can easily write the log messages. I also used the LFORMAT feature of list
for looking at the files modified since my last ci. Unfortunately this didn't
work in the first tries since ci modifies the file date (or do not care to
preserve it). The consequences of this were that I had to look at the complete
project and was obliged to touch the object files to avoid a global
recompilation.

The second try was better, since I managed to get only the files modified since
my last ci. But a few problems were remaining that I think are now solved.

Usage:
    First, you have to decide for an application name. It can be anything except
    AppName since this is the name of the parameter in ciall. For example you
    called it MyApp. Then you will have to initialize the Environnement variables
    with :
    Day2Var lastciMyApp
    This will create lastciMyAppdate and lastciMyApptime which will be stored
    into ENV: and ENVARC:

    When you will want to do some ci then you will have to call

    ciall MyApp

    and the differences of every modified file will be displayed with more,
    a ci will be performed and the file date will be kept, so you will not
    have to touch the object files.

Customization:

    ciall works only in this version for .c and .h files in the current
    directory. To make it work with other projects, you will have to change
    the PAT= parameter of the list call. I have commented out an example
    for entering into a subdirectory called include. If one day the C:List
    function is enhanced to check both the date and the time then the
    Day2Var call will not be necessary any more. And if another day the C:List
    function could provide a way of writing %D %T in lformat without expansion
    the two scripts will not be necessary also.
    The RUN more statement will oblige you to quickly close the window if
    the file has no logs and without RUN you will have to write the logs after
    seeing the diffs. Choose your prefered annoyment ;)

Thanks
    To Heinz Wrobel for his neat HWGRCS.
    To the AmigaDOS staff for providing us this wonderful List command

Distribution
    This is totally FreeWare, you can do what you want with it. Heinz Wrobel
    is allowed to place it in its HWGRCS distribution if he wants.
    You are also allowed to rewrite this in C, in REXX, in ASM or whatever
    you want. I just program DOS scripts when I want some fun but this could
    be more efficient in a true language.

Final Note:
    I hope this will be useful to anyone which really want to use RCS in his
    projects but find this too heavy. May be you should not use it if you
    work in a team.
