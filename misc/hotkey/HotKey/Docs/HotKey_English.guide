 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Introduction  @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

 WFMH @{b}HotKey@{ub} resolver is small and fast... hotkey resolver... ;-)
 It was born during one of translations I worked on for Amiga
 Translators' Organization @{i}(http://home.pages.de/~ATO)@{ui}.
 All was fine until I had to find unique shortcuts all buttons
 appearing in one of windows at once. While fighting with this I
 thought  that I should use the computer for this stupid job...
 So I did it. Because I coudn't find program I needed I sat down
 and quickly wrote this @{b}HotKey@{ub} resolver.


 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Features  @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   * small and fast
   * offers project files to store your work
   * uses HotKey banks for accurate key matching
   * uses Dictionaries to verify correctness of defined keys and to avoid
     non-standard shortcuts
   * StrictMode for solving hotkeys for gadgets and ExpandedMode for menus
   * fully localized
   * HotKey banks and Dictionaries can be easily added, modified and
     expanded by the user
   * Creates strings ready to use either in gadgtes or menus
   * highly uses locale.library so takes care on national characters
   * hotkey driven GUI :-)

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Usage  @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

 The usage of this program is very simple. All you need is to enter all
 strings you want to find hotkeys for and lanuch the built-in resolver.
 You do this using the main window panel (if you use non-proportional font
 the diagram placed below may look strange a bit) with some help of @{" menu " link "Usage" 0}

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}HotKey Bank   @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   Hotkey banks give you possibility to be more restrictive in
 hotkey  selection  process. Usage is very simple: if key doesn't exists
 in loaded bank it is not allowed to use it. Of course this feature is
 optional, so you should set it to @{b}OFF@{ub} whenever you don't need
 it.

   Creating hotkey banks is very simple and can be made with any text
 editor (ED, CED, GoldED etc). You may make this file as long as you
 need, however internally HotKey keeps only 256 characters (as there's no
 more ASCII codes used). It does not means it will truncate your file
 after reading first 256 bytes! Load routine is smart enough to avoid
 duplicates, so don't worry. Take a look at enclosed banks for example.


 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Dictionary  @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

 *** I'll describe it later (It's not functional yet anyway :-) ***


 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Locked keys   @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   Using locked keys you may define these keys which you don't want to
 be allowed (e.g. you should type "SUC" if you got "SAVE", "USE",
 "CANCEL" gadgets visible all the time and you don't want to have
 duplicated keys for other buttons).


 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Status column  @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   Status column describes status of each line. It mostly indicated
 errors, so it's advised to make all entries correct before you run the
 resolver. Possible states are indicated by single letter. For better
 editing all strings being in abnormal state will be highlighted. And
 here's the meaning of the letters:

   @{b}@{fg shine}B@{ub}@{fg text} - hotkey you wish to use for the string doesn't exist in loaded
       HotKey bank and therefore (if bank is choosen correctly) may
       not be usable within the app.

       @{fg shine}Solutions:@{fg text}

        1. Choose other key
        2. Leave this field blank and let program find the proper one
        3. Load correct HotKey bank or expand the one you use (be
           careful adding new keys).
        4. Check correctness of state of CaseSensitive mode switch
           and adjust if necessary

   @{b}@{fg shine}D@{ub}@{fg text} - hotkey you wish to use for this string is already used for other one
       (check above strings).

       @{fg shine}Solutions:@{fg text}

        1. Choose other key
        2. Leave this field blank and let program find the proper one
        3. Check correctness of state of CaseSensitive mode switch
           and adjust if necessary

   @{b}@{fg shine}L@{ub}@{fg text} - hotkey you wish to use for this string is defined as locked one
       and therefore further using may cause problems within the app
       (mainly duplicated hotkeys).

       @{fg shine}Solutions:@{fg text}

        1. Choose other key
        2. Leave this field blank and let program find the proper one
        3. Adjust locked keys
       
   @{b}@{fg shine}R@{ub}@{fg text} - Resolver coudn't choose correct hotkey for the string. Possible
       reasons are:

        1. All letters were used for other strings (resolver acts
           on each entry of the list, starting at the topmost).
        2. Resolver works in StrictMode and no letter existing in the
           string left unused.
        3. Resolver works in StrictMode with CaseSensitive option and
           no letter existing in the string, matching proper capitation,
           left unused.

       @{fg shine}Solutions:@{fg text}

        1. Choose key manually
        2. Drag string at the top of the list.
        3. Check state of StrictMode switch and adjust if necessary
        4. Check state of CaseSensitive switch and adjust if necessary
        5. Change (extend) the string if possible



 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Sugestion column   @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   In this column you will find program sugestions displayed
 everytime you run the resolver. You may accept the all using
 @{b}Accept sugestions@{ub} menu item (they will appear in
 Key column) or clear them all using @{b}Clear all sugested
 hotkeys@{ub}.


 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Key column   @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   In this column you will find hotkeys which are defined to be
 used for given string.


 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}String column   @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   As you can see, here is the base string displayed.


 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}String, HotKey and NoKey gadgets  @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   You can type your string in this gadget whenever you define new
 one, or edit existing one if you are just doing so. If you have already
 chosen the key for the string, just type it using @{b}HotKey@{ub} gadget.
 If you wish the string to have no key (it makes such entry almost
 senseless in this application (except for cases you temporairly
 disabled it for testing etc), but it you want to have all your strings
 here, you just have such possibility), use @{b}No Key@{ub} gadget.
 @{b}NOTE:@{ub} your hotkey will @{b}not@{ub} be lost if you use @{b}No Key@{ub} checkmark.
 It will be shown on the display any longer, but will be kept in memory
 and saved with the whole project as well. If you change your mind, you
 can always restore it by switching @{b}No Key@{ub} off. If there was
 any key defined before, it simply appears again.
 

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}New and Delete gadgets  @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   Using this gadgets you can create new entries in the database
 or kill existing ones.

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Tips and tricks   @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

   * If you double click the "Sug" column, the sugested key will be
     put in the "Key" column.  NOTE:  If you got any key typed there it
     will be lost w/o any warning.  Of course you may double click the
     "Key" column too, and the action will be opposite.  Finally you may
     double click the "String" column to quickly exchange the keys.

   * @{b}Sugest single hotkey@{ub} works always, doesn't matter if you
     got a key defined or not. However it will always sugest you different
     key that this one you already have (because at first step it builds a
     table of used keys for own purposes and your defined key will treated
     as "InUse"). If you receive "R" (Not resolved - mostly happen when you
     work in Strict Mode) status, be sure that the key you got is the only
     one you can have for this string (of course if it will cause other
     error reports ;-)

   * If you often work with StrictMode turned off you may be interested
     in setting, let say, priority for each key stored in the bank.
     If you don't know yet, you have to have any hotkey bank loaded to
     make non strict mode running. Take any text editor and put most
     wanted keys on the begining of the line and less wanted at the end
     (for instance: in bank Alphanumeric letter 'a' is most important,
     while '9' will be used if any other key won't fit).


   That's all folks. Maybe you know more?

 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Known bugs   @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

 As far as I know there's no serious bugs, however due
 to Murphy laws there have to be at least one, so if you
 get track of it, please inform @{" me " link "Credits" 0}


 @{b}@{u}@{fg shine}Problems I know about:   @{ub}@{uu}@{fg text}

 About window's scroll text may be partially unreadable with
 some fonts. This is not a bug, but kind of side effect caused by
 non-sizeable window making text object to always be sized to
 match the witdh of the logo image. Depending on the font's size
 it might appear much enough to fit all strings or too tall.  The
 only solution for you is to set taller or proportional font for the
 application in MUI preferences.  I might reedit the strings to short'em
 down, but don't expect it to happen to soon (if ever).
