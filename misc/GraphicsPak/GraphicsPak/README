The Graphics Package (graphics_pak) is one of my useful packages of simple
functions for quick and easy programming of standard graphics operations.

The package gives simple one-call functions to allocate, manipulate, and free
BitMaps, open and close libraries, and draw pixels, lines, rectangles, and
text. These are quite simple, and normally replace two or three lines of code
to accomplish the same thing. Some of these should have been done as macros,
but these are easier to modify. If you are looking for speed, and don't want
the extra function-calling overhead, the drawing functions are probably
worthless. However, I use the library functions in all my programs:

An example:

    OpenLibraries(GFXBASE|INTUITIONBASE|DISKFONTBASE);
         .
         .
         .
    CloseLibraries();         /* easy, huh? */


Don't forget to include the "graphics_pak.h" file in your programs.

Refer to "graphics_pak.doc" for more info.

Feel free to use these functions or the object module in your programs. If
you end up just linking in the graphics_pak.o object module, kindly mention
me in your credits, eh? Enjoy.
