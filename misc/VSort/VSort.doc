This small MUI-programm visualises 8 different sortingprocesses.

How to use it ?
---------------

Simly start it by typing it`s name or doubleclicking it`s icon.

After this a small window should popup anywhere on your wb-screen. Inside you
see following gadgets :

Settings
	Sorttyp	: what algorithm
	Datatyp	: how the testdata should be generated
		sorted			: makes not much sense
		megerd			: the data is sorted and <swapct.> times merged
		reversed		: the data is backwards sorted - interesting
		rev + merged	: the data is backwards sorted and merged like above
	Swapct.	: how many times two randomly choosen elements are swaped
	Size	: size of testdata (don`t choose size larger than your screen)
	Delay	: delay between one sortingstep - a small dalay may enhance the
              graphic output (I don`t use double-buffering).
			  A value of 5 may be advisable.
Control
	Go		: starts the process
			  and opens another window on your wb. In this one you can see the
			  testdata as small points.

				^ value of element in sortarray
				| .           :
				|    .      .
				|          .
				|  .         :.
				|   .    .
				|.:   :     .
				+----------------> number of element in testarray

			 Now its recommendable to drag the window to the bottom screenborder.
			 To start the demonstartion press >space/enter/return< and you will
			 see that the points start moving around. If the you see a straigth
			 line (like the following) from bottom-left to top-rigth corner the
			 process is finished.

				^ value of element in sortarray
				|           /
				|         /
				|       /
				|     /
				|   /
				| /
				+----------------> number of element in testarray

			 Press a mousebutton or <space/enter/return> key to continue.
			 Try different algorithms and datatypes to see how them work.

	Exit	: exits the programm
	About	: important feature ! >8-)

The source-code
---------------

You can use anything in the source, if you want. If you have anything to sort
then don`t use bubblesort. It`s very slow on large data. And quick-sort is easy
to implement too.
