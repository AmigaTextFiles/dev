@NODE main  "GTBTranslatorPPC© 2003 User Manual:"
@TOC "Contents"
  This manual is intended as an aid in using the @{B}GTBTranslatorPPC ©@{UB}
  system.  It is not intended to be used as a primer on the SmallTalk language
  or C or @{" GadToolsBox " LINK "gadtoolsbox"}.  @{B}GTBTranslatorPPC ©@{UB} is a program that takes the
  output files of @{" GadToolsBox " LINK "gadtoolsbox"} V2.0b & translates their contents into either
  a C source file or an AmigaTalk source file.

  The main reason I wrote these program(s) is because I got tired of
  editing the generated C source files from @{" GadToolsBox " LINK "gadtoolsbox"}.  It takes at least
  two hours per project simply to make the output from @{" GadToolsBox " LINK "gadtoolsbox"} readable
  & compilable.  There are also several problems that have to be corrected
  in order for the generated source to run correctly as well.  @{B}GTBTranslatorPPC@{UB}
  will also generate a MakeFile & the Locale header file associated with
  your C-source code.  The generated makefile has to be renamed by you because
  your source directory might already have one present, so GTBTranslatorPPC will
  generate the makefile as @{FG SHINE}ProjectName.make@{FG TEXT}.
  
  Currently, GTBTranslatorPPC is intended to generate simple, one-window
  GUIs.
  
  In order to use GTBTranslatorPPC, you have to have the @{" Requirements " LINK "requirement"}.

@NODE "idTags" "Tag strings used by GTBScanner:"

  GTBScannerPPC looks for tags in a *.template file in order to determine where to
  place certain parts of generated code into either the C-source file or
  in an AmigaTalk source file.  The following tags are used in a C-template 
  file in order to figure out where to place the various parts of the GUI
  specified in the *.ini file generated from the @{" GadToolsBox " LINK "gadtoolsbox"} *.gui file:
  
  $ProjectFileName      -- The ProjectFileName from [ProjectDataTags] goes here

  $MainSettings         -- Generate the code required to interface to the GUI.

@NODE ToDoList "Unfinished business:"

  The following parts of the @{B}GTBTranslatorPPC ©@{UB} program still need work:

  1. Re-write GTBScannerPPC to account for multiple windows/projects in a
     @{" GadToolsBox " LINK "gadtoolsbox"} source file (*.gui).

  2. Complete program documentation (yeah, right!).
  
@ENDNODE

@NODE "TroubleShooting" "TroubleShooting GTBTranslatorPPC:"

   First of all, let me state that this section of the help
   system is far from complete.  I've added a lot of error detection
   code to GTBTranslatorPPC (this is one of the reasons it's gotten so big),
   but I cannot account for everything that a User's system has installed
   or things that might be missing.  The program has been tested on
   an A4000T with a 68060 50Mhz CPU, & a CyberVision 64D graphics card, and
   the AmigaOne PowerPC running AmigaOS4.

   The program has always compiled with the SAS-C Compiler V6.5+).  
   The program has also been compiled with gcc V2.95.3.
   
   I've avoided depending on 3rd-party shared libraries (such as MUI, etc), 
   but there might be some code that still uses older shared 
   Amiga-supplied libraries.  
   
   Verify that your system meets the @{" Requirements " LINK "requirement"}.
    
   Next check the GTBTranslatorPPC directory @{" Configuration " LINK "DiskConfig"}.

   Examine the @{" GTBTranslatorPPC.info " LINK "ToolTypes"} file & verify 
   the ToolTypes match your needs & file configuration.
   
   Verify that your problem is not a @{" Known Bug " LINK "Bugs"}.
    
   If you have previous version(s) of GTBTranslatorPPC, see if they work for you.

   Try running the program from a Shell/CLI & see what error messages the
   program generates.

   Make sure that you have not changed the Icon toolTypes to garbage (you did 
   keep a backup of the icon didn't you?  If not, unarchive the original icon).
      
   If you have SnoopDOS available use it to see what the program is looking
   for that you do not have installed on your system.
   
   If all this does not solve your problem, then send an email to @{" me " LINK "Author"}.   

   See Also, @{" Warranty           " LINK "warranty"} (yeah right).

@NODE Bugs "Bugs known to the Author of GTBTranslatorPPC:"

  The following bugs are known to the @{" Author: " LINK "Author"}

  1. The Scanner cannot generate multiple-Window *.gui files completely.

  2. @{" GadToolsBox " LINK "gadtoolsbox"} always adds IDCMP_INTUITICKS, IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS & 
     IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE to the *.gui file it generates, no matter if you
     clear their CheckBoxes or not, so you will have to edit these out of
     the final source file that you generate (sorry).

  Simply click on the @{B}GTBTranslatorPPC@{UB} Install Icon to install the program.

  There might be more files in some directories, so this list represents only
  the minimum that you received.
     
  This is the layout of the GTBTranslatorPPC environment that you need to have
  in order to suppress un-wanted requester activity:
  
  Assign GTBTranslatorPPC:  to a directory or partition: DH0:GTBTranslator/ (example)

  GTBScannerPPC           -- Converts .gui file into a .ini file.
  GenC.template           -- Used by GTBTranslatorPPC to make the C-source file(s).

@NODE distribution "GTBTranslatorPPC distribution:"

   @{B}DISTRIBUTION
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~@{UB}
   This software package is @{B}ShareWare@{UB}. It may be put on any
   media which is used for the distribution of ShareWare, like Public
   Domain disk collections, CDROMs or FTP servers.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package, distributors
   should use the complete original distribution. The author cannot be held
   responsible if this software has become unusable due to modifications
   of the distribution contents or of the distribution files themselves.
   There is no limit on the costs of the distribution, e.g. for the media,
   like floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact disks, or the process of
   duplicating.  Such limits have been proven to be harmful to the idea of
   shareware, i.e., instead of reducing the price of the
   floppy disk below the limit, the software was simply removed from the
   master disk.

   Although the @{" Author " LINK Author} does not impose any limit on the 
   distribution of this software, he would like to express his personal 
   opinions on this matter:

   * This software package should be made available to everyone free of
     charge whenever it is possible (so they can send me money instead ;)).

   * If you have acquired this software package under normal conditions
     from a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk at a price higher than
     US $5, then you have definitely paid too much.  Please don't
     support this improper profit-making any longer and switch to a
     less expensive source as soon as possible.

@ENDNODE

@NODE startup "Running the system:"
@PREV main

  The GTBTranslatorPPC system is invoked by typing the command @{FG SHINE}GTBTranslatorPPC@{FG TEXT}
  or by clicking on the GTBTranslatorPPC icon.  The main GUI should be self-
  explanatory -- simply enter the two required file names & click on the 
  task button that you wish to have the program perform.

  After you enter your *.gui source filename & your *.ini destination filename,
  clicking on the @{B}Make @{U}P@{UU}roject@{UB} button will:

     1. GTBScannerPPC will read & parse the *.gui file & produce the *.ini file,
        after you have supplied any additional information you require into
        the second GUI Requester for Project Information.
     
  Next, you can edit the *.ini file (if necessary).  Finally, you can
  check the @{B}Generate @{U}S@{UU}MakeFile@{UB} or @{B}Generate @{U}L@{UU}ocale@{UB} 
  Check Gadgets & click on the @{B}Output @{U}C@{UU} Source@{UB} button.
      
     2. @{B}GTBTranslatorPPC@{UB} will read the *.ini file & the GenC.template file & generate
        the final C-source file, as well as a MakeFile & LocaleFile (if
        you checked them in the GUI).
 
  Now you can edit the MakeFile or Locale *.cd file by pressing:
     @{B}Edit @{U}M@{UU}akeFile@{UB} or
     @{B}Edit L@{U}o@{UU}cale@{UB} button Gadgets.
	
  The @{B}Output @{U}A@{UU}migaTalk Source@{UB} button will generate Smalltalk code for the
  AmigaTalk programming system (when it's ready).

  NOTE:  The ToolTypes ListView Gadget is read-only.
