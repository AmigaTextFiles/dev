Thanks to Olaf `Olsen' Barthel, author of gtlayout.library.  It is by far
the best user interface package.  Also thanks for all his programming help.


The user interface is totally font and screen mode sensitive.  All
gadgets and the window will automatically adjust to match your preferences.


The latest features are utilized to get the most from the operating
system and to make the program the best of it's kind.

This is program is totally localized to allow support for foreign
languages.  A catalog may not be available for your language at this time,
but one will hopefully be available soon.


If you are willing to translate the strings to another language, please let
me know.  If you do offer, a perfect translation of all strings will be
expected.  It is all or nothing.  I will also be seeking your assistance for
future versions that have new strings.

@NODE OperationNotes "Operation Notes"
@TOC Main
@{LINDENT 1}

@{b}Operation Notes@{ub}



Press the Help key for AmigaGuide help.


It can be started in WBStartup and iconified so it is always available.


The Load Preferences and Save Preferences menus load/save the Project Name,
Project Path, Version Name and Language.


The Load and Save gadgets load/save the version statistics.


If you specify AUTOBUMP, VERSION, DATE, or TIME the user interface will
not be opened.


If you want support for other programming languages, send me several example
files with comments with everything that is included in the C version.


NOTE: The first 10 lines MUST be the same for all languages, except for the
comment types.  Anything afterwards can be changed.

I try to make sure all new additions or changes work correctly before
releasing a new version, but, something might get by.  If you encounter a
bug or a problem with hardware or other programs, please let me know.  Do
not assume it will be fixed in the next version because if no one tells me,
I may not find it.


Please be very specific about what the bug does, when it does it, how
you found it, and how I can re-create it to test it.  Also let me know what
your system consists of: Kickstart version, hard-drives, memory expansion,
accelerator card, chip set (original, ECS, AGA), etc.


If you find a program that is not compatible with this program, please
send it to me on a disk or via electronic mail.



Thanks to Christopher A. Gaul for beta testing and several ideas for this program.

@{b}System Requirements@{ub}



This program requires at least version V39 of the operating system
software.  This is to take advantage of the new commands and new tags.  It
is now easy enough to update your system so it should not pose a problem.


This program requires less than 512K of RAM, therefore it should
operate on all systems.


To use the full potential, a harddrive and 4 or more megs or RAM are
recommended but not required.


The user interface can be quite large at times.  I strongly suggest you use
a screen size of 800x600 or larger.  If use a smaller size, the interface may
not be able to created.

@{b}About Swiss Army Knife Utilities@{ub}



The Swiss Army Knife Utilities is an every growing collection of programs
written by Mark Ritter.  All of these programs were written for a few basic
reasons: to make programming more automated, to replace poorly written
programs, or to fill a void where a program did not exist.


These programs are mostly meant to be replacement programs for poorly written,
or out dated programs.  Every needed feature has been incorporated to make the
programs powerful, yet very simple to use.


All of the utilities have been built around the gtlayout.library user interface
library.  MUI is an excellent package, but it is too CPU intensive and is not
based on the standard GadTools gadgets.  It all comes down to a matter of
preference.


The Swiss Army Knife Utilities have been written in well planned modular code.
All the programs have the same interface layout, the same AmigaGuide layout,
and the same operation.  If you know how one program works, then you know how
all of the programs work.  This modular code also makes for quick and easy
updates for every program.


Some of the global features:

    · They are all Commodities.

    · When iconified, it does so with an AppIcon and an AppMenu.

    · Drag-n-drop on AppIcon.

    · Extended select with AppIcon and AppMenu.

    · Drag-n-drop into window.

    · Extended select supported at startup.

    · Press Help for on-line AmigaGuide support.

    · Universal command line arguments.

    · Asl file requesters remember last path and file.

    · Fully localized and font sensitive.

    · Supports screennotify.library.

    · Most string gadgets have history.


Most of the programs have small interfaces, but a few are quite large.  All
of the programs are best used on an 800x600 screen; some will not fit on a
smaller screen.  800x600 is the standard, so the programs have been written for
this screen size.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Preliminary construction.

- Changes gadget layout several times.

- Many, many new internal features/updates/fixes.

- Wrote AmigaGuide.

- Public release.



Version 1.1     Completed: 21.2.97

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated gadgets, the layout, the handler, etc.

- Paged the gadgets to make the interface smaller.

- Updated load/save Version.h routines.

- Due to an early oversight, Version.h will be used for ALL output languages.

- Added Assembly output.

- Added Pascal output.

- Now switches to first page, Names, when Add a new project.

- Now only supports Assembly and C output.  Technical reasons.

- Now handles versions like V123.456 correctly.

- Changed comment type from // to /* ... */ for strict ANSI programmmers.

- Minimum Version is now 0 instead of 1.

- Added Revision Places gadget.

- Added E support.  Project ID is not supported.

- Updated AmigaGuide.



Version 1.2     Completed: 5.6.97

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The Output Language for each project is now saved in the prefs file.  This

  allows for correct extensions for each language: .i, .h, .e, .pas.

  Default is C.

  You must set each projects desired language and save the preferences.

- Added a gadget to allow you to set the Version.x file to whatever you want.

- Put Pascal back in.  The above allowed for it since the file can now be set to

  the same name as the main module.

- By popular demand all the Swiss Army Knife Utilities have been updated:

    · They are now Commodities.

    · When iconified, it now does so with an AppIcon and an AppMenu.

    · Drag-n-drop on AppIcon.

    · Extended select with AppIcon and AppMenu.

    · Drag-n-drop into window.

    · Extended select supported at startup.

    · New config load/save module.  Older prefs files will not be a problem.

    · Rewrote AmigaGuides, twice.

    · Updated icon tool types.

    · Fixed and updated the About window.

    · deutsch catalog supplied by Walter Gierholz.

    · Many other internal code updates.

    · Changed command line argument NOUI/S to UI/K.

    · Added support for screennotify.library.

    · If program is already running and only 1 is copy allowed, another copy can

      pop up the original program's interface or terminate it.

    · magyar catalog supplied by Álmos Rajnai.

- added line: #define DATE  RELEASE_DATE   to make compatible with BumpRev.

- Put Project ID back in for E.  I hope it's correct.

- Updated to handle my new SAK_EasyRequest().

- Updated AmigaGuide.

- Public release.
