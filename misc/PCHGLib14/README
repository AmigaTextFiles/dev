This archive contains the PCHG (Palette CHanGe) IFF chunk specs and tools.
The new IFF chunk PCHG allow to specify line-by-line palette changes in a
simple way which is independent of the video mode; while it allows up to
65536 registers, it's usually shorter of an equivalent CTBL or SHAM chunk.
Library code with full source and documentation is provided for a
straightforward implementation in your programs. PCHG has been developed in
BIX through an open discussion of many Amiga programmers, and it is our hope
that it will become the Amiga standard for palette change technology. The
difference between the current release of this archive and release 1.2 are a
recompilation, an update of the included tools, and a fix of a couple of
minor bugs.

Included in the archive is the latest version of Mostra (2V15), which
features full PCHG support, and MakeVPort_Patch, which installs a small
patch to MakeVPort() that fixes a small bug of user copper lists under 2.04.
The bug is non-existent under 3.0.

LightHouse and Lake are two very impressive multipalette pictures converted
by Ed Hanway's HamLabPlus. Mostra will allow you to look at LightHouse in
AUTOSCROLL mode.

Documentation about the format is provided in Texinfo, dvi, AmigaGuide® and
PostScript format (PCHG.texinfo, PCHG.dvi, PCHG.guide and PCHG.ps).
Documentation about the support routines is provided in standard Autodoc
format.

The ToPCHG program is a dirty hack mainly useful for producing test pictures.
Documentation is included in the source file.
