  PPMS comes with a small program called 'Projects' which in short will
  display a directory list of a specified directory. It is mainly for
  the quick loading of projects directly to PPMS, however could be used
  for other purposes such as quickly viewing directories.

  TEMPLATE from CLI:
     D=DIR/K/A,F=FONT,FS=FONTSIZE/N,OP=OLDLOOKPROP/S,ML=MAXLINES/N,I=INDENT/S,NB=NOBACKFILL/S

  TOOLTYPES:
     DIR             Initial directory to look at
     FONT            Font to use
     FONTSIZE        Font size
     OLDLOOKPROP     By default uses a NEWLOOKPROP, set this to use shitty black one
     MAXLINES        Maximum number of lines in window
     INDENT          Set to indent instead of extrude the highlight box
     NOBACKFILL      Set to disable the backfill patttern

  To load a project highlight by moving the mouse over it and click.
  At present nothing but projects will do anything.

  To quit press the right mouse button.

  @{b}@{u}The concept of PPMS@{ub}@{uu}

  Programmers Project Management System (PPMS) is a complete system to create
  and manage projects by way of an easy to use GUI.

  After trying to maintain projects in the editors I usually use I found the
  following problems:
  - Alterations and management of makefiles becomes unbearable.
  - Selecting files in my projects to edit was a pain, having to load from
    a requester or equivilent.
  - Easily changing options for each source files or all of them was
    painful having to alter makefiles.
  - Debugging was difficult.
  - Error management had to be done through external programs.
  - Plenty of other problems which stemmed from these problems.
  - Some other project management programs were just too inflexable or
    unusable.


  So I decided to fix this once and for all...

  Here are some of PPMS's features:
  - Full project source files list manipulation.
  - Unlimited source files of any kind (C, Assembler, E, etc.)
  - Different compiling options for each source file.
  - File dependancies for each source file.
  - Ability to compile each source file to a seperate executable or
    seperately as one executable.
  - Compilation of source file currently being edited or
  - Project building of modified source files only or
  - Project building of all source files or
  - (Re)linking of project executable.
  - Ability to set executable file name for linked projects.
  - Customizable output (running or debugging) and compilation windows.
  - Multiple configurable translators (compilers, assemblers etc.)
  - Nested header checking for C source files.
  - Error parsing with warning suppression for each translator.
  - Full linker control.
  - Configurable linker lib modules.
  - Debugging control.
  - Full AREXX interface control.
  - Editor preferences allowing customization of any editor supporting
    AREXX so that the user can
    select the editor most suited to a project and be ready to program
    immediately.

@node "Registration" "Registration"

  @{b}@{u}Registration@{ub}@{uu}

  This software is SHAREWARE and needs a keyfile to become completely
  functional. Without the keyfile PPMS is limited in several ways:
  · An about requester will appear occasionly.
  · A limit of 5 files per project.
  · Limited to one translator per project.
  · Boldface and italics disabled in output window which makes reading it
    more difficult and unpleasant.
  · BUILD ALL and BUILD FORCELINK disabled.
  · COMPILE disabled.
  · ERROR FIRST and ERROR PREVIOUS disabled.

  The price for registration for private use is:
    Australia   A$20 or
    Other      US$20

  If a commercial company is interested in using multiple copies then a
  price based on the order can be arranged.

  The easiest way to register is to send cash with a registration form to:

      Ian Masters
      PO Box 764
      Launceston 7250
      Tasmania, Australia

  Please, do not send any kind of foreign cheques as banks charge rediculous
  amounts of money to change them. If you really want to do this then include
  an extra $10 for the conversion.

  Include your name, address, phone number (international) and e-mail address
  (if applicable) for my purposes.

  Once registered you will receive the latest version with the keyfile which
  will 'unlock' all features making it fully functional. All future updates
  will be usable in full, all that is required is to download the latest updates
  from a BBS or Internet.

   - Files
       The files listview contains the source files you want to be able to
       access. Thay don't neccissarily have to be compilable.
       Three columns are available:
   1. Files      - Files shown in bold have a translator so are
	 compilable.
	 Files shown in italics are not going to be compiled
	 when the project is built.
	 To make a file not compile double click on it's name
	 on the left column of the listview to toggle it
	 between italics (not compilable) and normal
	 (compilable) typefaces. Double clicking on a file
	 with no translator will do nothing.
   2. Options    - These are local compilation options for each source
	 file. To edit a files options double click on this
	 column and modify the string gadget which will
	 appear.
   3. Dependants - These are dependant files which will make the source
	 file compile if they are newer than the object file.
	 To add or remove dependant files double click on
	 this column and modify with the window which will
	 appear using the Add and Remove buttons.
       Add            - Add file(s) to the listview.
       Remove         - Remove file(s) from the listview.
       Edit           - Load file(s) from the listview to your chosen editor.
       Clear          - Clear all files from the listview.

   - Options
       Exe name          - Executable name for the project. There are the
	    following special tags:
	     %src     - the file currently being edited.
	     %mod     - the file currently being edited
		   without extension.
	     %base    - the file currently being edited
		   without extension or path.
	     %arg     - the arguments sent to the program when
		   run as below.
       Arguments         - The arguments for the executable. There are the
	    following special tags:
	     %src     - the file currently being edited.
	     %mod     - the file currently being edited
		   without extension.
	     %base    - the file currently being edited
		   without extension or path.
	     %screen  - the screen the editor is on.
       Output window     - The window or file you want the output of running
	    or debugging
	    to be sent to. If clear the default will be used.
       Compile window    - The window or file you want the output of
	    compilation or building
	    to be sent to. If clear the default will be used.
       Program dir       - The main directory of the project.
       Use debug options - Use debugging options for compilation and linking
	    or not.
       Linker            - Use the linker in building the project or not.
       Link all          - Link files with a translator but not compilable.
	    See the explanation of the Files list above.
       Requester         - Show a requester after compilation or building or
	    not.
       Make Window       - Open the building or compilation window or not.
       Run Window        - Open the run or debugging window or not.

   - Translators
       The listview shows the current translators in this project.
       Add               - Add a new translator.
       Delete            - Delete the active translator.

       Atributes:
    Command             - CLI Command to invoke the translator.
    Debug options       - Global options for source files in debug build
		mode.
    Final options       - Global options for source files in final build
		mode.
		Special tags for both of these are:
	     %src  - the source file
	     %mod  - the source file without extension
	     %base - the source file without extension or
		path
	     %opt  - the source file's local options
	     %obj  - the object file name
	     %mobj - the object file name with path and
		object directory
	     %bobj - the object file name without path
		and object directory

    Source extension(s) - Source file extensions for this translator.
		Multiple
		extensions may be defined be seperating with a
		comma. i.e.
		asm,s,a or .asm,.s,.a
    Object extension    - Extension of this translator file types
		object. i.e. o
		This is so PPMS can find the object files to
		compare dates
		with source files.
    Object directory    - The directory the object files are placed in
		or nothing.
    Ignore Warnings     - Not implemented yet.
    Check Headers       - Check source C files headers to see if they
		are newer than the source. This will only work
		for C files and checks all local
		#include "..." statements.

    Message converter:
      Select the message converter to use for your compiler.
      If you want to write your own converter these are the rules:
	They are standard executable programs called with the output of
	the compiler
	or assembler as an argument. They read the error file directly
	from stdin and write
	directly to stdout.
	Each error or warning has it's own line of the format:
	"#filename# line E|W number: message" where E|W is for Error or
	Warning (not both)

	for example an output for SAS/C might read:

	#helloworld.c# 1 E 4: invalid lexical token
	#helloworld.c# 5 W 73: declaration expected

	This means an error number 4 'invalid lexical token' was found
	at line 1 in helloworld.c and
	a warning number 5 'declaration expected' was found at line 5 in
	helloworld.c

   - Linker
       Command          - CLI Command to execute to invoke the linker.
       Object extension - The extension of the linkers object modules.
       Debug options    - Global options for linker in debug build mode.
       Final options    - Global options for linker in final build mode.
	    Special tags for both of these are:
	      %exe - Project executable name (from Options
		folder - Exe Name)
	      %lnk - File of objects to link with.
	      %obj - List of objects to link with.
	      %err - Error file to send output to.
	      %lib - Linker libs in listview.
       Linker libs:
    These are the libs the linker will link with.
    Add            - Add file(s) to list.
    Delete         - Delete file(s) from list.

   - Debugger
       Command - CLI Command to execute the debugger.
       Options - Options for the debugger. These are the special tags:
	 %exe    - Executable name.
	 %arg    - Executable arguments.
	 %src    - Current source file.
	 %mod    - Current source file without extension.
	 %base   - Current source file without extension or path.

@endnode

@node "Output" "Output"

  @{b}@{u}Output@{ub}@{uu}

  When PPMS is compiling or building a project it will tell you what is
  going on and why. When a file is compiled because it's source is newer
  than it's object it will say so, also if the source is compiled because
  a dependant file is newer than the object file it will tell you which
  dependant file caused the compilation. The same applies for checking
  includes - it will tell you which include file caused the re-compilation.

  The only input the output window allows is CONTROL-C and CONTROL-F.
  CONTROL-C will break compilation or linking and terminate unless:
  CONTROL-F is pressed first which instructs PPMS to just 'skip' this file.

  So if you are building a project and want to terminate immediately just
  press CONTROL-C. But if you are building a project and want to skip one
  file only (for example you are done an optimized build of all files and
  the file PPMS is up to is going to be altered in a moment by you) then
  you press CONTROL-F then CONTROL-C and PPMS will only skip that file and
  continue to build all the other files. (then you have all the files
  optimized except the one you want to alter; and you can alter it and just
  do a plain build which will complete the optimized build).
