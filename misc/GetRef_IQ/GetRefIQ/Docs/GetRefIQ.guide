  A commodity that allows Amiga C and assembler programmers quickly access
           needed information about system calls and structures.
  Even more. It allows something similar to filename completion on Unix or
                          implemented in KingCON.

@node Introduction "Introduction"

GetRefIQ  is  designed  to  help programmers in their everyday work. It is a
commodity  which  on  a  command  finds  specified  specified  reference(s),
structure  definition(s), macro(s), etc. You can use it with any editor that
supports  ARexx (which today doesn't ?) or even with some work, with others.
Of course it is not limited to editors, it has general ARexx port so it easy
to use as you like it. GetRefIQ uses index file produced by @{" GenIndexIQ " link GenIndexIQ.guide/main}.
To run it requires only rexxsyslib.library and about 15 KB of memory.

program  itself.  Neither  the  program  nor  their associated files must be
modified  in  any  way.  The complete distribution package can be compressed
with  one  of  easy  available  archiving programs (like Lha, Tar, etc.). No
charge  must be made for use or distribution of this package. You can upload
it any BBS, include it in a magazine's coverdisk, in a Public Domain library

@node Starting "Getting started"

GetRefIQ  is a commodity to be started from
  @{" Workbench " link StWB},
but it is possible to start it from
  @{" Shell     " link StSh}.
If started twice just both copies quit!

As  a  commodity,  GetRefIQ  supports  Remove and Disable/Enable. When disabled,
everything that comes to ARexx port will be returned with no error code.

@node StSh "Starting from Shell"

Shell template is:
"FROM/M/A,PUBSCREEN=P,WINX/N,WINY/N,EXTENDED=E/S,KEEPINDEX=K/S,HANDLE_LVO=H/S"

FROM file ...    : file ... is list of index files to scan references for,
                   If file name consists space characters then enclose it
                   in quotes. This parameter must be specified, if not
                   GetRefIQ will exit.
PUBSCREEN=P name : specify public screen name to open window on, if there
                   is no such screen, GetRefIQ will open it's window on
                   default public screen.
WINX x           :
WINY y           : specify window positions (default 0, 0).
EXTENDED=E       : turn on extended key handling (read below) (default off).
KEEPINDEX=K      : turn on index caching in memory (default off).
HANDLE_LVO=H     : turn on handling of _LVO prefix for reference names
                   (implemented for Cromax' request :) (default is off).
                   This option works in such a way (if on): First when
                   'GRIQ_FIND key' command is issued, it checks if there is
                   _LVO prefix in a key. If it is, _LVO is cut, and search
                   begins. If something was found and selected, GetRefIQ
                   checks if key had _LVO prefix and if it had one,
                   selected reference is prefixed with it.

@node UsAR "ARexx port and commands"

ARexx  port  name  is  "GetRefIQ".  You  can send following commands and get
following return codes:

GRIQ_QUIT              : tell GetRefIQ to quit
GRIQ_HANDLE_LVO YES|NO : turn on/off HANDLE_LVO option (but only
                         temporarily, until nearest search command is
                         completed)
GRIQ_WINX x            :
GRIQ_WINY y            : specify window positions (also temporarily, as
                         above)
GRIQ_PUBSCREEN name    : specify public screen to open window on
                         (temporary)
GRIQ_FLUSH             : flush index memory (if there were any files kept)
GRIQ_FIND searchkey    : find reference, all references beginning with
                         'searchkey' will be found (searching IS case
                         sensitive!)

If  there is only one reference found GetRefIQ assumes user wanted both info
and  symbol and returns RET_BOTH (about return codes read @{" here " link UsRE}). If there
aren't  any  GetRefIQ will just flash the screen indicating that nothing was
found  and  returns  RET_NONE. If there are more than one reference GetRefIQ
will  open  a  window  allowing  user  select wanted reference and action to
perform on it.

See GetRefIQ.ced for examples how to use GetRefIQ ARexx port.

@node UsGU "GUI and operation"

GUI is completely font sensitive, I tried to do my best to make it work also
under  v2.04,  but  if  something  is  wrong contact me please! There is one
listview  for  selecting appropriate reference. You can select it with mouse
or  using  cursor  keys (up and down). Shifted cursors jump 15 references up
and  down.  Below  there  is  info gadget which displays which file selected
reference comes from (it is handy when you have few the same references that
come  from  different  files,  e.g.  there  are few OpenDevice references in
different  autodocs  files!).  And  at  bottom of the window there are three
gadgets to select action:

Info  : returns RET_INFO and saves information to file returned in ARexx
        variable RESULT2
Symbol: returns RET_SYMBOL and stores selected reference in ARexx variable
        RESULT
Both  : returns RET_BOTH and acts as both RET_INFO and RET_SYMBOL

Supported keys:
I (and RETURN if option EXTENDED is on) : Info
S (and SHIFT-RETURN if EXTENDED on)     : Symbol
B (and ALT-RETURN if EXTENDED on)       : Both
ESC                                     : close window and return RET_EXIT

About return code values read @{" here " link UsRE}.

@node UsRE "ARexx return codes"

0  = RET_NONE  : nothing happened (or port is disabled)
1  = RET_SYMBOL: user selected Symbol
2  = RET_INFO  : user selected Info
3  = RET_BOTH  : user selected Both
4  = RET_EXIT  : user took no action
10 = RET_ERROR : something went wrong
                 (couldn't open window, no memory, etc.)

All stuff contained here in this package was brought to you by

                     Radoslaw Chyra (Chyras/NegativeIQ)

I'm  a  23  year old student at Wroclaw University. I study Computer Science
and now I'm trying to finish my third and fourth year (together :) At home I
use  Amiga1200  self  made Tower with 540 MB harddisk. I also own Pentium PC
box,  but  the  only thing I use there is Linux and appropriate programming,
TeXing,  etc.  stuff.  MS-DOS,  Win***s  and  similar suck. Definitely suck.
Although it's my opinion :)

I  started with my first computer Amiga 500 back in 1987. I coded some demos
in assembler under the name of PEPSI Drinkers Inc. Then I moved to coding OS
compliant software (still in assembler) and together with Grzegorz Calkowski
(UncleMat)  we  formed Beet Development Group. Now I programm under the name
of NegativeIQ which is two-person programming team. Second member is Szeryf,
who is PC owner.

@node Thanks "Thanks and Final words"

Here I would thank Anders Melchiorsen for his FetchRefs, which didn't fit my
requirements but forced me to write my own program to fetch references.

Also thanks to Cromax/Alchemy who submitted with some useful suggestions and
comments in development stage. He also supplied GetRefIQ.ced ARex script.

The  last  one  but  not  least  whom  I  would  thank  is Robert George Wal
(Reptile),  who pointed my attention at BGUI library and convinced me to use
it, instead of MUI (although programming in MUI was easier I think, for such
a small program like GenIndexIQ MUI is too big and too slow).

Yeah! Almost forgot to thank Jan van der Baard and Ian Einman for BGUI, and
Nico Francois and Magnus Homgren for ReqTools!

As  I'm still waiting to get my hands on Blizzard 1240T/ERC accelerator, I'm
stuck  with  2MB Amiga. It's really hard to program on it, especially when I
use  SAS/C  6.56  compiler,  but  even  with  that troubles, I must say that
development  on  Amiga  is much easier for me than on PC or Unix (I use them
both,  so  I  can  compare).  The  worst  is PC, no multitasking, that's it!
Although  I would like to have such environment and system capabilities like
on Unix, hope PPC Amiga will be out soon!

As  a next project I'll probably pick up my old unfinished project of Module
Manager  (as  I  collect  modules)  and concurrently I'll try to develop GUI
layout  engine  under  XWindows  and Windows'95 (together with Szeryf). It's
strange, but I haven't seen any layout engines on both platforms which would
be similar to MUI, BGUI, Triton, EAGUI etc. engines on Amiga ... Strange!

GetRefIQ was tested on:
  Amiga 500 with 0.5MB chip and 2 MB Slow equipped with KS2.04
  Amiga 1200 with 2MB chip and KS3.0
  Amiga 1200/Blizzard 030/50 2MB chip and 8MB fast with KS3.1
