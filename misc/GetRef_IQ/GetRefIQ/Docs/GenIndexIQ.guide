@node Introduction "Introduction"

GenIndexIQ  is an utility to scan autodocs or include (both C and assembler)
files  for  reference(s), structure definition(s), macro(s), etc., and store
it  into  index  file.  GenIndex can work without GUI or use BGUI library to
create one. When GUI is opened then also ReqTools library is neccessary (for
file requesters). As for now GenIndexIQ recognizes following file types:

  @{" Autodocs               " link InAu}
  @{" C header files         " link InCH}
  @{" Assembler header files " link InAs}

If  you  want  me  to  build  support for your favourite language then don't
hesitiate  to contact me (address @{" here " link Author}). But send me examples of files to
scan and point my attention at things I should scan for!

@node InAu "Autodocs"

I  tried  it  with  original  Amiga  Autodocs,  MUI,  BGUI, ReqTools and XPK
autodocs.  Worked.  Although  in  some of Amiga autodocs there was a problem
with long function names. For example in amigaguide.doc there is a line:

amigaguide.library/OpenAmigaGuideAsyncAamigaguide.library/OpenAmigaGuideAsyncA

which  has  no separator between two function names. I suggest correcting it
manually  and  rescanning  again.  There is not much I can do about it in my
scanner, it would be too complicated.

@{" <- Back " link Introduction}
@endnode

@node InCH "C header files"

Scans  for  '#define's  and  'struct's.  Hopefully recognizes everything. If
there are statements like this:

#ifdef foo
#define bar(p) ...
#else
#define bar(p,q) ...
#define

both definitions are scanned and recognized, and are displayed as

bar(p)
bar(p,q)

so you can choose one you want.
Of  course parser skips comments ! Hmmm ... C style comments ... C++ soon to
be implemented.

@{" <- Back " link Introduction}
@endnode

@node InAs "Assembler header files"

This was hard one! :)

Scans for 'STRUCTURE's, 'MACRO's, 'BITDEF's and 'EQU's.

With  'BITDEF's there is some problem, something that produces MEMF_CHIP and
MEMB_CHIP looks like

MEM,CHIP,...

and as such is displayed in reference list, I'll think about it in future.

@node Starting "Getting started"

GenIndexIQ  may  be  started  only from CLI. I haven't implemented Workbench
support because I think it is unnecessary. Here is template:

"FROM/M,TO,RECURSE=R/S,VERBOSE=V/S,KEEPEMPTY=K/S,KEEPFNDEF=D/S,GUI/S"

FROM     : list of files and/or directories to scan for autodocs and
           includes
TO       : index file name to write generated index tree
RECURSE  : when scanning directory recurse into subdirectories
VERBOSE  : display message when something is wrong with scanned file (now
           scanner only yields if file being scanned is inappropriate type,
           I'll improve it later)
KEEPEMPTY: if scanned file contains no references keep it in file list
           instead of removing (which is default)
KEEPFNDEF: for C header files there is often a #define at the beginning of
           file which defines current filename of being already included
           (e.g. #define DOS_DOS_H for dos/dos.h file). Default is that
           GenIndexIQ removes that define from reference list, this option
           turns off that behaviour.
GUI      : open GUI. If there were files given for scanning and this option
           specified, then GUI will be open AFTER completing scanning of
           all files.

!WARNING!  If  scanning  files  without GUI it is possible to break scanning
with  Ctrl-C,  but if scanning with GUI it's impossible (this will change in
future).  After  Ctrl-C  scanning stops after completing scanning of current
file.

@node Usage "Not everyday usage"

GUI  module  uses  BGUI for creating and maintaining GUI (this may change in
future,  as  I  think  about  building  my  own  layout  engine for GadTools
gadgets), and ReqTools for file and EZ requesters.

All stuff contained here in this package was brought to you by

                     Radoslaw Chyra (Chyras/NegativeIQ)

I'm  a  23  year old student at Wroclaw University. I study Computer Science
and now I'm trying to finish my third and fourth year (together :) At home I
use  Amiga1200  self  made Tower with 540 MB harddisk. I also own Pentium PC
box,  but  the  only thing I use there is Linux and appropriate programming,
TeXing,  etc.  stuff.  MS-DOS,  Win***s  and  similar suck. Definitely suck.
Although it's my opinion :)

I  started with my first computer Amiga 500 back in 1987. I coded some demos
in assembler under the name of PEPSI Drinkers Inc. Then I moved to coding OS
compliant software (still in assembler) and together with Grzegorz Calkowski
(UncleMat)  we  formed Beet Development Group. Now I programm under the name
of NegativeIQ which is two-person programming team. Second member is Szeryf,
who is PC owner.

@node Technical "Technical info"

For  scanning  purposes  in  GenIndexIQ  I  used  Flex  release  2.5 scanner
generator, first versions of GenIndexIQ used also Bison 1.24 grammar parser,
but I removed it, reducing code size (although complicating Flex scanner).

GenIndexIQ generates sorted AVL tree to minimize search time (which is now
O  (log n)). It may consume some much amounts of memory, for example Include
references  took  for  me about 450 kB! Anyway, you can always split this to
two  or  more  files,  GetRefIQ  accepts  multiple  index  files,  of course
references found in every next file WILL be added to sorted list.

GenIndexIQ  and  GetRefIQ  were  programmed on Amiga1200T with KS3.0 and 2MB
chip memory, using SAS/C 6.56, Flex 2.5, RCS 5.6.0.1 and Cygnus Ed 3.5.

GenIndexIQ was tested on:
  Amiga 500 with 0.5MB chip and 2 MB Slow equipped with KS2.04
  Amiga 1200 with 2MB chip and KS3.0
  Amiga 1200/Blizzard 030/50 2MB chip and 8MB fast with KS3.1
