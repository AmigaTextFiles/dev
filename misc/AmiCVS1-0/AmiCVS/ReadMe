What is CVS?
------------
  CVS is a software version control system for program sources and
  binaries. It is built on top of the RCS package extending and
  simplifying it. Therefore you need an installed RCS package. CVS can
  be used from shell or GNU Emacs with the PCL-CVS package.


Additional required stuff
-------------------------
  As mentioned before, CVS is built on top of RCS in a way that it
  calls the RCS executable programms. You need a version of the RCS
  package, e.g. HWGRCS the well ported RCS package for Amiga by
  Heinz Wrobel.

  To recompile the cvs program, you need a C compiler (e.g. gcc 2.3.3)
  and yacc (e.g. bison 1.21) when changing the file AmiCVS/lib/getdate.y.


Contents of this package

Installing the package
----------------------
 ∑ This file gives only brief hints to the ported cvs package using
   the sample files. For more information:
     on CVS see AmiCVS/dok/cvs.guide in this package,
     on PCL-CVS see AmiCVS/dok/pcl-cvs.guide and
     on RCS see README.guide in your RCS package if you're using HWGRCS.


 ∑ First, install the RCS package. Supposing you're using HWGRCS no
   further installation than copying the package to GNU:hwg-rcs8 is
   neccessary. You may choose another location and adapt the file
   pathes latter.
   

 ∑ Choose a place for the package and copy the files. On my system
   there is a symbolic volume GNU: where AmiCVS is located: GNU:AmiCVS.

 ∑ Choose a place for the repository and copy the whole tree
   AmiCVS/Repositiory to this place. It is a well idea of security to
   select another partition than your common work partition!

 ∑ Include the file AmiCVS/s/user-startup.add into your s:user-startup
   and adapt the path entries matching your system if you have choosen
   other ones.

 ∑ Copy the libraries AmiCVS/libs/#? to Libs:
   *** Beware that you don't replace newer versions ***
   *** of this libraries if they already exists! ***

 ∑ Copy the file AmiCVS/rexx/CollectLog.cvs to Rexx:

   
 ∑ If your're using the GNU emacs editor you can install PCL-CVS with
   the following steps:

 ∑ Append the file AmiCVS/emacs/.emacs-add to your s:.emacs

 ∑ Copy the tree AmiCVS/emacs/lisp-adds to GNUemacs:lisp-adds

 ∑ Adapt the path entries in the file
   GNUemacs:lisp-adds/user-lisp-pcl-cvs-settings.el matching your 
   system if you have choosen other ones. This requieres
   byte-compiling this file after doing the changes: type
     "M-x byte-compile-file".

   
 ∑ Now, you have to reboot to activate the changes in your s:user-startup.


Limitations and remarks
-----------------------
  ∑ The cvs program needs a stack of 50.000 to 100.000 bytes to run
    reliable. Otherwise you'll get enoying error messages like
    "floating point exception" or the system may crash!

  ∑ Due to the fact that cvs is compiled with gcc, the GNU C compiler,
    and HWGRCS is using SAS C some problems exists with path names.
    Please don't set the environment variable CVSROOT to directly to a
    volume name!

  ∑ Be aware that the programs comes from Unix systems. This causes
    some unexpected behavior of the programs dealing with file names.
    On Unix systems file names are case sensitiv on Amiga not.
    For example:
      "cvs ceckout cvsroot"
      ;this works well nevertheless the module is named CVSROOT

      "cvs release cvsroot"
      ;this fails due to the unknown module name

      "cvs release CVSROOT"
      ;this fails due to the wrong directory name


  ∑ The original sources of cvs package version 1.3 residing in the
    GNU locations had to be adapted (using gcc version 2.3.3):
      - the installation procedure don't match the amiga system,
      - the makefiles aren't able to run,
      - some configuration in src/config.h had to be done,
      - there occured an compilation error in cvs.h.

  ∑ The original sources of pcl-cvs version 1.05 and the contribution
    comming with the editor xemacs are merged to get a complete
    PCL-CVS package running on the GNU emacs, version 18.58, Amiga
    port 1.26DG. They had to be adapted due to several unix specific
    things. See AmiCVS/emacs/user-lisp/pcl-settings.el and
    AmiCVS/emacs/pcl-cvs/pcl-cvs for more details.

Thanks
------
  I wish to thank all the people involved with the CVS stuff,
  namely and in alphabetical order:
  
    Brian Berliner and Jeff Polk for CVS,
    Per Cederqvist for the emacs mode pcl-cvs and the cvs texinfo documentation,
    David Gay for the Amiga port of GNU emacs,
    Markus M. Wild for the Amiga port of gcc,
    Heinz Wrobel for the Amiga port of RCS
    
  All of them wrote great stuff making this package possible!
