RelocSort 37.1:

    This is a program that will sort all your reloc tables. The problem is that
SAS/C, given the exact same source, will generate exactly the same CODE and
DATA hunks in an executable, but can produce the RELOC table entries in a
different order. Technically the program is the same, however if to separate
compiles of the same program need to be compared, they may not seem to be the
same. The problem is not with slink, it is to do with the code generation phase
of compilation. Its command line interface is:

    FROM/A,TO/A,VERBOSE/S

    FROM is the name of the executable to sort. TO is where it is to go to.
They may be the same file name. The VERBOSE option will have RelocSort print
out hunk information as it parses it.

    This program does NOT support overlay hunks. It does not even skip them
properly.

    No other bugs known. I take no responsibility for any damages resulting
directly or indirectly from using this program.

    C source is available from me - just ask.
