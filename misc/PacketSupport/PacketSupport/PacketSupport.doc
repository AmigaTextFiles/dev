    Packetsupport.lib
    -----------------

    This is a tiny little link.lib to support synchronus dos packet
    sending. It is intended to be used with Lettuce C V5.04, but it should
    be simple to port it to any less sophisticated tool :^} Source is
    included.

    The routines are loosely based on an very old packet doc I found on
    Fish 6? by Carolyn Scheppner.

    Use in whatever you want, on your own risk :^D

    The functions:

	sendpacket(struct MsgPort *deviceproc,
		   long ACTION_what?,
		   long arg1,arg2,...arg7);

	Will send a StandardPacket with type ACTION_what? to the device
	process deviceproc (can be obtained by a call to DeviceProc(name))
	with the arg1, arg2 set (you can cut of the number of args) and
	return the dp_Res1 field (or 0 if anything went wrong)


	getres2()

	Will return the dp_Res2 field of last packet send via sendpacket()


	dosinhibit(char *devicename,
		   long what)

	Will send the packet ACTION_INHIBIT to the deviceproc of device
	"devicename" (e.g. "DF0:") with dp_Arg1 set to what. Inhibit will
	prevent DOS to access a specified device any longer if what = TRUE.
	If what = FALSE, access will be allowed and DOS will act as if a
	disk has been inserted (can be used to force a DOS diskchange).

	Note1: dosinhibit() SHOULD be used before *ANY* low level access to
	a device (e.g. via "trackdisk.device"), otherwise you can severly
	corrupt disk structures...

	Note2: "devicename" can also be a volume name or anything like
	that.
