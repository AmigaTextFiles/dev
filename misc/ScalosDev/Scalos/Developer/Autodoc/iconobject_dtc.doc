    PURPOSE
	The iconobject.datatype has a special API to work with icons. It makes
	both images , tooltypes and many more available.

    FUNCTION
	The iconobject.datatype has some special method to draw images and
	writing icons. It is also compatible to gadgets methods. You can use
	datatypes.library or iconobject.library to create objects. The icon-
	object.library is much faster.
	After creating an object the gadget.left and gadget.top fields are
	filled with the saved iconposition. The GA_LEFT,GA_TOP,GA_WIDTH and
	GA_HEIGHT tags are ignored. They have to be set after creating the obj-
	ect if you like to change them.
	Before using the IDTM_Draw method you have to use IDTM_Layout. The
	IDTM_Layout method will generate the images and probably changing the
	size. The extgadget.bounds field of the return object hold the position
	and the whole size (including the text) and the position. The gadget
	size infos are only the image size. The size may change after layouting
	if you setup a inneroffset. The gadget.left/top field may be
	IO_NOPOSITION. If you use an iconobject as gadget you don't need to
	layout it, this will be done automatically.
	The textcolor and the drawmode you like have to be set in the rastport
	before drawing.

	CREATING SUBDATATYPES
		OM_NEW
			You have to open the icon and then you should set some
			attributes to the superclass (e.g. Tooltypes). Set the
			position and the size in the gadget struct. If you like
			to have a transparent icon then set the IDTA_Mask_..
			tags before the IDTM_Layout method.

		OM_DISPOSE
			Free your icon.

		IDTM_Layout
			After calling the superclass you can get the
			gadget.gadgetrender and selectrender. These are filled
			with a pointer to a rastport or NULL. Get the
			IDTA_InnerLeft and IDTA_InnerTop attributes and draw
			your image into the rastport. The bitmap in the rastport
			may be a 15/16 or 24bit bitmap. You can use
			cybergraphics.library to access it. Check the
			layout.flags to know which image you should generate.

		IDTM_Write
			Generate a icon from the icon object and write it to
			disk.

		IDTA_Extention
			Set the extention of your icons or NULL if they have
			none.

    NAME
	iconobject.datatype -- root data type for iconobject.

    FUNCTION
	The iconobject.datatype is the super-class of all iconobjects.

    METHODS
	OM_NEW -- Create a new iconobject.

	OM_GET -- Obtain the value of an attribute.

	OM_SET -- Set the values of multiple attributes.

	GM_HITTEST -- Determine if the object has been hit with the
	    mouse. If the image has a mask, the iconobject will check if the
	    click is insite of this mask.

	GM_RENDER -- Cause the graphic to render.

	IDTM_Layout -- layout the iconobject, it *MUST* be used before using the
	               ITDM_Draw method

	IDTM_Draw -- draw the whole icon to the rastport given in the io_draw
	             struct. The gadget flag SELECTED will determinate the if
	             the unselected or selected image will be drawn.

	IDTM_Write -- write the icon to disk

	IDTM_FindToolType -- find a tooltype

	IDTM_GetToolTypeValue -- get a value from a tooltype

	IDTM_FreeLayout -- free the layout. This should be used if you change
	                   the screen. You can use IDTM_Layout after this
	                   method.
