The smart, small and efficent desktop replacement is now FREEWARE!
Development has not ceased.  Check http://www.scalos.com

This archive contains development material for creating programs that
take advatage of Scalos features. The development kit contains include
files for the 'C' and 'E' langauge, along with FD and Autodocs so you
may also use alternative languages to access the power of Scalos.

Please note that it is currently a work in progress snapshot of the
development kit, but we plan to clean up the 3rd party development side
of the Scalos distribution once the main Scalos desktop is bug-fixed a
bit more.

This release (3) features:
  * updated/fixed Scalos includes & FD files
  * added mcpgfx.library includes for completeness
  * added Amiga E modules
Release (2) features:
  * cleaned up all includes and syncronised the function names in all of them
  * support for the VBCC compiler 'inline'
  * corrected all currently known errors in the autodocs
  * added Filetypes.plugins includes

If you wish to discuss any programming/development related subjects
regarding Scalos please join the Scalos mailing list... details can be
found on the website. If you have any specific program language problems
please consult a specific mailing list such as amiga-c@egroups.com (for
the 'C' langauge only!)

Example modules and plugins for Scalos can be found in seperate archives
on the Scalos websites 'Developers' section. Please feel free to browse
and learn/use the code to create more for Scalos!
