MagicSNs Complete PowerPC Amiga Programming Package
===================================================

Well, this package is thought to be used by 68k programmers
who want PPC Support for their future software. I will be
talking about the following themes:

A) Options for people without PPC Hard/Software
B) PowerPC Support in C or C++
C) PowerPC Support in ASM
D) Mixed Binaries
E) Coding PPC Shared Libraries
F) vbcc-WarpOS differences (to StormC)
------------------------------------------------------------

A) Options for people without PPC Hard/Software

Read the File intro.txt

B) PowerPC Support in C or C++

Read the File c.txt

C) PowerPC Support in ASM

Read the File ppctut.guide (Note: Only deals with the Syntax of
StormPowerASM, the syntax of pASM looks different...). Have also
a look at c.txt, some parts of the "C" discussion will also be
interesting for you. (ppctut.guide is mainly a PPC ASM Coding
Tutorial for people who already know 68k ASM).

ppctut.guide does not yet explain indirect data. There are some
differences in indirect data, mainly the XREF-ing of array has to
be changed from:

XREF _array

to

XREF @__array

and the name later changes in usage to this also. For further information,
i advice to read the Docs of StormPowerASM.

D) Mixed Binaries

Read the File mixed.txt

E) Coding PPC Shared Libraries

Read the File libs.txt

F) vbcc-WarpOS - Differences to StormC

Read vbcc.txt

As to my "background":

I am a student of computer science, shortly before finishing with
studying, and an Amiga-fanatic of the first hour (started with the
A500 a long time ago...).

Some of my work in the past (all my PPC programs use the WarpOS Kernel,
as i still believe in the Amiga, and WarpOS is very closely oriented
at the current AmigaOS)

- rtgmaster.library (for 68k and PPC)
- ZhaDoomPPC (PPC-Doom-Port)
- WarpView (Imageviewer for 68k and PPC)
- WarpAMP (Port of the AMP MPEG 3 Player to the WarpOS PPC Kernel)
- Crystal 3D (Port of a game-related 3D-Engine)
- formerly author of the "Amiga Texturemapping FAQ"
- "adviser" concerning GFX Boards/PPC of some Amiga game firms
- ppctut.guide (Introduction to PPC Assembly programming)
- FrodoPPC C64 Emulator
- AtariPPC Atari XL Emulator
- Megademo 4 II Port to PPC
- V2600PPC Atari 2600 Emulator
- Virtual Gameboy Emulator Port to WarpUP
