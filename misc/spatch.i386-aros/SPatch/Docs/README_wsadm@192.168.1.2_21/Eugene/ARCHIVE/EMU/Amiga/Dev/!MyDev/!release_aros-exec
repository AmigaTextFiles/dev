Spatch is a tool, that allows you to update an old version of any software
to a better one. All you need is a Spatch executable program and a patch
file (#?.pch) created by the developper of the updated software.

Usage:

The spatch program reads a binary patchfile, applying the changes to
the oldfile, producing an output file, or replacing the oldfile, if
the -o option is not used. A binary patchfile is created using the
scomp program. The spatch program verifies that the patch file format
was one generated by a version of scomp which it understands.

The scomp generated patch files are created in such a way that spatch
can verify a change before applying it, by checking for the existence
of expected bytes at the patch offsets. Also, spatch verifies expected
checksum values and length of the generated output file.

The format for the spatch utility command is:

spatch [-o=<output_file> -p=<patch_file>] <oldfile>

The following options are valid for spatch.

-o  - specify the name of the output file. If -o is not used, the name
      of the output file will be the same as the input file with a
	  suffix of .new appended.
	  
-p  - specify the name of the patchfile. If -p is not used, the name
      of the patchfile will be the oldfile name with a suffix of .pch
	  appended.

In the following example, the patch mypatch will be read, and compared
with the file oldfile. Changes will be applied, producing the new file,
newfile.

spatch -o=DPaint4.6 -pdpaint.pch DPaint4.5

Caution: If the version of the file is not understandable by spatch,
an error will be generated; however, the patch may be partially applied.
The output file should not be the same as the input file, because spatch
does not retain the entire input file in memory before writing the output.
