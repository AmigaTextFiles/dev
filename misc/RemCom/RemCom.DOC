               PLEASE SPREAD THE .DOC, NOT ONLY THE MAIN PROGRAMME!

        INTRODUCTION

                Let's say...

                #1: You HATE to use Search & Replace of any kind. You hate
        to use them whatever the reason for using them is. You hate it and
        you need really good program for replacing comments in your C or
        assembler source instead of using such option(s)...

                #2: You are ALWAYS using something like COPY * PROGRAM.C
        or COPY * PROGRAM.ASM and you really need something to remove your
        comments in source files...

                #3: You love AmigaDOS and you like to start any programme
        under that OS. You (badly) need a programme that will remove the
        comments from your sources under DOS...

                #4: You HATE to go to editor or something like that just
        to remove comments when you are giving your sources to some of
        your friends...

                #5: You JUST love from time to time to start something in
        CLI or Shell that begins with letter 'R'...

                #6: You are a BUG collector. Always starting SHAREWARE and
        PD stuff, finding all the bugs, some of them unknown to the author
        and sending a full report to the author laughing at him very much.

                #7: You love to type something like "DELETE RemCom#?" or
        "DELETE RemCom*" and kill every file connected with RemCom...

                #8: You wish every thing be done easily and quickly.
                
                If you (dear reader) are from the group marked with "#8",
        I welcome you into another great utility program. This will help
        you a lot. At least it helped me very much.
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        WHY REMCOM ??

                Here we are. I needed a program to remove all the comments
        from my source files. As I program in C language, I make them with
        loads of comments.

                I love comments. But, I also have the friends who I love
        to send my sources to. Therefore, I have a problem: how to remove
        my comments fast, because I don't want the others to read my silly
        comments.

                So, RemCom was born! My own tool which can do this kinky
        job. And it works for me quite a good.

                I have been using it quite often. What I wish now is that
        it could be useful for you and I want you to use it. And support
        me if so! :-)

        ARCHIVE CONTENT:

        In archive you got, there are the next files:

            1.  RemCom .......... the main program

            2.  RemCom.DOC ...... the file you are reading

            3.  example.c ....... C file to test RemCom

            4.  example.asm ..... assembler source to test RemCom
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        WORKING CONDITIONS

        Simply, you have something like this...


                int MyFunction(int param)  /* the number of choices */


        ... and after RemCom procedure you'll have this...


                int MyFunction(int param)

        Also, if you give to RemCom this...


                move.l  12(a0,d0.w),d4  ; transfering a mask of the plane1


        ... it should return to you this (if not so, contact me:-)...


                move.l  12(a0,d0.w),d4


                ==>> There are no comments left. Thus, The moto of RemCom
        is: NO COMMENTS!! (really!).
