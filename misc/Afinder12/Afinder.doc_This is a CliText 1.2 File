=============================================================================

This little program is very usefull while cracking programs.

As you proberbly now most monitors has a command named hunt or find ...
it will search for strings,absoulute addresses ....

What this program does is search for relative addresses witch not will work
with the metod above in monitors.

Here is a example:

If you find a subroutine in a game and want to now where it is called from, 
then Afind is perfect it will find all bsr,bcc,lea(pc) .....

Afind is relative an can be loaded in memory everywere there is place for
about 1k. 

A good way of using it is to use Amon and then type [ 50000 Afind.rel 
<Return> to load Afind. When you want to use Afind type j7f000 and then 
click at the gadget to switch back to cli-screen. Then click at cli-screen.
Then you can switch between this screen's if there were many found adresses
(To hell with all papers full of addresses in future cracks!)

* To make the file Afind.rel in amon do as follow:
l Afind <Return> amon then prompt were in memory its loaded
use that address in next statement:
] addr +1016 Afind.rel <Return>
and then you have a relative file to load everywere in memory with amon
command [ <address> <filename> <Return>
