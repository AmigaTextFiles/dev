   the missing interface features for a proper error log handling in GUI. (currently not implemented)

 - catalog strings reworked. (Thanks to Dietmar Eilert)

25.11.2006

 - Added automatic trailing spaces/tab strip to edit menu. (greetings to Otti)
 - changed some requester strings.

26.11.2006

 - Finished implementation of the basic SourceSnoop Feature. Note:
   Still no source modification support yet.

27.11.2006

 - Added missing busy pointers
 - Fixed disabling of SourceSnoop gadgets.
 - Fixed some catalog strings

28.11.2006

 - Improved the "Chars Per Line" (CPL) feature. Lines are no longer split hard
   at the given line number. SimpleCat is checking for \n and spaces to split up
   the line. This may make lines a little shorter than described in CPL argument, but
   that is the price to pay. The result is much more readable and looks quite clean.

   Especialy when used with the new CubicIDE AddOn long requester lines look
   better than ever.

   I made many tests and the stuff seems to work quite perfect. When having very small
   CPL values, where the word length is equal to CPL the code produces some ugly " \"
   lines, but in such case the setup should be fixed and not the export function. :)

29.11.2006

 - reworked the source snoop window once again. Currently not very usable.

30.11.2006

 - added new "quiet" option which rejects all output until warnings or errors.

01.12.2006

 - Finished implementation of the source snoop windows. Label creation needs more fine
   tuning and of course the source code export isn't implemented yet! ;)

02.12.2006

 - Implemented the missing parts of the source snoop feature. Now it's possible to auto
   localize your code by using SimpleCat. Please note that there are a few limitations.

   SimpleCat is not a C/C++ Compiler and doesn't know anything about syntax. It simply
   replaces the strings by the function to retrieve a string:

   Printf("This is a : '%s'\n", args);

   Will be changed into

   Printf( GetString( MSG_THISISA ) ,args);

   But constant arrays will be translated too and may cause trouble if they are global.

   args[] = { "text1", "text2" };

   will be changed into

   args[] = { GetString( MSG_TEXT1 ) , GetString( MSG_TEXT2 } );

   Please note that the function "GetString" is only the default. You can setup an function
   name by using the CS preferences.

03.12.2006

 - Added gadget to define a general label format. e.g. "MSG_%s""
 - Added a gadget to specify the maximum label size.

04.12.2006

 - Added basic escape sequence high lighting.

05.12.2006

 - BUGFIX: Fixed preferences loader.
