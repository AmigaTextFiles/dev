Overview

AddComment is a small Commodity that makes it easy to insert comment boxes
into the source loaded in an editor.

It is designed to be integrated in an development system,
therefore it is a Commodity and it has an ARexx-Host.

It offers three forms, for
Programm Heads, Function Heads and Description boxes.
Standart texts like author, date, version and longer descriptions can be
enterd and formattet as left, center and right.

The communication between AddComment and the editors is done by ARexx, which
makes it necessary that the controlled editor has and ARexx-Host, too.

See also integration tips!


System Requirements

AddComment requires besides OS2.0 a fitting development environment,
which means an arexx-speaking editor, if possible with configurable menus.

Also, ARexx has to be installed and the RexxSysLib must be in Libs:

AddComment has been testet on a A500 with 1MB Chip and 4MB Fast, but
there should not be any problems on other Amigas since AddComment uses
very little memory.


Installation

Simply drag AddComment into a drawer, if you want to have it always running
put it in your SYS:WBStartup drawer.
You also have to write a configuration file.(see below)

Compatibility tests

AddComment was tested with the following editors:
   Edward 1.0, OEd, TurboText, Ed.
Only Ed crashed sometimes after sending him boxes, I don't yet know why.
But who in the world uses Ed?!:-)


Usage


The surface

The control gadgets

   Form:          Toggles between the three forms.
   New:           Deletes all string gadgets und lists.
   Insert:        Sends the current comment box to the editor.
   Insert&Close:  Sends the comment box and closes the window afterwards.
   Cancel:        Closes the window.

The form program head

   Programname:   Titel of the commentbox
   Author:        Author of the sourcecode
   Version:       Version of the sourcecode
   Language:      Used programming language
   Description:   List for descriptions etc.
   Add:           Add a new line to the list
   Del.:          Delete marked line
   Cyclegadget:   Select the setting of the marked line, toggle between
                  L for left, C for center and R for right orientation.

The form function head

   Function name: Name of the function
   List for:      Toggle between parameter and description list
   Add:           see above
   Del.:          see above
   Cyclegadget:   see above

The form description

   Add:           see above
   Del.:          see above
   Up:            Move marked line one up
   Down:          Move marked line one down
   Cyclegadget:   see above

Key controlling

Almost all gadgets have key shortcuts, remarkable at the underlined characters.
The cyclegadgets for the orientation of the list lines can be toggled by
pressing the space bar.
In the form programhead you may jump through the stringgadgets via TAB.

The stringgadgets accept only as many characters as selected via the tooltype
BOXWIDTH, this prevents lines from being cutted at the end.

The menus

The menu Project

   About...    Shows a short info text and the current hotkey
   Hide        Closes down the window
   Quit        Really quits AddComment

The menu Language

   Consists of up to 10 languages defined in the config file.
   One can be selected and the data is used for the build up of the
   boxes.

The menu Editor

   Consists of up to 10 editors defined in the config file.
   After the selection of a editor the window closes and opens again to
   eventually open up on a PubScreen.
   By the way, if a PubScreen cannot be found, the window opens on the
   default PubScreen.


The ToolTypes

The program accepts the following ToolTypes:

   CX_PRIORITY:   sets the priority of the Commodity in the input stream,
                  default is 0.
   CX_POPUP:      YES for opening the window at the start, NO for not.
                  default is YES.
   CX_POPKEY:     valid eventstring for the hotkey, default is ralt rshift a.
   CONFIGFILE:    DOS-Name to the configfile, default is s:addcomment.config
   AUTHOR:        name of the author, no default value.
   BOXWIDTH:      width of the comment boxes including comment sequences,
                  default is 60, good are values between 45 and 75.
   FORM:          selects the form presented at popup, default is 0 (from 0-2).
   EDITOR:        selects the editor from the configfile counting from 0,
                  default is 0.
   LANGUAGE:      selects the language, default is 0.
   LEFTEDGE:      left edge of the window at popup in pixels, default is 80
   TOPEDGE:       top edge of the window at popup in pixels, default is 40


The ARexx commands

The program can be controlled via ARexx in the most essential things.
The Hosts name ist "ADDCOMMENT", below the list of commands:

   command, abbrev.     description
  -----------------    -------------
   popup, pu            Opens AddComment's window or brings it to the front.

   popdown, pd          Closes AddComment's window

   insert, in           Sends the currently active box data to the editor

   closeinsert, ci      Sends the box data and closes the window afterwards.

   programform, pf      Selects the programhead form

   functionform, ff     Selects the functionhead form

   descriptionform, df  Selects the description form

   die                  Removes AddComment from memory

   You may call any command at any state of the window, it doesn't matter
   whether it's open or closed, this causes no problems.


The configuration file

AddComment needs a configuration file to be adjusted to your editors and
programming languages, here is the description of the file format:

Data for the editors

Each editor, that shall be listed in the menu Editor needs an entry in the
configfile like this:

<Editor>          editor's name, appearing in the menu, e.g. Eddie
<PublicScreen>    name of the editors PublicScreen
<ARexxPort>       name of editor's ARexx host
<Return>          ARexx command of the editor for "RETURN"
<Insert>          command for inserting characters
<Line start>      command for jumping to the first character in the line
<Line end>        command for jumping to the last character in the line
<Text start>      command for jumping to the top of the text

AddComment uses the commands in the following order:
When inserting a program head, AddComment sends the commands
   <Text start><Return><Text start>
At each line of text the commands 
   <Line start><Insert><Line end><Return>
are sended.

The commands for Line start and end are only necessary, if the editor doesn't
place the cursor at the end of inserted texts, like e.g. Maxon's Edward.
Instead of the command, there must be a linefeed or a blank line.

Data for the languages

Each language, that shall be listed in the menu "Language" needs an entry
in the configfile like this:

<Language>           language name, appearing in the menu
<start comment>      Characters at the beginning of a comment, e.g. "/*" in C
<end comment>        Characters at the end of a comment if existing.
<frame character>    Character to build the boxes frame of.
<bar character>      Character to build separation lines of.

The characters for end comment are not necessarily needed, but if there
is none, enter a linefeed or blank line instead.

See also the sample configuration file below.


A sample configuration file

This is a typical configuration file with two editors and languages defined.
It is possible to enter comments to the configuration file, therefore the
first character of the line must be '#', and the comment continues to the
end of the line.
If you want to use '#' as a character for e.g. a frame character, you have
to double it. (looks like '##')
The data has to occur in a special order, first, you write the numer of
editor descriptions, then come the editor descriptions, then comes the
number of language descriptions and then the language descriptions themselves.
If a argument like a ARexx command is not supported, write a linefeed or
blank line instead.

AddComment starts also if it cannot find a config file, then it uses ANSI C
as language and Ed as editor.


Integration Tips

AddComment was designed to be easily integrated in a development system.
There are many possibilities for a good integration, here are some hints:

Make the functions of AddComment accessible by menu and hotkeys!

If your Editor has configurable menus, enter following menu items:

MenuItem        ARexx Commands

"Program  Box"  "pf" , "pu".
"Function Box"  "ff" , "pu".
"Description "  "df" , "pu".

Also put these command sequences on function keys, e.g. F8-F10.

Also use the ToolType CX_POPKEY for a harmonic integration of AddComment
to your development environment.


History of AddComment

************************************************************************

To do

I still have some good ideas for new features:

*  An interactive mode, that steps through the program text, popping up at
   every function with the prepared form, only requesting a description
   for the parameters and the functions purpose.

*  A possibility to change the commentbox width online.

*  More ARexx commands for putting text in gadgets, selecting the editor etc.

*  Localisation of AddComment under OS2.1

I'd like to hear more new ideas or improvements from you, this would give
me some motivation to continue the development of AddComment.

Copyrights

AddComment is freeware, use it as often as you like, enter anything in the
gadgets you like, just enjoy it.
Originally, AddComment is only a by-product of a C++-ClassLibrary I'm
develloping for the Amiga, with easy Window-, Gadget-, Port-, Errorhandling
and a lot of more fascinating things.
So AddComment is something like a "guinea pig" of this ClassLibrary, but
it works quite fine and is sometimes useful.
If you think so, too or if you are curious about my ClassLibrary or 
find some bugs or what-do-I-know-what, write me!
