Short:    Source to a graphical blitter toy for programmers

Type:     dev/misc

---------------------------------------------------------------

Blitt as well as its source are released as Freeware with an explicit
NO GUARANTEE for the safety of your precious data - in other words:
don't sue me if your DH0 gets reformatted or Paula screams rape...


This program was written in the Fish-disk days, so please don't flame me
if it doesn't work on your CV3D or PIV equipped A4k - I've not touched
its source since then.  Neither will SAS C v6.58 - it flooded me with
syntax errors when I tried recently.  The IFF handling was done by some
routines found on AmigaLibDisk #185 - old C='s Official IFF Specs.

The executable should be found in this same dir:

Blitt.lha    dev/misc    40K 319+Utility to help blitter-programmers. V1

In any case, some of you may want a laugh - please feel free, and some
may be looking for any example C source to learn from, so thank a certain
intrepid Amiga developer named Hans Gujt for this upload... ;)

Old Programmers never die - they just branch to a new address.
