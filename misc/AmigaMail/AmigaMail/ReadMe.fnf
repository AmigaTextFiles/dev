This material was submitted to me on disk by John Orr, of the Commodore
Amiga Technical Support group (CATS), for inclusion in the library.
Thanks John!

Because it almost completely filled the distribution disk, I archived the
material using lharc and created a script to regenerate the original
distribution disk.
