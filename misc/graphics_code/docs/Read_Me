These are the only 3 systems I have been able to test the code with.  If you get
it working with any other system, DICE, Storm c++, please email me with the new
code so that I can add it to the archive.

I think for the assembler versions you will have to get hold of the original
Amiga includes.  Not sure who now has rights to these.  Perhaps Amiga
Technologies will make developer status free to us poor students :-)<-<

My thanks to CHRISTIAN A. WEBER for the use of the freely distributable IFF
Library included within this archive.  It should be installed if you wish to use
the IFF functions within the code but can be left out.  I include the entire
distribution with this archive.

All comments are welcome but please try and make them constructive.

The code in this archive is Public Domain and is to be used at your own risk.
This code has only really been tested on my A1200.  I would be very sceptical
about running it on anything pre WB 3.0.  If enough people contact me I will
attempt to get it running on older systems.  Or if someone can be bothered
wading through my code and does it for me please e-mail me an updated version. 
Any updates, no matter how minor should go through me.  I like to see how my
code develops when it is outside of my own hands.

If you do end up using it in a commercial or non-commercial situation please
credit me or simply e-mail me telling me what you are using it for. Even if you
think it sucks please e-mail me telling me how to make it better. I currently
have a few ideas to speed up certain areas but don't really have the time to
implement them.
