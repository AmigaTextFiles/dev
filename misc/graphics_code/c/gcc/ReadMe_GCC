After assembling the Graphics_base.s file using a normal amiga assembler it is
necessary to convert it into gcc hunk format using hunk2gcc.
The supplied graphics.o file is not standard amiga and has already been
converted ready to be linked by the gnu linker.

You will need the standard commodore(?) includes to use these routines.

Files:-
Graphics.h                     7958
    Contains the funcion prototype definitions
    Must be included to use the functions.

graphics.o                    10583
    This is the gcc format link file which has to be linked into
    your own code to access the functions.

graphics_base.h                 880
    Contains the structure definitions necessary to use the code.
    Must be included

Graphics_Base.s               58257
    The special C version of the assembler code.
    Coded using Devpac 3.
