This directory contains the assembly language source code for the Graphics_Base
file.  In order to reassemble it or include it in your programs you will need
to get hold of the Exec/types.i include file for the structure definition.

It can be directly included with your assembler files by specifying the
graphics_base.i include file at the top after the exec/types.i file.
The graphics_base.s file should then be included at the bottom.
