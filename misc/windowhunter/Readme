				DISCLAIMER
	I cannot be held responsible if this software destroys the project
you've been working on for the past ten months (years?).  I am very, very,
sorry, but I am also very, very poor :), and if these directions are not
clearly explicit or if this program, by some mishap, trashes you OS some-
how, please report it as a bug, but otherwise, don't hold me accountable.
	No warranty of ANY kind is implied.  (You get what you pay for. :)
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
(Now that the legal stuff's out of the way...)
 
INTRODUCTION
	You've probable already tried running it once (naughty you).  So
what's the point of the program? what's it do? why am I sitting here at
2 am Dec. 23, 1993 doing this?
	The Amiga is a great machine.  Unfortunately, Commodore seems to
have little interest in improving it.  Take a look at our great operating
system!  It was SUPERB for what it did eight years ago! but now, even
WINDOZE cleans up after itself more than AmigaDOS!
	In particular, I'm thinking of when your program stops running.
(This happens to me on occasion.)  Pretty much everything is okay, but
either you forgot to close windows and screens OR the program terminated
abnormally and didn't get around to those routines.
	Unlike AT&T's (in)famous (E)unix Operating System, AmigaDOS won't
clean up the mess.  (E)unix, with which I have had all too much experience,
will reclaim ALL memory!  AmigaDOS will just LEAVE it there!
	So my long-range goal (one of them) is to give AmigaDOS some of this
capability.  Here is the first step.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE:
	When using WindowHunter from WB, double-click on the
"WindowHunter.RunMe" icon.  My compiler is old so I have to go a pretty lame
route.  From CLI, you can simply type in "[PATH:]WindowHunter" where the
optional PATH: is the location of WindowHunter.
 
YEAH, BUT WHAT DOES IT DO?
	WindowHunter corrals all system screens.  Then it presents you
with a list of the buggers.  Any of 'em you want to mess around with, select
it from the list.  For example, one possible display (if you run the
enclosed "Bad" program first, which neglects to close its screens and
windows) is:
		0> WorkBench Screen
		1> Bad Screen
	   Which screen? _
at which point you press either 0 or 1.  If you decide you like 'em both,
you can type a larger number (say, 2) and the program will close up nicely.
	Note that, because memory is often trashed once one quits messing
around with a program, the title may be different.  For example, the above
may actually be:
		0> Amiga Workbench  831000 graphics mem  184
		1> fÀ
	   Which screen? _
Quite clearly, the screen you want to get rid of is #1.  Getting rid of the
workbench isn't a good idea unless a window you want to delete is on the
workbench.
	Once you've selected a screen, the next idea is going ahead and
getting rid of ALL the windows on it or none at all:
 		Delete entire screen? (Y/N) _
If you've selected the Workbench, clearly we press N here.  Otherwise, it's
up to your discretion.  Pressing 'Y' will delete both the screen and any
window(s) on it, SAFELY! :)
	If you only want to delete one window, you are presented with a list
of windows:
		0> Bad Window
		1> Bad Window
(Again, the title may not even be there, depending on what's happened since.)
You may choose any window you like.  If you are as poor programmer as I and
name all your windows the same, you get the confusion you deserve.

	Well, that takes care of it.
	Oh- if there are no windows on a screen you've selected, the program
assumes you want to delete the screen, so it does that without warning.
 
FINAL NOTES:
	Can you believe it? for all the hoopla, that's ALL IT DOES! but I
don't like resetting my Amiga, so I like to reclaim memory this way.
	This is CARDWARE.  Send me a card if you like it.  Send me a card
if you don't, and tell me why.  Then do whatever you want with it, except for
malicious purposes!
	This software is freely distributable.  Copy it, share it, I don't
care.  Shoot; it'll make me happy!
 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
	The LORD, for giving me the ability.
	My parents, for starting me off on this route with a TRS-80 Color
Computer.  I've been obsessed ever since.
	Dr. Job at Marymount University, for teaching me thought.
	AT&T, for Eunix. ;-)
	C= (ugh) for Amiga (YES!!!).
	Niklaus Wirth, for Modula-2.  Finally: a READABLE, POWERFUL
programming language!
	TDI Software, Inc., with whose compiler this was developed.  Too bad
it's only for WB1.2.  I will eventually buy Benchmark's and immediately
rewrite everything... :-(
	Microsloth for being there to beat up on... :) :) :) !!!
