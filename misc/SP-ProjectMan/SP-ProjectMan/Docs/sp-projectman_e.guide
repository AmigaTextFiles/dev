@{b}The SP-ProjectMan concept @{ub}

   SP-ProjectMan is a program that's intended to maintain coherancy of common
sources files between programmers working on different projects.

   The programmers could work on the same workstation, on different workstations
of the same kind, or even on different workstation with heterogenous operating
systems.

   This program is definitely not as complete as SCCS or other project management
tools. However, it was designed to be easily @{"portable" Link "MISC_PORTABILITY"} under any operating
systems and through any LAN software.It only needs to have file and directory
access and also simple file protection capabilities. It doesn't use links nor
multiuser control.

@endnode

@Node "INTRO_SYSREQ" "SP-ProjectMan.guide/INTRO_SYSREQ"

@{b}System requirements @{ub}

   SP-ProjectMan requires version 3.0 of the Amiga operating system or higher.
It should work on version 2.1, but has not been tested so far.

   Minimum screen width : 640 x 400 with the XHelvetica/13 font.
Topaz/8 font needs a wider screen.

   @{"MUI 3.0" Link "ACK_MUI"} or higher.

   Any Amiga compatible computer with enough RAM and HD space for real software
developpement. I remember those funny days of 1987 when I was programming
some small Modula-2 programs on a 512K A1000 with a single floppy drive and
no HD at all. Disks swaps about every ten seconds. :-))

@endnode

@Node "INTRO_INSTALL" "SP-ProjectMan.guide/INTRO_INSTALL"

@{b}Installation @{ub}

   SP-ProjectMan is distributed with a standard Installer script.

   As SP-ProjectMan is intended for programmers, only the EXPERT user level has
been implemented. The pretend mode is not implemented yet. You don't need to be
an expert. The installation procedure is extremely simple.

   The script is localized in english and french. It detects automatically the
user's prefered language.

@endnode

@Node "MISC_PORTABILITY" "SP-ProjectMan.guide/MISC_PORTABILITY"

   SP-ProjectMan is currenlty supported only on the Amiga.

   There were command based versions of release 0.9 for PC and MAC. No further
   developpement is under work nor planed unless there is a real interest from
   many registered users.

   Porting it to UNIX should not be a problem, but that has not been done yet.

@Node "UNREG_LIMITS" "SP-ProjectMan/UNREG_LIMITS"

@{b}Unregistered limitations     @{ub}

   If you don't have a registration key, you will face some limitations in the
usage of SP-ProjectMan. These limitations may change from release to release.

   For release 1.00, The limitations are:

   -  3 projects per site.
   - 20 files per project
   -  5 locked files per project

   Theses limitations have been tuned to enable you to evaluate SP-ProjectMan.
However, it will not be practicable to use it for big projects without being
registered.

   Of course, registered usage is limited only by disk and memory space.

   When any of the limitations is reached, a registration window opens. Believe
me, it is really irritating. The best you have to do is to register right now.

@endnode

@Node "GUIDE_START" "SP-ProjectMan/GUIDE_START"

@{b}Files organisation     @{ub}

   SP-Project-Man organises your projects files in two categories:
References files and programmers copies.

   The references files constitutes the "official release" of the projects files.

   The programmers works on copies of the references files. Basically, the
programmer's copy of a file is read-only. If a file to be edited, it must
be locked by a project. When locked, the lock owner's copy becomes writable.
After edition, the reference file is updated from the programmer's copy. The
copies of the other projects are marked as obsolete. they must be updated
from the reference.

@{b}Getting started       @{ub}

   SP-ProjectMan may be started from CLI or from the workbench. It doesn't need
any parameter or tooltypes. The stack size is ajusted internally. The user
doesn't need to worry about that parameter.

   The program opens a window with a three pages register group. The project
page is shown by default. This page is divided in six groups of lists and
buttons: Programmers, projects sites, projects, subprojects, references sites
and references.

   Just after software installation, all the lists are empty.

@{b}Editing the programmers list     @{ub}

   The Programmers group enables to personalize projects. Only projects related
to the current programmer are listed. The projects list is updated even while
editing the programmer's name.

   You may add the current programmer name by pressing <CR> in the string gadget
or by clicking on the "New" button.

   To select a programmer name, open the popup list and select in the list.

   To remove a programmer name, select it and click on the "Remove" gadget.

@{b}Managing sites     @{ub}

   For different reasons, mainly security, the references and programmers
projects should not be stored at the same location. Ideally, they should reside
on different disk drives, or even better, on different computers. Don't worry,
I don't follow this rule myself. But your are advised to have a better practice
than me! :-)

   The references files are grouped in references sites and programmer's
projects in projects sites. You must create at least one site of each, but you
may create more of them if this makes sense for you.

   A site is described by its name (something meaningfull) and its path.

   To add a site, type its name in the string gadget just under the list.
As soon you typed in the first character, the "New" button is enabled.
When you press the <CR> key or click on the "Add" button, a file requester opens
to select the path. The site is created after the path selection.

   To remove a site, just select it and click on the "Remove" button. Note
that the content of the site is entirely preserved. you may add the site again
if needed.

   References are linked to the projects by their site name. Therefore, you
should not change the name of a reference site if it is already referenced
by any project.

   Once you have created at least one project site and one reference site, you
may create references, projects and subprojects.

@{b}Creating a first reference     @{ub}

   References are in fact the last "release" of a sub project. Some references
will be used by a single project, others will be shared by almost all of your
projects.

   To create a reference, type its name in the string gadget just under the
list. As soon you typed in the first character, the "New" button is enabled.
The reference is created after pressing the <CR> key or clicking on the "Add"
button.

   As long as a reference is empty, you may delete it. Just select its name and
click on the "Delete" button. In the current version, the "Delete" button is
activated even if the reference is not empty. This bug will be fixed in a
following version. However, if you try to delete a non empty reference, nothing
happens.

@{b}Creating a first project     @{ub}

   To create a project, type its name in the string gadget just under the list.
As soon you typed in the first character, the "New" button is enabled. The
project is created after pressing the <CR> key or clicking on the "Add" button.


   As long as a project is empty, you may delete it. Just select its name and
click on the "Delete" button.


@{b}Creating subprojects     @{ub}

   To add subprojects to a project, drag and drop references from the references
list to the subprojects list. You may also drop the selected references on the
"Include" button. A third possibility is to select the references and click on
the "Include" button.

   It is possible to delete a subproject as long all the references' files are
new, masked or deleted by the project.

@{b}Working with a project     @{ub}

   You may now select your project to work with. Double click on it in the
list or press on the "Use" button. The "Files lists" page of the register group
is automatically shown. This page contains five lists. If your subprojects are
not shared with other projects, all lists are empty. Four more lists are
contained in the "More file lists" page.

@{b}Including files to the project     @{ub}

   There is two ways to add files to a project: Create a new file and import
files from outside of the SP-ProjectMan data structure.

   Creation of a new file is done by clicking on the new "New" button
associated with "Locked files" list. A window opens showing the list of current
project's subprojects and a string gadget. Select the subproject you want to
create the file in and type the file name in the string gadget. Then click on
the "OK" button to create the file. The file is automatically locked for
modification.

   If you managed to have files in the subprojects directories that are not
part of the subproject, you may include them.

   To include files in a project, select some of thoses shown in the
"Unregistered files" list (Import page) and  press on the "Add in project"
button after files selection. They will be directly locked for modification.

   The files included in the project appear in the corresponding list and
disapear from the "Unregistered files" list. They will also appear in the
"New files" list of the other projects sharing the same subproject reference.

   By including a file in the project, SP-ProjectMan puts a copy of the
programmer's file in the reference directory tree.

@{b}Adding files to the project     @{ub}

   To import files from outside of the project, you must use the special
directory list (Import page).

   First select a subproject. The files will be added to it.

   Then select the files to add in the directory list and press on the
"Add to project button". The files are copied to the subproject's directory
as they are added to the project.

   To navigate though the directories, you should use the "Volumes" and "Parent"
buttons. The "Volume" button display the list of all mounted volumes. The
"Parent" button goes up one directory level.

   To enter in a subdirectory, doubleclick on its name.

@{b}Exporting files from the project.     @{ub}

   The operation to export files outside of the SP-ProjectMan environnement
should unfortunately be made manually. You must copy the desired files from the
subproject directory.

   The subproject directory is:
      "YourProjectsSitePath/Projects/YourProjectName/YourSubprojectName/"

   An file exporter feature is planned for next release of SP-ProjectMan.

@{b}Lock a file for modification     @{ub}

   To make a file editable, you have to lock it. Select the files to lock and
drop them on the "Locked files" list. You may also press on the "Lock" button
after files selection.

   For each file to lock, a window opens, asking you to explain what
modifications you are planning to make to this file. This is part of the
computer assisted documentation features of SP-ProjectMan. You have to type at
least one character in the @{"TextField" Link "ACK_TEXTFIELD"} gadget. To add to your motivation :-),
you have to know that the programmer's name is automatically added with your
comments in the documentation file.

   Once a file is locked, the programmer's copy is made writable, therefore
editable. SP-ProjectMan guarantees that only one project at a time has a given
file writable.

   The locked files are removed from the "Lockable files" list and added to
the "locked files" list. They are also added to the "Other locked files" list
of the projects sharing the same reference files.

@{b}Edit a file     @{ub}

   To edit a file, double click on it in the "Locked files" list. You may also
press on the "Edit" button after file selection. An AREXX script analyses the
file name and selects the editor tool according to the file type. This AREXX
script is easily @{"customisable" Link "MISC_CUST_EDIT"} to adapt at your prefered editors. As default,
the Commodore (Oups! Amiga Technologies) .. (Oups again! Viscorp?) ...
(Amiga Inc! Yeaaaah!) ED text editor is called.

@{b}Unlock a file without retaining modifications     @{ub}

   If you decide that the modifications you made to a file are just bullshit,
select the file in the "Locked files" list and drop it to the "Lockable files"
list. You may also press on the "Restore" button after file selection.
SP-ProjectMan will open a requester asking you to confirm that the
modifications made to the file should be thrown away.

   If you confirm by pressing on the "OK" button, SP-ProjectMan replaces your
local copy of the file by the reference one. The file is made read only again.

@{b}Unlock a file and modify the reference copy    @{ub}

   In fact, your modifications are not bullshit at all, but are good enough
to be used by all other projects sharing the same reference. Then, select the
modified files and press on the "Modify" button.

   For each file to modify, a window opens, asking you to explain what
modifications have been to this file. This is part of the computer assisted
documentation features of SP-ProjectMan. The @{"TextField" Link "ACK_TEXTFIELD"} gadget contains the
text introduced when the file was locked. You have to modify this text by
typing at least one character. To add to your motivation :-),you have to
remember that the programmer's name is automatically added with your comments
in the documentation file.

   By pressing on the "OK" button you confirm the modification of the file.
The reference copy is replaced by the one in the programmer's directory. This
last one is made read only. The file name is removed from the "Locked files" list
and added in the "Lockable files" list. Moreover, it appears also in the
"Obsolete files" list of the other projects sharing the same reference files.

@{b}Masking unused files     @{ub}

   When more than one projects share files, every project doesn't use all the
shared files. Therefore, usnused files may be masked for some projects. To mask
one or more files, select them and press on the "Don't use" button. This could
be made from the "New files", "Obsolete files", "Lockable files" or
"Other locked files" lists. It is also possible to drop them on the
"Masked files" list from the "Other locked" list.

   Masked files are removed from the list they were selected and added in the
"Masked files" list. The programmer's copy of the file is deleted.

@{b}Deletion of files     @{ub}

   Eventually, some files have no more reasons to exists. They may be removed
completely from the database and all copies of them deleted. However, as this
is an irreversible action and needs a consensus from all the programmers, files
are never directly deleted. They may be proposed for deletion instead.

   To propose a file for deletion, it seems obvious that a programmer's doesn't
use it. Therefore, the file should be masked at first. Then, select the file in
the "Masked files" list and drop it in the "Deleted files" list. You may also
press the "Delete" button after file selection.

   The file proposed for deletion is removed from the "masked files" list and
added to the "Deleted files" list. It also appear in the "Other deleted files"
list of the other projects sharing the same reference files.

   By looking at the "Other deleted files", you may know what files are proposed
for deletion by the other programmers. If you agree with the proposition, you
should propose the file for deletion too. When the file is proposed for deletion
from every project, the file is automatically removed from the database and
deleted from the reference directory.

@{b}Using new files      @{ub}

   As said before, files added to a project will appear in the "New files" list
of the other projects sharing the same reference. To be able to use these files
from the other projects, their programmers should select them from the
"New files" list and drop them on the "Lockable files" list. They may also
press on the "Use" button after file selection.

   The files are removed from the "New files" list and added to the
"Lockable files" list. A read only copy of the file is put in the programmer's
directory from the reference.

@{b}Using again masked or proposed for deletion files      @{ub}

   Masked and proposed for deletion files may be usable again the same way. You
have to select them and press the "Use" button associated with the list.

@{b}Updating obsolete files     @{ub}

   When files has been modified in a project and these modifications applied to
the reference, they appear in the "Obsolete files" list of the other projects
sharing them. Your project may be updated by selecting obsolete files from the
"Obsolete files" list and dropping them on the "Lockable files" list. It's also
possible to press on the "Update" button after files selection.

@{b}Displaying the content of files    @{ub}

   From all lists but the "Locked files" list, it is possible to show the
content of a file. To do this, double click on the file to display. You may also
press on the "Show" button of the associated list after file selection. An AREXX
script analyses the file name and select the editor tool according to the file
type. This AREXX script is easily @{"customisable" Link "MISC_CUST_SHOW"} to adapt at your prefered file
viewers. The default tool is Multiview.

@{b}Displaying the modifications history of files    @{ub}

   From all lists but the "Unregistered files" list, it is possible to show the
modifications history report of a file. To do this, select the file(s) to
show the modifications history report and press on the "History" button of the
associated list.

   For every file to show the history report, a window opens containing a
scrollable text field with the previously recorded modifications reports.

   History reports windows openend from the "Locked files" list contains a
second scrollable text field for the modifications under way.
