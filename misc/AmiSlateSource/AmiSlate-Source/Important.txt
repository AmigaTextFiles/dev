 In this archive there is the source remains of a fine program called AmiSlate
 by ( Jreremy Friesner - jaf@lcsaudio.com ) He has given me permission to do
 something with this source code. He is also the author of another fine program
 called AMarquee1.48. He is not on his Amiga any longer, but I am sure he would
 like to here from you if you find this source code of any use.. or even if you
 don't. :) The rest of the source code has been lost.:-/ The latest version and
 hopefully not the final version was released on Aminet in 1996 under the path:

 comm/tcp/AmiSlate1.4.lha "Net paint & games v1.4 for AmiTCP and AS225".readme;-)


 The contents in this archive are not complete, and may require rewriting.
 However, most of the source code is included, but not all of it. Maybe
 there is enough here to do something with... maybe not.

 I realy like this program, however, I am not a programmer, but maybe one of you
 guys in this nice Amiga commiunity could acualy find this source of some use.=)

 My name is ( Kevin Hansen - kevoa@bellsouth.net ) if you wish to contact me for
 any reason, then please do. Look over this source to see what it may become.

Kind Regards, Kevin H.!
