; $VER: BuildIndices 39.2 (25.7.95)
; by Bruce M. Simpson <bsimpson@touchdwn.demon.co.uk>
;
; This script requires two other scripts, GenIncludeIndex and DoIncludeDir.
; Build include file indices according to pattern and directory.
;
; The scripts also require a working Pipe command, a pipeable sort (PSort),
; List, Copy and Delete to be present in your command path.  The PIPE:
; handler must also be mounted.
;
; It is recommended that the above commands be made resident, or else this
; script will take rather a long time indeed.
;
; You should reconfigure this file to suit your own environment.
;
; If the HTML argument is specified, indices are built in HTML format
; instead of AmigaGuide.
