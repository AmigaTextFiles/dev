    V1.xx

    AllocMaster is the ultimate controller of ram allocations (wasteful
    ones, anyway). The initial inspiration for this thing came from Nick
    Sullivan's 'Reserve' article in Amiga Transactor V2.1 p. 64. I've
    added:
        1. a useful & complete Intuition interface;
        2. complete control over Chip and Fast memory wasting;
        3.  - yes, this includes partial freeing;
        4. a memory-availability snapshot feature.

    As noted in the article mentioned above, testing applications in low-
    memory situations is very important. Using AllocMaster, it is possible
    to control the amount of both Chip and Fast memory. The user determines
    the amount of system memory by adjusting AllocMaster's proportional
    slider gadgets.

    One major difference between AllocMaster and 'Reserve' is that Alloc-
    Master will not put the system into a no-memory situation unless 
    so directed: IT DOES NOT NORMALLY ALLOCATE ALL AVAILABLE MEMORY.
    Reserve allocates all system memory and then frees the amount actually
    requested. AllocMaster is smart enough to never touch 'Free' memory.

    Memory Wasting:

        The main intent of AllocMaster is to steal memory (legally) from the
    system so others cannot use it. AllocMaster presents a slider gadget for
    both classes of system memory; Chip and Fast. With each gadget, the
    amount of memory available is displayed in black on the left, and the
    amount of memory stolen is displayed in red to the right. These are
    K-values (1024, NOT 1000!!!). Approx. every second, AllocMaster
    determines the amount of memory available, updating values in needed.
    If AllocMaster is holding any memory, the position of the slider gadget
    will be updated to reflect the relation between the amount held and the
    amount available.
         Memory can be taken from, or returned to the system by positioning
    the slider knobs. Sliding the knob to the right takes memory from the
    system; sliding to the left returns memory to the system. Note: When the
    amount of memory held is to be decreased, version 1.xx returns all memory
    to the system and re-allocates.


    Snap Shot:

        This feature was tacked on late in the evening 'cause I thought
    it would be VERY handy. As many will recognize, the idea was stolen
    directly from Commodore's Drip command. I'm SOOOO tired of loosing/
    gaining 336 bytes (loading the command from disk) that it has shown up
    in AllocMaster; But, this one reports differences in Chip and Fast
    memories individually!

    The SnapShot gadgets front registers for storing the amount of memory
    currently available. Second and subsequent activations display any
    difference from the previous values. If the value remains constant,
    the 'OK' message is displayed in black, otherwise the loss/gain is
    displayed in red.

    Version 1.16 adds two 'delta' gadgets, one below each SnapShot. These
    report differences from the SnapShots above without modifying the
    internal register. Restating the differences: the 'SSn' gadgets check
    the current memory availablity against thier last values, and then
    update the registers. The 'dn' gadgets display differences with the
    associated registers, but do not modify them.


    The rest of it ...

    AllocMaster may be distributed [for non-comercial purposes only] by
    anyone and everyone AS LONG AS the following conditions are met:

        1. The executable and documentation remain together and unchanged;

        2. The program, and any use thereof, be proclaimed to be independent
        and un-associated with any political, religious, or social assoc-
        iation or organization unless its use is detrimental to the goals
        and intent of that body in general. In clarification, this may be
        use by any computer user for any purpose (the restriction will
        probably be met anyway).
