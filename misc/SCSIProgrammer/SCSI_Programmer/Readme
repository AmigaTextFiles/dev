            First in a series of SCSI related programming aids.
            ---------------------------------------------------

This directory contains include files for those of you wishing to program
SCSI devices. This initial release only contains the operation codes for
ANSI SCSI-2 Standard.

To install:

             copy include TO INCLUDE: ALL

A future release will contain more SCSI-2 related include files. At the
moment the CD-ROM section is under development. Sequential devices will
be next. Of course, all of this depends on feedback I receive from users
and the amount of free time I get to work on this.
