render.library
-----------------------------

  render.library is an amiga shared library that serves an image
  processing kernel. it is an interface between truecolor and chunky
  graphics, and it supports all amiga-specific pixel and color schemes.
  render.library provides palette-management, histograms, alpha-channel
  processing, color reduction, scaling, rendering, dithering,
  texture-mapping, and many conversion and support functions.
  
  Compared to earlier releases, no functional changes have been made.
  This upload unifies the different released archives into a single
  distribution. Source included, along with a simple vasm build
  script.
  

requirements
-----------------------------

  - mc68020 or better
  - kickstart 2.04 (v37) or better


installation
-----------------------------

  Just copy the proper library from the libs subdirectory
  to libs:  and rename it to render.library. The naming
  of the builds refers to optimizations targeting specific
  processors.

  minimum CPU/FPU requirements of provided builds
   render.library            - 68020/68030+, no FPU usage
   render.library_68040      - 68040+ with FPU
   render.library_68060      - 68040+ with FPU
   render.library_68060NOFPU - 68040, no FPU usage
