This is a program to remove comments from header files and other source
code.  Using it on your include directories can save a considerable amount
of hard disk space, and also make your programs compile faster.

Blank lines and white space at the end of lines are also removed.

HeadShrink should work on any Amiga (but that doesn't mean it will ;-)

@node DISTRIB "Distribution"
@toc MAIN
HeadShrink is copyright ©1997 Dan Rhodes.  It may be copied, used and
distributed subject to the following conditions:

 1) It may only be distributed together with this document.
 2) If the program is modified in any way, the changes must be described in
    this document, and the user must be informed on running the program
    that it is not the original version.
 3) No charge may be made for the supply or use of this program.  In the
    case of distribution on disk or CD, a charge may be made for the media
    itself, provided such media is at least 90% full.

Source code is available on request.

Use of HeadShrink is entirely at your own risk.  Complaints of loss of data
will be treated with the contempt they deserve (the whole point of the
program is to REMOVE information from files - it goes without saying that
you should have a backup of your header files before running HeadShrink!).
In no event shall the author be liable for loss or damage arising as a
result of using HeadShrink.

@node USAGE "Usage"
@toc MAIN
HeadShrink must be used from the shell or other command line (or
ToolManager, DOpus etc.). There are two ways to use HeadShrink, both using
the following format:

@{i}HeadShrink [-options] <from> <to>@{ui}

<from> and <to> should both be files or both be directories.

To operate on a single file, specify the path of the file as <from>, and
the path of the shrunken version you'd like to create as <to>.

To operate on a whole directory, specify the path of the directory as
<from>, and the path of the destination directory (which may or may not
already exist) as <to>.

Warning: Do NOT specify the same path for both <from> and <to>.

The allowed options are as follows:
   -c	Remove C style comments.  These are comments beginning with /* and
	ending with */ which may span multiple lines.

   -p	Remove C++ style comments.  These start with // and continue to the
	end of the current line.

   -a	Remove assembly style comments.  These start with ; or * and
	continue to the end of the line.  Comments starting with * are only
	recognised if the * is the first non white space in the line.  Note
	that this option works with AmigaDOS scripts too.

   -q	Quiet mode.  Only errors are output to the console.

   -r	Recursive scan.  This only applies when processing directories, and
	means that subdirectories will also be scanned.  The directory tree
	will be recreated in the destination directory.

Options can occur anywhere on the command line, and can be combined, eg.

HeadShrink -cpr old_include new_include -q

will quietly remove all C or C++ style comments from the files in
old_include, and put the new versions in new_include.

@node FUTURE "Future Improvements"
@toc MAIN
I intend to add wildcard support to HeadShrink, so that you could specify
only to act on files matching #?.h for example.
