About DigiConverter v1.0 by Deniil 715!

This program is used to convert numbers between
decimal, hexadecimal, binary and a string of four
characters according to the 4 bytes in the internal
32bit long-variable.

It doesn't change anything in a file or something,
just as you type one kind of a number in the GUI
you will get the other three types displayed.
