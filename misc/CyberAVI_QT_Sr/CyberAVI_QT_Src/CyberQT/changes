     2-Sep-97   - when doing playback on public screens the animation's filename
                  is displayed in CyberQT's window instead of "CyberQT"

    28-Sep-97   - added option CMAP to allow use of external color palettes
                  (especially for dithering)

     8-Oct-97   - fixed bug with own palette for 8bit animations. graphics/
                  intuition don't seem to like colormaps with 247 colors.
                  Strange...

    29-Okt-97   - added support for Motion JPEG type A animations (mjpa)

    21-Nov-97   - added option SCREENMODEID to select a screenmode via command
                  line instead of requester or BestModeID(). Requested by Robert
                  from Poland (sorry, I don't know you second name :)

    20-Jan-98   - fixed a very bad bug in the IMA ADPCM decoder when using
                  frequencies higher than 28kHz on a screen that allow only
                  28kHz maximum
                - Argue 1.4 is now included in CyberQT's archive, because for
                  some unknown reasons it has been deleted from Aminet and many
                  people asked me to include it.
