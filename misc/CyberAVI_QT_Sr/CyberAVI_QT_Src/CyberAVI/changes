    16-Aug-97   - improved recognition of truncated files. Due to a bug in
                  asyncio 39.1 the file has to be reopened to avoid seek errors.

    28-Aug-97   - CyberAVI now handles files with wrong audio header chunk
                  sizes. This lead to seek errors before.

     1-Sep-97   - added a workaround for wrong saved animations by MainActor
                  1.55. This program does *real* nonsense! Thanks to Béla
                  Schramm for the hint.

     2-Sep-97   - when doing playback on public screens the animation's filename
                  is displayed in CyberAVI's window instead of "CyberAVI"

    11-Sep-97   - fixed a bug that lead to crashes due to senseless size
                  information for AVIs with just one huge audio sample
                - found a new type of YUV 2:1:1 animations. I don't know if it
                  is correct but I named them "Component Video (YUV2) Type B",
                  because they coded are almost exactly the same as normal YUV2
                  animations.

    27-Sep-97   - added support for YUV9 video encoding with 9 bits (although
                  this is really 16 bits)
                - added support for YUV12 Planar MPEG video encoding. Thanks to
                  Zer0-X <zrx.oms@sci.fi> for these files.

    28-Sep-97   - added option CMAP to allow use of external color palettes
                  (especially for dithering)

    11-Nov-97   - fixed endless audio playback for one-sample-animations in loop
                  mode

    21-Nov-97   - added option SCREENMODEID to select a screenmode via command
                  line instead of requester or BestModeID(). Requested by Robert
                  from Poland (sorry, I don't know you second name :)

    20-Jan-98   - improved recognition of one-sample-animations a bit, but this
                  is still not bullet-proof
                - Argue 1.4 is now included in CyberAVI's archive, because for
                  some unknown reason it has been deleted from Aminet and many
                  people asked me to include it.
