 CyberQT is @{bold "Freeware". You don't need to send money or anything else (but if  you
 @{uline "really"}  want to I won't stop you from doing that :). But I would be glad if you
 send @{"me" link "contact" 0} an EMail if you like CyberQT.

@node background
@title "Development background"

 The main reason to develop CyberQT was because I was not very pleased with  the
 existing  programs  to  view  QuickTime  animations. Although Marcus Comstedt's
 program QT works very well with graphics boards and CyberGraphX,  it  has  some
 big  disadvantages.  Before  playback the whole animation is decoded. By this a
 very precise timing  during  playback  is  archived,  but  the  animation  must
 completely  fit  in  your  machine's  memory.  Therefore  the  maximum  size of
 animations is limited by the free memory. Additionally it takes  quite  a  long
 time to decode an animation with "just" 10MB size, even with an MC68060!

 So I began to program CyberQT. Development upto now (V1.0) took just @{bold "two weeks"}.
 This  is  because  I  could reuse big parts of CyberAVI (my program to view AVI
 animations) and because Apple  provides  a  @{bold "very  good"}  QuickTime  file  format
 specification.  I  wish I had something similar from Microsoft while developing
 CyberAVI.


 CyberQT was developed on:
   - A4000 with CyberStorm MK2 with MC68060/50
   - AmigaOS 3.1
   - 2MB ChipRAM
   - 16MB FastRAM
   - FastLaneZ3 SCSI-Host (disk capacity about 1.3GB)
   - CyberVision64 with 4MB graphic memory
   - Philips 17B 17" monitor

@node requirements
@title "Requirements"

 minimum hardware requirements:
   -Amiga with AmigaOS 3.0 (V39)
   -MC68020
   -graphic board with CyberGraphX (eg. CyberVision64, Picasso II, Retina, etc)
    or AGA chipset
   -2MB of FastRAM, 512K of ChipRAM


 software requirements
   -CyberGraphX 2.21 or higher (if used with a graphic board)
   -asyncio.library V39 (included)
   -garbagecollector.library V3 (included)


 recommended hardware requirements:
   -Amiga with AmigaOS 3.1 (V40)
   -MC68040 at 25MHz minimum
   -graphic board with CyberGraphX 2.21 or higher



 I recommend a registered version of CyberGraphX since the unregistered  version
 doesn't support 24 bit screenmodes.

@node install
@title "How to install??"

 Just use the supplied installer script.

 If you are very experienced you  can  install  CyberQT  "by  hand".  Just  copy
 asyncio.library and garbagecollector.library to LIBS: and copy CyberQT to where
 ever you want to. I recommend to use the installer script.

@node encodings
@title "Supported encodings"

 CyberQT's implementation of QuickTime decoding is based on the source  code  to
 Mark Podlipec's @{"XAnim" link "xanim" 0} program.
 I will add more decoders as I need them and get any animations to test them.

 Supported encodings until now:

     MACE 3:1      8 bit Mono/Stereo
     MACE 6:1      8 bit Mono/Stereo

 I am still looking for other encodings.  Please  @{"contact  me" link "contact" 0}  if  you  have  an
 animation with one of the following compressions:

   Video:
     - KPCD (Kodak PhotoCD)
     - or any other unsupported format, except "Intel Indeo"


   Audio:
     - µ-Law
     - or any other unsupported format

 You can send me any animation with one of the above compressions. Just compress
 it (with e.g. LhA) and send it uuencoded to one of my @{"EMail" link "contact" 0} addresses.

 My worst problem is to support the @{"Intel Indeo" link "faq" 0} codec. Intel charges  $5000  (in
 words:  five  thousand  US-Dollars)  for  a licence to their source code. So it
 seems to be impossible that Indeo is ever supported :(

@title "Shell Parameters"

 The command template for CyberQT is...

    FILES/M,PUBSCREEN/K,SCREENMODEREQ=SMR/S,SCREENMODEID=SMID/K,FORCE24/S,
    GRAY=GREY/S,AGA/S,HAM8/S,DITHER/S,CMAP/K,BUFFERSIZE=BUF/K/N,DELAY/K/N,
    LOOP/S,MAXFPS/S,NOINDEX/S,NOSOUND/S,NOVIDEO/S,SKIP/S,MAGNIFY/K/N,STATS/S,
    QUIET/S,DEBUG/S



 FILES          One or more QuickTime files you  want  to  view.  If  you  don't
                specify  a filename an ASL file requester will pop up to let you
                choose one or more animations. Wildcards, like ?, #? or  *,  are
                allowed.


 PUBSCREEN      This options forces playback to a window  on  a  public  screen.
                Both  the screen and the animation must have at least a depth of
                15 bits. If this screen does not exist or  if  the  screen's  or
                animation's  depth is lower than 15 bits or CyberQT will use its
                own screen.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option only works with CyberGraphX!
                    If you have CyberGraphX V3 (at least rev 41.9) you  will  be
                    able  to  display  colormapped  animations (8bit or less) on
                    truecolor screens, too.  This  is  NOT  possible  for  older
                    revisions or CyberGraphX 2!


 SCREENMODEREQ  Enables screenmode requester. If the screen is to be opened  for
                playback  you  can choose a screenmode here. This requester will
                appear @{uline "everytime"} CyberQT tries to open a screen.


 SCREENMODEID   This option forces use of a particular  screen  mode.  By  doing
                this  you don't need to select a mode via requester. The ID must
                be given as a hexadecimal number that starts either with "0x" or
                with "$". (i.e.: 0x21000, $40120001)

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    It will @{bold "not"} be checked if it really  possible  to  show  the
                    animation with this mode. For example, if you want to view a
                    24bit  animation  with  the  mode  0x29804   (PAL:   HighRes
                    Interlace  HAM),  this will only succeed if you also specify
                    the HAM8 option and you machine is able to show this mode.


 FORCE24        Forces 16 bit animations to be displayed on  a  24  bit  screen.
                This may increase playback speed a bit.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    If CyberQT is  running  on  a  non-CyberGraphX  system  this
                    option is totally useless and will be ignored.
                    This option only works for 16 bit animations.
                    For 8 bit animations this option will be ignored!!
                    For 24 bit animations this option is (of course) senseless.


 GRAY/GREY      This switch will set a grayscale palette instead of  the  normal
                color  palette.  This  may  speed up playback, because less data
                have to be transfered.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option is mutual exclusive with HAM8 and DITHER!


 AGA            Enables AGA support. This options doesn't need to  be  specified
                if  you don't own a graphic board. CyberQT will recognize itself
                if either AGA or CyberGraphX is available. It is just  meant  to
                @{uline "force"}  playback  on AGA if you want. If this option is specified
                or only AGA chipset is available all frames will be  reduced  to
                256 colors without doing any dithering, just color reduction.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    Do not expect too much from AGA support. AGA chipset is damn
                    slow  compared  to recent CyberGraphX compatible boards. And
                    since there are still some bugs in OS3.x's  graphics.library
                    display may look corrupt on AGA screens.


 HAM8           Forces playback of truecolor animations (16 bits or more)  to  a
                HAM8  screen.  This  may  result in better looking pictures, but
                playback speed will slow down!

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option only works with AGA!
                    This option is mutual exclusive with GRAY and DITHER!


 DITHER         This option enables ordered dithering  of  truecolor  animations
                instead  of  just  simple  color  reduction.  This may result in
                better looking pictures, but playback speed will slow down!

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option only works with AGA!
                    This option is mutual exclusive with GRAY and HAM8!


 CMAP           Here you can specify the filename of a palette file (like PPaint
                and  DPaint do save them). The contained color data will be used
                instead of the standard palette. This option only  takes  effect
                with animations with 16 or 24 bits and AGA display enabled (with
                or without dithering).

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    iffparse.library V37 is required for this!


 BUFFERSIZE     This  option  sets  the  buffersize  for  asynchronous  reading.
                asyncio.library allocates @{uline "two"} buffers of the given size! Default
                value is 64K per buffer. The given value has to be between 1 and
                4096.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This value is interpreted as the given amount of  blocks  of
                    1024  bytes.  So  a value of 50 means 51200 bytes and NOT 50
                    bytes!!


 DELAY          CyberQT will wait the given amount of seconds before  displaying
                the  first  frame.  This  is  very  useful  if  you  have a slow
                synchronizing monitor,  so  you  don't  miss  a  few  frames  at
                beginning  of  the  animation.  Default  value is 2 seconds. The
                given value has to be between 0 and 10.


 LOOP           Enables looping of the animation when it finishes.  The  default
                is to exit at the animation's end.


 MAXFPS         Set playback speed to maximum possible. In fact  a  delay  of  0
                seconds  per  frame  is  set,  so  there  won't be any delay and
                playback will be as fast as your machine can do.


 NOSOUND        Disables sound playback. Only the video frames will be shown.


 NOVIDEO        Disables playback of the video frames. If the animation also has
                audio frames these will be played alone. If the animation has no
                audio frames nothing will be done.


 SKIP           This option enables skipping of video chunks if  playback  speed
                is too slow.


 AUDIOPRELOAD   This option enables decoding of audio sample ahead of  playback.
                If  you  have  an animation with non-interleaved audio and video
                data and enough free memory you can set this option to avoid big
                seeks on your harddisk that may lead to asynchronous playback.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option is @{bold "very"} memory intensitive. If  you  don't  have
                    enough free memory playback will fail. CyberQT uses any free
                    memory to decode the audio samples, so it is not limited  to
                    the amount of free ChipRAM.


 MAGNIFY        This option sets a scaling factor for the display window's size.
                Possible  values ust be between -4 and +4. Negative values cause
                smaller display,  positive  values  cause  bigger  display  than
                normal.  no additional scaling. You should not set higher values
                than 2, because CyberGraphX gets really slow with factors  of  3
                or 4. Values of 0 or -1 also cause no scaling.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option  only  works  with  CyberGraphX  and  on  public
                    truecolor  sceens! It has no effect when playback is done on
                    an own screen.


 STATS          This option causes some statistical information to be  displayed
                after  playback.  This  will  include  the number of frames, the
                number of displayed frames, expected  playback  speed  and  real
                playback speed.


 QUIET          This options will switch off all message printing. This does not
                affect error messages!


 DEBUG          Enables debug mode. When switching debug mode  on  CyberQT  will
                print  much stuff to the output window describing the work being
                done.



 @{bold "Attention!!"} The following combinations of options are illegal  and  will  cause
 one option to be switched off:

   - AGA and PUBSCREEN   (AGA is switched off)
   - HAM8 and PUBSCREEN  (HAM8 is switched off)
   - HAM8 and GRAY       (GRAY is switched off)
   - DITHER and GRAY     (GRAY is switched off)
   - DITHER and HAM8     (HAM8 is switched off)
   - NOVIDEO and NOSOUND (NOVIDEO is switched off)




 @{bold "Examples:"}

   CyberQT blabla.mov

     This will just show blabla.mov with sound (if supported).


   CyberQT blabla.mov nosound maxfps

     This will show blabla.mov @{uling "without"} sound and at maximum possible speed.


   CyberQT blubb.mov screenmodereq buffersize=128

     This will show blubb.mov, but before playback starts CyberQT will  ask  you
     for a screenmode. A buffersize of 128K is used for reading.


   CyberQT brabbel.mov delay=5 loop stats

     This will show brabbel.mov with  a  delay  of  5  seconds  before  starting
     playback. The loop option causes CyberQT to restart playback as soon as the
     animation's  end  is  reached.  Playback  can  be  aborted  by  pressing  a
     mousebutton,  ESC  or  CTRL-C. After playback some statistical data will be
     shown.


   CyberQT veryslow.mov skip quiet gray

     This will show veryslow.mov  without  printing  any  information.  If  your
     machine  isn't fast enough then delayed frames will be skipped if possible.
     A grayscale palette will be used instead of the normal colors.


   CyberQT verysmall.mov magnify 2 pubscreen ThisOne

     This will show verysmall.avi on the public screen "ThisOne" and all  frames
     will be scaled by a factor of 2, this means double width and height.

@endnode

@node "operation"
@title "Operation"

 CyberQT will try to show the animation at the correct speed,  but  this  mostly
 depends  on  your machine. Faster processors (e.g. MC68040 or MC68060) and fast
 graphic board will result in more smooth playback.



 To quit CyberQT or stop playback you can do one of the following things:

   - press either mousebutton, ESC or CTRL-D
      This will just terminate playing the current animation and is the only way
      to quit CyberQT if the @{"LOOP" link "shell" 0} option has been specified.
      Aborting playback by pressing a  mousebutton  only  works  if  CyberQT  is
      running  on  its  own screen. When playback is done on a public screen the
      mousebuttons will have NO effect!

   - press CTRL-C
      This will quit CyberQT completely

   - send a Break to CyberQT's task with tools like Scout or XOper
      This is the same as pressing CTRL-C



 During playback you can use the function keys to adjust playback speed:

   F1  - as fast as possible, same as @{"MAXFPS" link "shell" 0} option
   F2  - 1000% of normal speed
   F3  -  500% of normal speed
   F4  -  300% of normal speed
   F5  -  200% of normal speed
   F6  -  normal speed
   F7  -   75% of normal speed
   F8  -   50% of normal speed
   F9  -   20% of normal speed
   F10 -   10% of normal speed

 The real speed you get may differ from the speed it should be, but this depends
 on  you  machine. The faster you machine is, the more exact playback speed will
 be.

@title "Frequently asked questions"

 Q: Why is "Intel Indeo" not supported? Most of my  QuickTimes  are  saved  with
    this encoding!

 A: Intel charges $5000 (or more) for a non-disclosure agreement and the  source
    to their Indeo technology. I am just a student  and  can't  afford  so  much
    money. Now you can imagine?

    Although XAnim supports "Intel Indeo" it is impossible to implement  support
    for  it,  because there are no sources to this decoder, but only precompiled
    modules for various machine. There exists one module for Sun3  (an  old  SUN
    workstation  with  an  MC68020  CPU),  but  this module also cannot be used,
    because it heavily relies on other parts of XAnim.

    The only sollution would be to disassemble this Sun3 module und re-translate
    it  back  to C. But this very disencouraging for a module with ~100K. If you
    are interested to do this job nevertheless, then just  contact  @{"me" link "contact"}.  I  will
    send you all necessary information then.



 Q: CyberQT just plays the animation's sound, but no video. What is going wrong?

 A: Two cases are possible. Either it is  a  an  audio-only  file,  then  it  is
    obviously why you can't see anything, or the video encoding is not supported
    (i.e. Intel Indeo). In the second case only the sound  will  be  played  (if
    possible).  If  you want to know the video encoding, then just start CyberQT
    from a  shell  without  any  parameters  but  the  filename.  All  important
    information will then be printed out to the shell window.



 Q: I have an animation whose video or audio compression is unknown to  CyberQT.
    What can I do?

 A: If this one is NOT an Intel Indeo (see above) animation, then please send it
    to  @{"me" link "contact" 0}.  I  will  try to support that compression in CyberQT's next release.
    Take a look @{"here" link "encodings" 0}  for  which  encodings  are  currently  supported  (or  not
    supported).



 Q: Why does the sound sometimes listen very bad?

 A: Either your machine isn't fast enough to decode the video frames in time and
    so  the  sound  can't  be played correctly, or it is my fault. Sound support
    still is not perfect. You can try the @{"SKIP" link "shell" 0} option to allow skipping of video
    frames if your machine is not fast enough.

    If sound listenes much too slow (eg. voices of women listen like  voices  of
    men)  the  animation's  audio  frequency  is probably higher than 28kHz. The
    Amiga's audio hardware has a limit of 28kHz, if you use screenmode like  PAL
    or NTSC. With doublescanned modes (like DblPAL or DblNTSC) audio frequencies
    upto 56kHz are possible. Try starting CyberQT with option @{"SCREENMODEREQ" link "shell" 0}  and
    choose  a  doublescan mode. If sound is then still listening the same way as
    before CyberQT has a bug :(



 Q: With some of my animations CyberQT  tells  me,  that  the  ".rsrc  fork"  is
    missing. Is there a way to view them nevertheless?


 A: QuickTime animations were originally created on  Apple  Macintosh  machines,
    whose  filesystem  splits  a  file  into  a  data- and a resource-fork. When
    copying such animations the resource fork is often forgotten.  Without  this
    fork  it  is  not possible to view this animation, because the resource fork
    contains  all  important  information   about   the   animation   (encoding,
    resolution, etc).
    Maybe you just forgot to rename the resource fork correctly. It must  either
    have  the  same  name as the animation and must be copied to the ".resource"
    directory, or it must have the extension ".rsrc" or ".rs".
    One example: animation's name is "blafasel.mov"
    The following files are possible to contain the resource fork:
      - .resource/blafasel.mov
      - resource/blafasel.mov
      - blafasel.mov.rsrc
      - blafasel.mov.rs



 Q: CyberQT doesn't display anything or crashes the machine!

 A: Please @{"contact me" link "contact" 0}! It seems you have found a bug in CyberQT.



 Q: CyberQT refuses to work on my A500 with MC68000/7 bought back in 1988! Why?

 A: <sigh>!!



 Q: CyberQT refuses to work on my 200MHz Pentium with Win95?  Should  I  buy  a
    faster processor and more memory?

 A: YOU DAMN IDIOT!!

@title "History"

 @{bold "V1.0:"}

    27-Feb-97   - first release on Aminet



 @{bold "V1.1:"}

    28-Feb-97   - fixed a bug in RPZA decoder with AGA that produced wrong
                  pixels/blocks of pixels
                - fixed "too slow video playback" when video timescale is not
                  equal to anim timescale
                - fixed delayed reaction when changing playback speed

     4-Mar-97   - CVID depth 32 is now supported, too

     5-Mar-97   - added support for IMA4 audio compression. Unfortunately I was
                  not able to test IMA4's stereo part because of no animation of
                  that kind
                - improved handling of multi-track QTs

     6-Mar-97   - implemented SKIP option to skip delayed frames and keep audio
                  playback synchronous.

     8-Mar-97   - fixed sound loop bug when playing more than one animation at a
                  time. Reported by Thomas Börkel and many other people.
                - improved error handling in "out of memory" situations

    14-Mar-97   - added support for KPCD video compression. Thanks to Lars Weigl
                  for his NASA animation.

    15-Mar-97   - fixed bug that made playback stuck because of wrong calculated
                  time offsets

    16-Mar-97   - fixed bug with wrong interpreted elst chunks
                - small speed improvement for KPCD

    17-Mar-97   - hopefully fixed last problems with screenmode selection.
                  eg: 240x300 animations should be shown on a 640x480 screen
                      instead of a 320x240 screen.
                - fixed some skipping problems with "keyframe-only" QTs

    19-Mar-97   - fixed problems with TWOS 16bit stereo sound. SamplesPerChunk
                  entry was misinterpreted as "bytes per chunk" instead of real
                  "samples per chunk", so not enough data were read.



 @{bold "V1.2:"}

    22-Mar-97   - fixed some problems with oversized audio samples, although
                  audio playback may still stumble a bit (happened with trailer
                  to "Aliens 2")
                - added support for PCM0 audio encoding

    23-Mar-97   - window on public screen is now resizeable on special request
                  by Thomas Börkel :)

    28-Mar-97   - fixed bad bug in RAW32 decoder
                - added some frame size checks to avoid crashes with corrupted
                  frames
                - fixed some problems with resource fork recognition
                - fixed some problems with multi video tracks and different
                  encodings
                - BIG speed improvement when converting YUV -> RGB in grayscale
                  mode

    29-Mar-97   - fiddled around with depth selection of animation with mixed
                  truecolor and colormapped encodings. I hope it is correct now.

    31-Mar-97   - did many changes on timing calculations
                - audio samples are now buffered in a queue instead of playing
                  them directly. Thus playback should not stumble anymore if
                  audio and video data are interleaved.

     1-Apr-97   - Sorry, no jokes happened :)

     2-Apr-97   - animations with more audio frames than video frames per second
                  are now played correctly again
                - animations with with very small audio samples (eg. one sample
                  per frame instead of one sample per 5 frames) are now more
                  often played correctly. Playback may still listen bad because
                  of too much overhead with these very small samples.
                - decoding of mono audio samples sped up by using just one
                  buffer instead of two. Two buffers are now used for stereo
                  samples only.

     3-Apr-97   - added option @{"AUDIOPRELOAD" link "shell" 0}, which enables decoding of all audio
                  samples @{bold "before"} playback, to keep playback smooth with slow
                  harddisks or non-interleaved animations.

     4-Apr-97   - fixed bug with PCM0 decoder
                - finally made animations with old style STSC chunk work

     7-Apr-97   - CyberQT now handles samples of ANY size. There is no limit of
                  128K per sample for audio.device anymore.

     8-Apr-97   - fixed bug when animations with and without sound were played
                  within one call of CyberQT (eg selected via requester)

     9-Apr-97   - fixed bug with RLE1 decoder, RLE4 decoder was called
                  accidentially
                - fixed bug with wrong grayscale palette for CVID animations

    10-Apr-97   - fixed bug with TWOS 16bit stereo audio that occured when
                  reading sample sizes
                - changed FPS rate in stats from integers to floats to be more
                  precise

    14-Apr-97   - added option @{"MAGNIFY" link "shell" 0} to allow scaling of the display window on
                  public screens by factors of 1..4

    15-Apr-97   - CVID decoder produced wrong pixel blocks in grayscale mode.
                  This is fixed now.

    20-Apr-97   - CyberQT got a new icon. Much thanks to Bastian Kinne for
                  painting it.

    22-Apr-97   - added option @{"DITHER" link "shell" 0} for ordered dithering with AGA

    25-Apr-97   - optimized checks for corrupted files. Truncated files are not
                  always rejected, but recognized.

     2-May-97   - did some optimizations for RPZA dithering, looks better now

     3-May-97   - hopefully fixed the last elst-chunk problems



 @{bold "V1.3:"}

     6-May-97   - again some fixes for elst data. Who invented this bullshit? :(
                - fixed bug introduced in V1.2 that caused CyberQT to play some
                  animations with maximum speed instead of normal speed. Thanks
                  to Thomas Wenzel for reporting this.

    12-May-97   - IMA stereo decoder was completely broken and caused immediate
                  crashes. This is fixed now.

    15-May-97   - dithering is now available for all truecolor encodings and
                  looks much better than before

    20-May-97   - implemented automatic resampling of audio data, if frequency
                  is >27kHz and no double scanned video mode is available
                - optimizied skipping detection. CyberQT now skips less often
                  than before and produces more smooth playback.

    21-May-97   - audio-only QTs are now played correctly
                - skipping is now (hopefully) perfect and never activated if
                  there is no need to skip

    26-May-97   - some more optimizations for skipping detection

    29-May-97   - complete reworte timing calculation. garbagecollector.library
                  is required now.
                - added support for stereo audio splitted into two mono streams

     2-Jun-97   - displaying colormapped animations (8bit or less) on public
                  truecolor screens is now possible with CyberGraphX 3 (rev
                  41.9 and up). Much thanks to Frank Mariak to implement this
                  function for me :)
                - hopefully last chnages on elst-chunk calculations. All my
                  "problem-movies" are now played 99.99% in time.

    10-Jun-97   - added very simple support for edits to be played multiple
                  times. Currently only one frame is supported.

    16-Jun-97   - very small audio frames are now merged to larger ones if
                  possible to avoid unnecessary overhead on audio.device

    24-Jun-97   - finally managed to implement JPEG decoding. I can't explain
                  why it didn't work before. But be warned: it is DAMN slow.
                  You need at least an MC68060/50 for nearly smooth playback!

    29-Jun-97   - fixed problems with elst data for audio tracks. Only elst
                  data for video tracks where handled before.

     4-Jul-97   - very much thanks to Thomas Wenzel for burning a CD for me.
                  Unfortunately he renamed the ".resource" directory to
                  "resource", so this is now possible for resource forks, too :)

    15-Jul-97   - some small optimizations



 @{bold "V1.4:"}

    10-Aug-97   - added support for MACE 3:1 and MACE 6:1 audio compression

     2-Sep-97   - when doing playback on public screens the animation's filename
                  is displayed in CyberQT's window instead of "CyberQT"

    28-Sep-97   - added option @{"CMAP" link "shell"} to allow use of external color palettes
                  (especially for dithering)

     8-Oct-97   - fixed bug with own palette for 8bit animations. graphics/
                  intuition don't seem to like colormaps with 247 colors.
                  Strange...

    29-Okt-97   - added support for Motion JPEG type A animations (mjpa)

    21-Nov-97   - added option @{"SCREENMODEID" link "shell"} to select a screenmode via command
                  line instead of requester or BestModeID(). Requested by Robert
                  from Poland (sorry, I don't know you second name :)

    20-Jan-98   - fixed a very bad bug in the IMA ADPCM decoder when using
                  frequencies higher than 28kHz on a screen that allow only
                  28kHz maximum
                - Argue 1.4 is now included in CyberQT's archive, because for
                  some unknown reasons it has been deleted from Aminet and many
                  people asked me to include it.

@node bugs
@title "Bugs"

 Known bugs:
   - Memory usage increases when playing more than one animation at a time.
     To avoid this just start CyberQT with only one animation at a time.
   - animations with audio frequency higher than ~28kHz are played much too slow
     due to Amiga's audio hardware. If you have an AGA machine or an ECS machine
     with graphics board you should enable a doublescan  mode  (DblNTC,  DblPAL,
     etc), to allow audio frequencies upto 56kHz.

 If you should find any additional bugs or if you have  any  suggestions  please
 @{"contact me" link "contact" 0} immediately.

 If you should find some Enforcer hits, please report them to @{"me" link "contact" 0}.

 Please include a capture of CyberQT's output when started with the @{"DEBUG" link "shell" 0} option
 if  there  are  any  problems  while playback (eg. black screen, immediate stop
 after start, crashes, etc).

@title "Things to do and future enhancements"

 Very urgent things to to (maybe already finished in the next release):
   - better sound support (will this ever be finished?)
   - support AHI for sound playback. This package offers much easier  access  to
     different types of audio hardware.


 To do:
   - support for more video and audio encodings
   - find more bugs

@node "xanim"
@title "XAnim"

 The QuickTime encodings supported by CyberQT are based on the  source  code  to
 Mark Podlipec's XAnim program. XAnim supports a number of other QuickTime video
 encodings, as well as AVI files.

   The key differences between CyberQT and XAnim for QuickTime files are:

     - XAnim is more powerful and more general than CyberQT.

     - CyberQT requires either a CyberGraphX compatible graphic board or AGA
       chipset. ECS is not and will not be supported!

@title "About Argue"

 It was around 1992 when Commodore released their new Amiga OS 2.0.  With  this,
 there  were  amazing  changes  for  developers and users. All looked a bit more
 professional, and a lot of things were just easy and better to handle  than  in
 former times.

 Earlier, developers had to write their own argument reading  system.  Often  it
 was really unpractically and difficult to understand.

 The guys at Commodore knew that and thought about a new standard  for  argument
 parsing  to  avoid  confusion  about  all  that.  What  they  finally  got  was
 ReadArgs(), a system function that parses arguments automatically.

 Developers now only had to write a template to  specify,  what  arguments  they
 would like to have. A template looks like this: FILE/A,SWITCH/S...

 From now on, all the users could have a look  at  this  template  by  adding  a
 question mark to the program's name to execute.

 But all in all, there was a problem. Folks still had to go "down" into a  shell
 and type in all the arguments by hand.

 So there are still a lot  of  people  that  write  external  interfaces  for  a
 specific tool. Some of them are even shareware!

 This was really annoying as there was no tool that could manage ALL tools.

 In early 1996 I developed a GUI layout system called NiceGUI. It was crap,  but
 on this way I created the first version of @{bold "Argue"}.

 Argue's job was and is to read other tool's argument templates  and  prepare  a
 nice  user  interface  where  the user can decide what he would like to have as
 arguments. Argue 0.3 was quite bad, but it was  the  first  basis  for  further
 development.

 Some months later I invented how to write MUI applications. It was  very  easy,
 and I implemented a new version of Argue with it. This was called Argue 0.6 and
 released to some BBSs here in Germany.

 From then on Argue made giant steps towards user friendliness  and  efficiency.
 New  features were added in masses, and now, at the time of Argue 1.0, there is
 a (near ;) complete interface creation system.
