 CyberAVI is @{bold "Freeware"}. You don't need to send money or anything else (but if you
 @{uline "really"} want to I won't stop you from doing that :). But I would be glad if  you
 send @{"me" link "contact" 0} an EMail if you like CyberAVI.

@node background
@title "Development background"

 The main reason why CyberAVI was developed was because all  existing  animation
 players  for  AVI  files  were either far too slow or didn't support my graphic
 board in the way I wanted. All ports of XAnim  supported  only  very  few  file
 formats and were "optimized" for the original Amiga graphic chipset.

 So I planed to write  such  a  piece  of  software  myself.  Because  I  own  a
 CyberVision64  graphic board it was so easy to support the different file types
 with display depth >8 bits.


 CyberAVI was developed on:
   - A4000/030 (yes, just an MC68EC030 at 25MHz)
     now equipped with CyberStrom MK2 68060 at 50MHz
   - AmigaOS 3.1
   - 2MB ChipRAM
   - 16MB FastRAM
   - FastLaneZ3 SCSI host (disk capacity about 1.3GB)
   - CyberVision64 with 4MB graphic memory
   - Philips 17B 17" monitor

@node requirements
@title "Requirements"

 minimum hardware requirements:
   -Amiga with AmigaOS 3.0 (V39)
   -MC68020
   -graphic board with CyberGraphX (eg. CyberVision64, Picasso II, Retina, etc)
    or AGA chipset
   -2MB of FastRAM, 512K of ChipRAM


 software requirements
   -CyberGraphX 2.21 or higher (if used with a graphic board)
   -asyncio.library V39 (included)


 recommended hardware requirements:
   -Amiga with AmigaOS 3.1 (V40)
   -MC68040 at 25MHz minimum
   -graphic board with CyberGraphX 2.21 or higher



 I recommend a registered version of CyberGraphX since the unregistered  version
 doesn't support 24 bit screenmodes.

 Up from version 1.5 there is support for AGA, but I still recommend  a  graphic
 board  with  CyberGraphX,  because  OS3.x's  graphics.library has some bugs and
 display on AGA is not just slow, it is DAMN slow! Please  don't  blame  me  for
 this...

@endnode

@node install
@title "How to install??"

 Just use the supplied installer script.

 If you are very experienced you can  install  CyberAVI  "by  hand".  Just  copy
 asyncio.library  to  LIBS:  and  copy  CyberAVI  to  where  ever you want to. I
 recommend to use the installer script.

@node encodings
@title "Supported encodings"

 CyberAVI's implementation of AVI decoding is based on the source  code to  Mark
 Podlipec's @{"XAnim" link "xanim" 0} program.
 I will add more decoders as I need them and get any animations to test them.

 Supported encodings until now:

   Video:

     Radius CinePak       (CVID)              8 bit (only gray)
     Radius CinePak       (CVID)       16/24/32 bit
     JFIF JPEG            (JPEG)              8 bit (only gray)
     JFIF JPEG            (JPEG)             24 bit
     Motion JPEG          (MJPG)              8 bit (only gray)
     Motion JPEG          (MJPG)             24 bit
     Microsoft Video 1    (MSVC)           8/16 Bit
     Microsoft RGB        (RGB)    4/8/16/24/32 bit
     Microsoft RLE8       (RLE8)              8 bit
     IBM Ultimotion       (ULTI)             16 bit
     Component Video      (YUV2)       16/24/32 bit
     Intel Raw            (YUV9)     9/16/24/32 bit
     Planar MPEG          (YV12)    12/16/24/32 bit


   Audio:

     PCM        8/16 bit Mono/Stereo
     MS ADPCM      4 bit Mono/Stereo (is really 16 bit)
     DVI ADPCM     4 bit Mono/Stereo (is really 16 bit)

 I am still looking for other encodings.  Please  @{"contact  me" link "contact" 0}  if  you  have  an
 animation with one of the following compressions:

   Video:
     - RLE4 (Microsoft RLE4)
     - XMPG (Editable MPEG)
     - IJPG (Intergraph JPEG)
     - CYUV (Creative Technology CYUV)
     - or any other unsupported format, except "Intel Indeo"


   Audio:
     - IMA ADPCM
     - µ-Law
     - or any other unsupported format

 You can send me any animation with one of the above compressions. Just compress
 it (with e.g. LhA) and send it uuencoded to one of my @{"EMail" link "contact" 0} addresses.

 My worst problem is to support the @{"Intel Indeo" link "faq" 0} codec. Intel charges  $5000  (in
 words:  five  thousand  US-Dollars)  for  a licence to their source code. So it
 seems to be impossible that Indeo is ever supported :(

@node shell
@title "Shell Parameters"

 The command template for CyberAVI is...

    FILES/M,PUBSCREEN/K,SCREENMODEREQ=SMR/S,SCREENMODEID=SMID/K,FORCE24/S,
    GRAY=GREY/S,AGA/S,HAM8/S,DITHER/S,CMAP/K,BUFFERSIZE=BUF/K/N,DELAY/K/N,
    LOOP/S,MAXFPS/S,NOINDEX/S,NOSOUND/S,NOVIDEO/S,SKIP/S,MAGNIFY/K/N,STATS/S,
    QUIET/S,DEBUG/S



 FILES          One or more AVI files you want to view. If you don't  specify  a
                filename an ASL file requester will pop up to let you choose one
                or more animations. Wildcards, like ?, #? or *, are allowed.


 PUBSCREEN      This options forces playback to a window  on  a  public  screen.
                Both  the screen and the animation must have at least a depth of
                15 bits. If this screen does not exist or  if  the  screen's  or
                animation's depth is lower than 15 bits or CyberAVI will use its
                own screen.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option only works with CyberGraphX!
                    If you have CyberGraphX V3 (at least rev 41.9) you  will  be
                    able  to  display  colormapped  animations (8bit or less) on
                    truecolor screens, too.  This  is  NOT  possible  for  older
                    revisions or CyberGraphX 2!


 SCREENMODEREQ  Enables screenmode requester. If the screen is to be opened  for
                playback  you  can choose a screenmode here. This requester will
                appear @{uline "everytime"} CyberAVI tries to open a screen.


 SCREENMODEID   This option forces use of a particular  screen  mode.  By  doing
                this  you don't need to select a mode via requester. The ID must
                be given as a hexadecimal number that starts either with "0x" or
                with "$". (i.e.: 0x21000, $40120001)

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    It will @{bold "not"} be checked if it really  possible  to  show  the
                    animation with this mode. For example, if you want to view a
                    24bit  animation  with  the  mode  0x29804   (PAL:   HighRes
                    Interlace  HAM),  this will only succeed if you also specify
                    the HAM8 option and you machine is able to show this mode.


 FORCE24        Forces 16 bit animations to be displayed on  a  24  bit  screen.
                This may increase playback speed a bit.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    If CyberAVI is running  on  a  non-CyberGraphX  system  this
                    option is totally useless and will be ignored.
                    This option only works for 16 bit animations.
                    For 8 bit animations this option will be ignored!!
                    For 24 bit animations this option is (of course) senseless.


 GRAY/GREY      This switch will set a grayscale palette instead of  the  normal
                color  palette.  This  may  speed up playback, because less data
                have to be transfered.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option is mutual exclusive with HAM8 and DITHER!


 AGA            Enables AGA support. This options doesn't need to  be  specified
                if you don't own a graphic board. CyberAVI will recognize itself
                if either AGA or CyberGraphX is available. It is just  meant  to
                @{uline "force"}  playback  on AGA if you want. If this option is specified
                or only AGA chipset is available all frames will be  reduced  to
                256 colors without doing any dithering, just color reduction.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    Do not expect too much from AGA support. AGA chipset is damn
                    slow  compared  to recent CyberGraphX compatible boards. And
                    since there are still some bugs in OS3.x's  graphics.library
                    display may look corrupt on AGA screens.


 HAM8           Forces playback of truecolor animations (16 bits or more)  to  a
                HAM8  screen.  This  may  result in better looking pictures, but
                playback speed will slow down!

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option only works with AGA!
                    This option is mutual exclusive with GRAY and DITHER!


 DITHER         This option enables ordered dithering  of  truecolor  animations
                instead  of  just  simple  color  reduction.  This may result in
                better looking pictures, but playback speed will slow down!

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option only works with AGA!
                    This option is mutual exclusive with GRAY and HAM8!


 CMAP           Here you can specify the filename of a palette file (like PPaint
                and  DPaint do save them). The contained color data will be used
                instead of the standard palette. This option only  takes  effect
                with animations with 16 or 24 bits and AGA display enabled (with
                or without dithering).

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    iffparse.library V37 is required for this!


 BUFFERSIZE     This  option  sets  the  buffersize  for  asynchronous  reading.
                Default  value  is  64K. The given value has to be between 1 and
                4096.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This value is interpreted as the given amount of  blocks  of
                    1024  bytes.  So  a value of 50 means 51200 bytes and NOT 50
                    bytes!!


 DELAY          CyberAVI will wait the given amount of seconds before displaying
                the  first  frame.  This  is  very  useful  if  you  have a slow
                synchronizing monitor,  so  you  don't  miss  a  few  frames  at
                beginning  of  the  animation.  Default  value is 2 seconds. The
                given value has to be between 0 and 10.


 LOOP           Enables looping of the animation when it finishes.  The  default
                is to exit at the animation's end.


 MAXFPS         Set playback speed to maximum possible. In fact  a  delay  of  0
                seconds  per  frame  is  set,  so  there  won't be any delay and
                playback will be as fast as your machine can do.


 NOINDEX        This switch forces CyberAVI to read the file "as is". Every  AVI
                file can have an optional index describing in which sequence the
                file has to be played. If you set this option the index will  be
                ignored  and  the  animation  will be played in the sequence the
                frames appear in the file.


 NOSOUND        Disables sound playback. Only the video frames will be shown.


 NOVIDEO        Disables playback of the video frames. If the animation also has
                audio frames these will be played alone. If the animation has no
                audio frames nothing will be done.


 SKIP           This option enables skipping of video chunks if  playback  speed
                is too slow. SKIP will only work if the animation's index can be
                used (index available and NOINDEX ist @{uline "NOT"}  specified).  Skipping
                will  be done to the next available keyframe to avoid "humpling"
                of sound. If there is no "next" keyframe and your machine is too
                slow there is no way to play sound correctly.


 MAGNIFY        This option sets a scaling factor for the display window's size.
                Possible  values ust be between -4 and +4. Negative values cause
                smaller display,  positive  values  cause  bigger  display  than
                normal.  no additional scaling. You should not set higher values
                than 2, because CyberGraphX gets really slow with factors  of  3
                or 4. Values of 0 or -1 also cause no scaling.

                @{bold "NOTE:"}
                    This option  only  works  with  CyberGraphX  and  on  public
                    truecolor  sceens! It has no effect when playback is done on
                    an own screen.


 STATS          This option causes some statistical information to be  displayed
                after  playback.  This  will  include  the number of frames, the
                number of displayed frames, expected  playback  speed  and  real
                playback speed.


 QUIET          This options will switch off all message printing. This does not
                affect error messages!


 DEBUG          Enables debug mode. When switching debug mode on  CyberAVI  will
                print  much stuff to the output window describing the work being
                done.



 @{bold "Attention!!"} The following combinations of options are illegal  and  will  cause
 one option to be switched off:

   - AGA and PUBSCREEN   (AGA is switched off)
   - HAM8 and PUBSCREEN  (HAM8 is switched off)
   - HAM8 and GRAY       (GRAY is switched off)
   - DITHER and GRAY     (GRAY is switched off)
   - DITHER and HAM8     (HAM8 is switched off)
   - SKIP and NOINDEX    (SKIP is switched off)
   - NOVIDEO and NOSOUND (NOVIDEO is switched off)




 @{bold "Notes:"}

   The FRAMESPERSEC switch doesn't exist anymore from V1.4 on since there was no
   real reason for its existance. Or does anybody view his AVIs with 2 fps?? :)

   The PRIORITY option doesn't exist anymore from V1.7 on, because all  subtasks
   have been removed.



 @{bold "Examples:"}

   CyberAVI blabla.avi

     This will just show blabla.avi with sound (if supported) . The  index  will
     be used if it is available.


   CyberAVI blabla.avi nosound noindex maxfps

     This will show blabla.avi @{uline "without"} sound and at maximum possible  speed.  No
     index will be used.


   CyberAVI blubb.avi screenmodereq buffersize=128

     This will show blubb.avi, but before playback starts CyberAVI will ask  you
     for  a screenmode. A buffersize of 128K is used for reading.


   CyberAVI brabbel.avi delay=5 loop stats

     This will show brabbel.avi with  a  delay  of  5  seconds  before  starting
     playback.  The  loop  option causes CyberAVI to restart playback as soon as
     the animation's end is reached. Playback  can  be  aborted  by  pressing  a
     mousebutton,  ESC  or  CTRL-C. After playback some statistical data will be
     shown.


   CyberAVI veryslow.avi skip quiet gray

     This will show veryslow.avi  without  printing  any  information.  If  your
     machine  isn't fast enough then delayed frames will be skipped if possible.
     A grayscale palette will be used instead of the normal colors.


   CyberQT verysmall.mov magnify 2 pubscreen ThisOne

     This will show verysmall.avi on the public screen "ThisOne" and all  frames
     will be scaled by a factor of 2, this means double width and height.

@endnode

@node "operation"
@title "Operation"

 CyberAVI will try to show the animation at the correct speed, but  this  mostly
 depends  on  your machine. Faster processors (e.g. MC68040 or MC68060) and fast
 graphic board will result in more smooth playback.

 If you did not specify the @{"NOINDEX" link "shell" 0} option CyberAVI will try to read  the  index
 in every AVI file. This may take a few seconds and  depends  on  how  fast  you
 machine is and how big the animation is.



 To quit CyberAVI or stop playback you can do one of the following things:

   - press either mousebutton, ESC or CTRL-D
      This will just terminate playing the current animation and is the only way
      to  quit  CyberAVI if the @{"LOOP" link "shell" 0} option has been specified.
      Aborting playback by pressing a mousebutton  only  works  if  CyberAVI  is
      running  on  its  own screen. When playback is done on a public screen the
      mousebuttons will have NO effect!

   - press CTRL-C
      This will quit CyberAVI completely

   - send a Break to CyberAVI's task with tools like Scout or XOper
      This is the same as pressing CTRL-C



 During playback you can use the function keys to adjust playback speed:

   F1  - as fast as possible, same as @{"MAXFPS" link "shell" 0} option
   F2  - 60 frames per second
   F3  - 30 frames per second
   F4  - 24 frames per second
   F5  - 15 frames per second
   F6  - 12 frames per second
   F7  - 10 frames per second
   F8  -  5 frames per second
   F9  -  1 frame per second
   F10 - speed specified in AVI file

 The real speed you get may differ from the speed it should be, but this depends
 on  you  machine. The faster you machine is, the more exact playback speed will
 be.

@title "Frequently asked questions"

 Q: Why is "Intel Indeo" not supported? Most of my  AVIs  are  saved  with  this
    encoding!

 A: Intel charges $5000 (or more) for a non-disclosure agreement and the  source
    to their Indeo technology. I am just a student  and  can't  afford  so  much
    money. Now you can imagine?

    Although XAnim supports "Intel Indeo" it is impossible to implement  support
    for  it,  because there are no sources to this decoder, but only precompiled
    modules for various machine. There exists one module for Sun3  (an  old  SUN
    workstation  with  an  MC68020  CPU),  but  this module also cannot be used,
    because it heavily relies on other parts of XAnim.

    The only sollution would be to disassemble this Sun3 module und re-translate
    it  back  to C. But this very disencouraging for a module with ~100K. If you
    are interested to do this job nevertheless, then just  contact  @{"me" link "contact"}.  I  will
    send you all necessary information then.



 Q: CyberAVI just plays the animation's sound,  but  no  video.  What  is  going
    wrong?

 A: Two cases are possible. Either it is  a  an  audio-only  file,  then  it  is
    obviously why you can't see anything, or the video encoding is not supported
    (i.e. Intel Indeo). In the second case only the sound  will  be  played  (if
    possible).  If you want to know the video encoding, then just start CyberAVI
    from a  shell  without  any  parameters  but  the  filename.  All  important
    information will then be printed out to the shell window.



 Q: I have an animation whose video or audio compression is unknown to CyberAVI.
    What can I do?

 A: If this one is NOT an Intel Indeo (see above) animation, then please send it
    to  @{"me" link "contact" 0}.  I  will try to support that compression in CyberAVI's next release.
    Take a look @{"here" link "encodings" 0}  for  which  encodings  are  currently  supported  (or  not
    supported).



 Q: Why is the ECS chipset not supported?

 A: There are some very simple reasons:
    CyberAVI was originally designed just to run on  CyberGraphX  systems  only.
    From  V1.5  on  CyberAVI  will also run on AGA machines and all graphics are
    reduced to 256 colors. AGA chipset is a lot faster  than  ECS  chipset,  but
    access  to  ChipRAM is still very slow. Thus playing AVIs on AGA machines is
    MUCH slower than on CyberGraphX machines, even if you have a fast CPU,  like
    MC68040 or MC68060. Watching AVIs on AGA machines is really no fun. So, what
    would you expect from ECS?



 Q: Why does the sound sometimes listen very bad?

 A: Either your machine isn't fast enough to decode the video frames in time and
    so  the  sound  can't  be played correctly, or it is my fault. Sound support
    still is not perfect. You can try the @{"SKIP" link "shell" 0} option to allow skipping of video
    frames if your machine is not fast enough.

    On the other hand it could be an animation, whose audio samples have  to  be
    played  at  a  frequency beyond 28kHz. If the animation is NOT shown on a so
    called "doubled scanned" screen CyberAVI will  automatically  activate  some
    kind  of  resampling  for the audio data. This means: every second sample is
    ignored and the frequency is divided by 2. The result is that audio  samples
    with  48kHz can be played correctly even without a screenmode like DblPAL or
    Multiscan. Because of this reduction of data you will of course lose quality
    and the resampled samples may listen worse than the original ones, but there
    is no way to change this.



 Q: With some of my animations CyberAVI tells me, that they  are  corrupted.  Is
    there a way to view them nevertheless?

 A: If a part of the animation is missing, then it is the end  of  the  file  in
    most  cases.  Just  try  to  start  CyberAVI  with option @{"NOINDEX" link "shell" 0}, to permit
    reading the index at the end.  But  be  warned:  corrupted  data  can  cause
    crashes!!!



 Q: After playing a huge animation with  index  it  takes  some  time  until  my
    Shell's  prompt  appears  again.  Are  there any bugs when playing such huge
    animations??

 A: Hey, please give Oberon's runtime  system  some  time  to  free  the  memory
    occupied  by  the  index  :) This is definately NO bug and only appears with
    large indices.



 Q: CyberAVI doesn't display anything or crashes the machine!

 A: Please @{"contact me" link "contact" 0}! It seems you have found a bug in CyberAVI.



 Q: CyberAVI refuses to work on my A500 with MC68000/7 bought back in 1988! Why?

 A: <sigh>!!



 Q: CyberAVI refuses to work on my 200MHz Pentium with Win95?  Should  I  buy  a
    faster processor and more memory?

 A: YOU DAMN IDIOT!!

@title "History"

 @{bold "V1.0:"}

    17-May-96   - first release on Aminet



 @{bold "V1.1:"}

    19-May-96   - corrected version string
                  now it should look like "CyberAVI Vx.x (date)"
                - timer checking implemented
                  now playback speed should be the same on MC68030 and MC68060
                - added user adjustable playback speed
                - added startup delay
                - added user adjustable buffersize for asynchronous I/O.

    26-May-96   - added support for RGB and RLE compression
                - small speed improvements

    28-May-96   - playback may now be aborted by pressing any mousebutton
                - reduced CVID memory usage a lot by decreasing maximum allowed
                  strip count from 16 to 4. This may lead to incompatibility
                  with some animations, but I never saw any animation with more
                  than one strip. Please report your experiences with this.



 @{bold "V1.2:"}

    31-May-96   - fixed a bug that caused "memory header not located" gurus
                - again some small speed improvements

     2-Jun-96   - added screenmode requester option
                - added file requester
                  if CyberAVI is called without a filename a requester will pop
                  up for selection



 @{bold "V1.2a:"}

     5-Jun-96   - fixed a bug that caused crashes, when CyberAVI was called with
                  non-AVI-files



 @{bold "V1.3:"}

    10-Jun-96   - added support for 32bit RGB animations
                - raised default buffer size for asynchronous reading to 64K
                - many people complained that CyberAVI did not correctly open
                  its screen. I hope this is fixed now.

    14-Jun-96   - fixed a bug in RLE8 decoding. Thanks to Steve Cutting for his
                  really @{uline "BIG"} RLE8 animation to find this bug.

    16-Jun-96   - seems I have found a bug in MainActors AVI saver. MA saves a
                  buffersize of 0 instead of the correct value. This lead to
                  crashes before.
                - improved sound support. I hope it listens better now.



 @{bold "V1.4:"}

     1-Jul-96   - started to rewrite CyberAVI completely
                  rewrite is really necessary because the source code had become
                  very confusing and weird :)

     7-Jul-96   - why are 00xx chunks used for video data???? Very strange.
                  Much thanks to Maurizio Lotauro for the example animations
                  (swing.avi and baseball.avi).

    11-Jul-96   - rewrite is mostly done and playback should be much more stable
                  now
                - now a subtask is used to decode the video data. This sped up
                  playback speed about 10% on my system. Its priority can be
                  changed with the @{"PRIORITY" link "shell" 0} option
                - fixed a big bug when width or height of a video frame had to
                  to be rounded to multiples of 4 or 8. Former versions did't
                  allocate enough memory, so innocent memory could be over-
                  written while decoding data
                - many minor bugfixes
                - removed FRAMESPERSECOND option since there was no real reason
                  for it (who would play anims at eg. 2 fps??) Therefore the
                  switch @{"MAXFPS" link "shell" 0} was introduced.

    12-Jul-96   - now AVIs will be played "by index". If an index chunk is found
                  it will be used to determine the sequence in that the
                  animation will be played.
                - added @{"NOINDEX" link "shell" 0} switch to force ignorance of the index chunk

    14-Jul-96   - added support for 8 bit RGB anims. Thanks to Joachim Greve for
                  for the example animations.

    17-Jul-96   - improved recognition of chunks. Unknown video chunks should
                  not appear anymore (eg: 00xx, 00id, etc).
                  Thanks to Ingo Jürgensmann for his animation with these strange
                  chunks.
                - added support for startup from Workbench. All ToolTypes should
                  work exactly the same way as the Shell options do.

    18-Jul-96   - added @{"SKIP" link "shell" 0} switch.
                  This allows skipping of video frames if necessary and possible

    27-Jul-96   - fixed problem with shrug display of some animations.
                  Thanks to Manuel Schlegel for his sample animations.
                - removed some MungWall hits
                - disabled audio subtask because of many problems while playback

     1-Aug-96   - I hope all sound problems are fixed now. A big "Thank you" to
                  Thomas Wenzel for his great advice.
                - Wow! I spent 4 weeks on rewriting and cleaning up!! I hope I
                  did a good work :)

     4-Aug-96   - put audio subtask back in, works fine now
                - again found some bugs that could lead to crashes :(



 @{bold "V1.5:"}

    23-Aug-96   - finally got my CyberStrom MK2 with an XC68060/50 :))))
                  GREAT speedup for the whole system :)

    16-Sep-96   - started to support AGA :), but it's more difficult than I
                  thought. But the worst thing is: although I now own an
                  XC68060/50 displaying AVIs on AGA is sloooooooooow :(

    18-Sep-96   - added option @{"AGA" link "shell" 0}
                  This forces use of color reduction routines used for AGA
                  chipset
                - support for 8 bit AVIs on AGA is almost finished
                  SetPatch 43.4 is needed for correct display, without it the
                  display will become screwed up due to bugs in graphics.library

    22-Sep-96   - finished support for AGA :)
                  now it should be possible to show all supported encodings on
                  AGA machines
                - CyberAVI now doesn't depend on audio.device anymore, so it
                  should also run on Amiga's without audio hardware (e.g. DraCo)

    23-Sep-96   - mouse pointer is now invisible during playback
                - functions keys can now be used to adjust playback speed
                - several bug fixes

    25-Sep-96   - completely rewrote synchronization part. Skipping of frames
                  should be better now.

    26-Sep-96   - added @{"STATS" link "shell" 0} option

    27-Sep-96   - rewrote synchronization part again :)
                  now using EClock's instead of TimeVal's, thus timing is much
                  more exact. Now skipping of delayed frames works much better,
                  too. Pooohhhh :)

    29-Sep-96   - removed audio subtask again :)
                  I had some spare time and worked on audio support and I think
                  it now works really good. Because audio data are very small
                  and simple there is no need for an asynchronous audio decoder
                  anymore.
                - when playing animations with palette changes in loop mode the
                  original palette was not restored. This fixed now.
                - added support for PCM 16 bit mono samples
                - fixed a bad bug with PCM 8 bit stereo samples. These were
                  played at half speed before.

    30-Sep-96   - all truecolor decoders have been splitted in a CyberGraphX
                  part and an AGA part. This may improve speed a bit.
                - a colormap is allocated only if needed



 @{bold "V1.6:"}

     2-Oct-96   - added support for ADPCM 4 bit mono samples
                - CyberAVI could hang if playback was aborted very very early.
                  This is fixed now.
                - again removed some problems with sound playback

     7-Oct-96   - SetPatch 43.x is not needed anymore, but it is supported if
                  available. With SetPatch 43.x installed playback is slightly
                  faster, because no additional copy of video data is necessary
                - switching off mouse pointer during playback caused Enforcer
                  hits. Thanks to Alexander Wild for reporting that bug.
                - fixed some bugs when pressing keys without function

     8-Oct-96   - @{"WINDOW" link "workbench" 0} tooltype was not recognized if started from Workbench
                - finished Installer script

     9-Oct-96   - when playing more than one animation with and without sound at
                  a time CyberAVI could do Wait() for non-existing signals which
                  lead to deadlocks. This is fixed now.
                - audio.device became very confused when stopping sound without
                  aborting pending requests. This lead to deadlocks before, too.

    15-Oct-96   - CyberAVI has now an @{"Argue" link "argue"} interface. At least Argue V1.3 is
                  needed.

    16-Oct-96   - again fixed some bad bugs when playing an animation with sound
                  and loop

    18-Oct-96   - added @{"GRAY" link "shell" 0} option for doing playback with grayscale palette

    23-Oct-96   - added some checking when reading the index with corrupted
                  offsets. Thanks to Chris Longmore for his "strange" animations



 @{bold "V1.7:"}

    29-Oct-96   - AGA display routine now uses Peter Kunath's FastC2P algorithm
                  for chunky->planar conversion. This nearly doubled playback
                  speed with AGA!! :)

    13-Nov-96   - again a rewrite became necessary :)
                - video subtask now completely removed, because overhead was too
                  big. By doing this playback speed again raised a bit!
                - as there are no subtasks anymore the @{"PRIORITY" link "shell"} option is
                  obsolete now and has been removed.

    15-Nov-96   - added support for Component Video (YUV2) compression. Thanks
                  to Chris Longmore for his sample animation.

    17-Nov-96   - added support for Intel Raw (YUV9) compression. Note: this is
                  a "hacked" support. It took me nearly one complete day to
                  disassemble the YUV9 part from XAnim's Indeo module.

    18-Nov-96   - added support for PCM 16 bit stereo samples

    19-Nov-96   - improved skipping of delayed frames
                - fixed a small display bug when rounded width or height was
                  different from original value

    20-Nov-96   - added @{"PUBSCREEN" link "shell" 0} option to display truecolor animations on
                  truecolor screens

    21-Nov-96   - removed a Mungwall-Hit that appeared when allocating odd size
                  of memory for video buffer
                - the CVID decoding routine now uses the same YUV tables as YUV2
                  and YUV9.
                  With this change CyberAVI should use the same CVID routine as
                  the most recent version of XAnim. This is a "hacked" part, too.

    22-Nov-96   - maximum possible buffersize decreased to 4096 (which means
                  4MB). I think this is enough.

    27-Nov-96   - some minor speed optimiziations



 @{bold "V1.8:"}

     6-Dec-96   - added support for 8bit gray Cinepak (CVID) compression. Thanks
                  to Arjo Rozendaal for his hint where to find such animations.
                - improved selection of screenmode id, when selection by
                  requester failed because of no suitable screenmodes

     9-Dec-96   - added support for 4bit RGB compression. Thanks to Philippe
                  Reux for his sample animation.
                - now there is also a german documentation

    11-Dec-96   - fixed some bugs when reading palette
                - fixed a big bug in CVID decoder that could hurt innocent
                  memory. Damn that difference between ">" and ">=". This bug
                  existed since the time CyberAVI supported CVID :(

    12-Dec-96   - playback on public screens is not aborted anymore when a
                  mousebutton is pressed

    21-Dec-96   - AGA routines now use an additional TmpRas of 4K. Again approx.
                  DOUBLE playback speed is archived for most animations (on my
                  MC68060)!

     1-Jan-97   - Happy new year, Miss Sophie! :)

     3-Jan-97   - added option @{"HAM8" link "shell" 0} to force playback of truecolor animations
                  on a HAM8 screen with AGA

     4-Jan-97   - some speed optimizations for all decoders. Sometimes upto
                  15fps more (with 68060, compared to V1.7) can be archived!

     6-Jan-97   - Truecolor animations are now rendered much better in grayscale
                  mode with AGA. Now all 256 grayscale colors are used instead
                  of just a few.

     8-Jan-97   - fixed a really bad bug with ADPCM samples, that was introduced
                  with V1.7
                - fixed a bug that could lead to lockups in some situations when
                  sound playback was switched on.

    10-Jan-97   - fixed problems with skipping. Sometimes not enough frames were
                  skipped => garbage in display
                - skipping is now also possible for AVIs where @{uline "every"} frame is a
                  keyframe (eg: RGB, YUV9)

    12-Jan-97   - 15bit screen modes are now also possible for selection. How
                  could I forget this before?

    13-Jan-97   - senseless values for video buffer sizes are now ignored (Sven
                  Ottemann reported this "out of memory" bug)

    19-Jan-97   - option SOUND has been renamed to NOSOUND. Sound playback is
                  now switched on by default.
                - added option @{"NOVIDEO" link "shell" 0} to switch off video playback

    20-Jan-97   - fixed very bad bug with 8bit PCM stereo samples that trashed
                  memory

    27-Jan-97   - CyberAVI crashed when audio.device was unavailable, now fixed.



 @{bold "V1.9:"}

    30-Jan-97   - corrupted animations are now recognized and rejected

     3-Feb-97   - fixed a bad bug with ADPCM samples that produced bad listening
                  sound or even crashes.

     4-Feb-97   - again fixed some audio bugs!! When will this nightmare end??
                - fixed crash with YUV2 animations (wrong buffer size)

     6-Feb-97   - fixed some Mungwall hits
                - sound playback now also works with changed video speed (e.g.
                  MAXFPS) without stocking video

     9-Feb-97   - added support for DVI ADPCM 4 bit mono samples (Intel)

    17-Feb-97   - removed support for SetPatch V43, because now only CyberGraphX
                  calls are used. CyberGraphX3 gives *GREAT* speed improvement
                  with 8bit video!

    21-Feb-97   - fixed a problem with audio-video-AVIs (video-audio is normal),
                  but this is still not perfect

    24-Feb-97   - improved automatical screenmode selection. Sometimes too small
                  modes were selected when animation's dimensions were somewhat
                  strange.

    28-Feb-97   - fixed delayed reaction when changing playback speed

     6-Mar-97   - improved detection of delayed frames. Now there should be no
                  more remaining pixels from former frames.

     8-Mar-97   - improved error handling in "out of memory" situations

    17-Mar-97   - hopefully fixed last problems with screenmode selection.
                  eg: 240x300 animations should be shown on a 640x480 screen
                      instead of a 320x240 screen.
                - fixed some skipping problems with "keyframe-only" AVIs



 @{bold "V1.10:"}

    23-Mar-97   - window on public screen is now resizeable on special request
                  by Thomas Börkel :)

    28-Mar-97   - added some size checking to avoid crashes because of corrupted
                  frames
                - BIG speed improvement when converting YUV -> RGB in grayscale
                  mode

     1-Apr-97   - Sorry, no jokes happened :)

     8-Apr-97   - added some checking for wrong "movi" chunk sizes. Reported by
                  Felix Schwarz. MainActor seems to save f*cking bullshit
                  sometimes.
                - some animations were incorrectly displayed because of wrong
                  decoders for uncompressed frames (eg RLE8 animations with some
                  uncompressed RGB8 frames)

    10-Apr-97   - changed FPS rate in stats from integers to floats to be more
                  precise

    14-Apr-97   - added option @{"MAGNIFY" link "shell" 0} to allow scaling of the display window on
                  public screen by factors of 1..4

    15-Apr-97   - CVID decoder produced wrong pixel blocks in grayscale mode.
                  This is fixed now.

    21-Apr-97   - CyberAVI got a new icon. Much thanks to Bastian Kinne for
                  painting it.

    22-Apr-97   - added option @{"DITHER" link "shell" 0} for ordered dithering with AGA.

    24-Apr-97   - added support for DVI ADPCM 4bit stereo and MS ADPCM 4bit
                  stereo

    29-Apr-97   - finally made animations with only one huge audio chunk work.
                  This requires the animations index.



 @{bold "V1.11:"}

     6-May-97   - fixed again some problems with oversized frames. I wonder
                  which software saves such bullshit :(
                - fixed bug in DVI ADPCM stereo decoder

    15-May-97   - dithering is now available for all truecolor encodings and
                  looks much better than before

    16-May-97   - again found some animations with completely wrong buffersizes!
                  This drives me crazy! Who saves such bullshit??

    20-May-97   - implemented automatic resampling of audio data, if frequency
                  is >27kHz and no double scanned video mode is available
                - optimizied skipping detection. CyberAVI now skips less often
                  than before and produces more smooth playback.
                - fixed one very strange colormap bug. What is wrong with 236
                  used colors instead of 256??

    21-May-97   - skipping is now (hopefully) perfect and never activated if
                  there is no need to skip

     2-Jun-97   - displaying colormapped animations (8bit or less) on public
                  truecolor screens is now possible with CyberGraphX 3 (rev
                  41.9 and up)

    15-Jun-97   - added support for single-frame AVIs with sound.

    24-Jun-97   - finally managed to implement JPEG decoding. I can't explain
                  why it didn't work before. But be warned: it is DAMN slow.
                  You need at least an MC68060/50 for nearly smooth playback!

    29-Jun-97   - fixed division-by-zero problems for animations with no
                  information about keyframes

    15-Jul-97   - some small optimizations



 @{bold "V1.12:"}

    16-Aug-97   - improved recognition of truncated files. Due to a bug in
                  asyncio 39.1 the file has to be reopened to avoid seek errors.

    28-Aug-97   - CyberAVI now handles files with wrong audio header chunk
                  sizes. This lead to seek errors before.

     1-Sep-97   - added a workaround for wrong saved animations by MainActor
                  1.55. This program does *real* nonsense! Thanks to Béla
                  Schramm for the hint.

     2-Sep-97   - when doing playback on public screens the animation's filename
                  is displayed in CyberAVI's window instead of "CyberAVI"

    11-Sep-97   - fixed a bug that lead to crashes due to senseless size
                  information for AVIs with just one huge audio sample
                - found a new type of YUV 2:1:1 animations. I don't know if it
                  is correct but I named them "Component Video (YUV2) Type B",
                  because they coded are almost exactly the same as normal YUV2
                  animations.

    27-Sep-97   - added support for YUV9 video encoding with 9 bits (although
                  this is really 16 bits)
                - added support for YUV12 Planar MPEG video encoding. Thanks to
                  Zer0-X <zrx.oms@sci.fi> for these files.

    28-Sep-97   - added option @{"CMAP" link "shell"} to allow use of external color palettes
                  (especially for dithering)

    11-Nov-97   - fixed endless audio playback for one-sample-animations in loop
                  mode

    21-Nov-97   - added option @{"SCREENMODEID" link "shell"} to select a screenmode via command
                  line instead of requester or BestModeID(). Requested by Robert
                  from Poland (sorry, I don't know you second name :)

    20-Jan-98   - improved recognition of one-sample-animations a bit, but this
                  is still not bullet-proof
                - Argue 1.4 is now included in CyberAVI's archive, because for
                  some unknown reason it has been deleted from Aminet and many
                  people asked me to include it.

@endnode

@node bugs
@title "Bugs"

 Known bugs:
   - Memory usage increases when playing more than one animation at a time.
     To avoid this just start CyberAVI with only one animation at a time.

 If you should find any additional bugs or if you have  any  suggestions  please
 @{"contact me" link "contact" 0} immediately.

 If you should find some Enforcer hits, please report them to @{"me" link "contact" 0}.

 Please include a capture of CyberAVI's  output  when  started  with  the  @{"DEBUG" link "shell"}
 option  if  there  are any problems while playback (eg. black screen, immediate
 stop after start, crashes, etc).

@title "Things to do and future enhancements"

 Very urgent things to to (maybe already finished in the next release):
   - better sound support (will this ever be finished?)
   - support AHI for sound playback. This package offers much easier  access  to
     different types of audio hardware.


 To do:
   - support for more video and audio encodings
   - find more bugs

@node "xanim"
@title "XAnim"

 The AVI encodings supported by CyberAVI are based on the source  code  to  Mark
 Podlipec's XAnim program. XAnim supports a number of other AVI video encodings,
 as well as QuickTime files.

   The key differences between CyberAVI and XAnim for AVI files are:

     - XAnim is more powerful and more general than CyberAVI.

     - CyberAVI requires either a CyberGraphX compatible graphic board or AGA
       chipset. ECS is not and will not be supported!

@title "About Argue"

 It was around 1992 when Commodore released their new Amiga OS 2.0.  With  this,
 there  were  amazing  changes  for  developers and users. All looked a bit more
 professional, and a lot of things were just easy and better to handle  than  in
 former times.

 Earlier, developers had to write their own argument reading  system.  Often  it
 was really unpractically and difficult to understand.

 The guys at Commodore knew that and thought about a new standard  for  argument
 parsing  to  avoid  confusion  about  all  that.  What  they  finally  got  was
 ReadArgs(), a system function that parses arguments automatically.

 Developers now only had to write a template to  specify,  what  arguments  they
 would like to have. A template looks like this: FILE/A,SWITCH/S...

 From now on, all the users could have a look  at  this  template  by  adding  a
 question mark to the program's name to execute.

 But all in all, there was a problem. Folks still had to go "down" into a  shell
 and type in all the arguments by hand.

 So there are still a lot  of  people  that  write  external  interfaces  for  a
 specific tool. Some of them are even shareware!

 This was really annoying as there was no tool that could manage ALL tools.

 In early 1996 I developed a GUI layout system called NiceGUI. It was crap,  but
 on this way I created the first version of @{bold "Argue"}.

 Argue's job was and is to read other tool's argument templates  and  prepare  a
 nice  user  interface  where  the user can decide what he would like to have as
 arguments. Argue 0.3 was quite bad, but it was  the  first  basis  for  further
 development.

 Some months later I invented how to write MUI applications. It was  very  easy,
 and I implemented a new version of Argue with it. This was called Argue 0.6 and
 released to some BBSs here in Germany.

 From then on Argue made giant steps towards user friendliness  and  efficiency.
 New  features were added in masses, and now, at the time of Argue 1.0, there is
 a (near ;) complete interface creation system.
