                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This  short  program is designed for programmers. It may especially come
  in useful for people programming in assembler.

  After  starting,  the program opens a window that contains 32 mx-gadgets
  and  1  string-gadget.  Bool-gadgets  are  numbered  from  0 to 31. Each
  mx-gadget  represents  1  bit.  These gadgets are called 'toggle', which
  means  that  they  can  be  turned  on or off. Turning on (or off) these
  gadgets  results  in  setting  (or clearing) an appropriate bit, and the
  value,  which comes out of setting (or clearing) these bits, is given in
  the string-gadget.

  It  is also possible to enter a requested value (in decimal notation) in
  the string-gadget, which results in the opposite effect.
