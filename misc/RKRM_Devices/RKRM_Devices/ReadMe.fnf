This material was submitted to me on disk directly by Dan Baker of the 
Commodore CATS group, for inclusion in the library.  Thanks Dan!

This is part 1 of a 4 part distribution.  Parts 1 and 2 are on this disk,
and parts 3 and 4 are on disk 742.  Because of its size, I've left it
archived in it's original form.  You can use the :c/lha program included
on this disk to dearchive the files.
