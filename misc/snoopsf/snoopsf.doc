- What is does
"snoopsf" is short for "SnoopSetFunction". This is a little utility
to let you watch programs patching your system libraries. As you know
(if you don't, you probably won't need this tool anyway :) ),
exec.library contains a function to patch your own code into any
library, called SetFunction(). "Snoopsf" intercepts this function and
pops up an requester whenenver a program patches a library, informing
you about what library is about to be patched and the offset of the
patched function.

- What it doesn't do
snoopsf currently only gives you the library vector offset of the
patched function, not the function's name. Later maybe :)
It also doesn't inform you about patches not done via SetFunction.
Some programs (including snoopsf) patch libraries by writing directly
to the library's jump table. There's no simple way to check for this
kind of patches.

- To do
  - optional logfile instead of requesters
  - decoding of the library's function name via FD files
  - graphical interface using MUI (just kidding :) )
