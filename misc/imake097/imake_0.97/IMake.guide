@node Introduction

    IMake was designed to avoid the shell for programmers who don't
    like languages witch only has commandline compiling and linking,
    including me.

    It is easy to use, and configure, but currently the preferences made
    from inside the program is not saved. So you have to edit its
    @{"tooltypes" link Tooltypes}.

    This version (0.97) is just a beta version for testing and may include
    bugs, as a matter of fact it does include bugs, but not so harmful.
    Look at the @{"bugs" link Bugs} part of this documentation.
    If you have suggestions for the interface or function of the program,
    or maybe some unknown bugs, contact me.

@node Requirements

    Workbench:          2.1
    Extra libraries:    Reqtools.library 38 or greater.

    Reqtools.library by Nico François is freely distributable so it
    is included with IMake.

    IMake has only been tested on Amiga 1200 with Workbench 3.0 so I
    don't know about WB 2.1 compatibility.
    Let me know if it works (or don't work) on your computer-system.

    A programming language is preferred :), preferably a commandline-
    compiler (AMOS wont do). It is optional to link the objectcode
    generated. But more on that in the @{"usage" link Usage} section.
    SAS/C v6.50 works perfectly fine and AmigaE too. A68k assembler
    didn't work so well (but I didn't got it working in shell either).

    Even if you are into big projects you will not notice the difference
    when having IMake running or compiling from the shell, so you don't
    need any more memory than you already have.

@endnode

@node Configuration

    The first thing to do is to edit the tooltypes of IMake. What you
    should know about your compiler is:

1   ·Where is the directory containing the compiler, assembler, linker
    and so on?
    For SAS/C 6.50 it is "sc:c" for example. If you are working
    with AmigaE it should be "AmigaE:bin". This is configured in the
    tooltype WORKDIR. Read part 6 for more information on WORKDIR=.

2   ·What is the name of your compiler?
    For example "sc" with SAS/C, and "ec" with AmigaE.
    Tooltype: COMPILER=

3   ·The path to the editor you want to use.
    Tooltype: EDITOR=

4   ·Options for the compiler.
    If you have SAS/C 6.50 maybe you would like "link" here and the compiler
    will link your project automatically with no need to specify DOLINK.
    It is dependent of your compiler so look in your compiler-documentation.
    Tooltype: OPTIONS=

5   ·If you want another program to take care of linking, the tooltype
    DOLINK should be given  and the name of the linker after LINKER=.
    Options can also be given to the linker with LINKOPTS=.

6   ·If your compiler needs some assigns, you could put them in a script-
    file and save it as "s:imake.start" and activate the STARTSCRIPT
    tooltype. The script-file will then be executed when you start IMake.
    Note! If your compiler needs paths, ex. a command like 'path sc:c add',
    you cannot put them in the imake.start file as IMake is a workbench-
    program and doesn't care about this command.
    Instead you should write this path in the tooltype WORKDIR= as specified
    before.

    That's all you need to know about configuring for programming. The other
    tooltypes are described on the page @{"tooltypes" link Tooltypes}.


        Configuring when the program is started

    You could configure some things when the program is started.
    On some of the gadgets you press the right Amiga key when you click them
    and a requester pops up. Then, type in a new value an press 'OK' or
    'Cancel'.
    These are the values you can change:

    ·A new editor.
    ·A new compiler and compiler options. If the tooltype DOLINK is active
     a new linker and linker options could be specified too.
    ·A new default path for the file-requester.
    ·A new command for the user-gadget.
    For information on the gadgets see @{"Usage" link Usage}.

@node Usage

    To use IMake is simple, as long as you have @{"configured" link Configuration} correct.

    First when IMake is started you should choose a project.
    Click the small gadget marked with nothing and a file-requester pops up.
    Choose an existing project (sourcecode) or write a new name. You may
    also use the appwindow function and drag an icon onto IMakes window.

    Now press the edit gadget if you need to edit the sourcecode, or the
    compile gadget if you want to compile it.
    An output window is opened (dependant on what you have written in the
    OUTPUT= tooltype) and you will hopefully get some information of the
    compilation progress.

    If the compilation was successful, you could try to run your newly
    created program. Just click the Run gadget.
    Note! you must use a name with a dot (.) and then an extension for
    the sourcecode or else the run function is not going to work.

    The button marked 'Save prefs' (or 'Spara inställningar' in Swedish)
    is not working currently, so don't care if nothing happens when you
    click it.

    The gadget in the left downer corner is a user configurable-gadget.
    It can be used to execute a CLI-command from IMake.
    The default action is 'newshell' but it can be changed by configuring
    the tooltype UGADCOMMAND or by pressing the left Amiga-button when
    the gadget is clicked. See the @{"configuration" link Configuration} section for more info
    on that.

    That's it. It is so easy. So get started with the programming NOW!

@node Tooltypes

The IMake Tooltypes

    EDITOR=     The path to the editor you want to use.
    COMPILER=   The compiler-command to execute when you want to
                compile your project.
    OPTIONS=    Options to use with compiler.
    DOLINK      If you want IMake to start a separate linker-program
                after compiling, you should make this one active.
    LINKER=     The linker-program to use (only used if DOLINK is
                active).
    LINKOPTS=   Options for the linker, only used if DOLINK is active.
    WORKDIR=    The directory where to look for compiler and stuff.

    All of those were described closer in @{" Configuration " link Configuration}


    OUTPUT=     Where you want the output from compiler to end up.
                A con: window would be the best choice, but you could
                specify a file-name here, or maybe NIL: if you don't
                want any output (could be a little bit confusing).
    PATH=       The directory where the file-requester shall look first.
    PATTERN=    The pattern in file-requester.
    WINLEFT=    Where the program window should be placed from the left
                edge of the screen.
    WINTOP=     Same, but from the top of screen.
    UGADNAME=   The label to place on the user-configurable gadget in
                the downer left corner of IMakes window.
    UGADCOMMAND= A CLI-command which should be executed each time the
                user-gadget is pressed.
    STARTSCRIPT If you want IMake to look for the 's:imake.start' script
                and execute it on start-up.

@node Bugs

    There are not many known bugs in this version as it has been carefully
    tested, but one of them is the memory-loss of exactly 56 bytes when
    IMake has run.
    Does anyone know what that depends on?

    I cannot get IMake to access the paths made by the CLI-command path.
    Because some compilers need that kind of paths, I have included the
    tooltype WORKDIR= as a temporarily substitute, but if a compiler needs
    more than one path, it doesn't work so well.
    I know that a Workbench-program doesn't work the same way as those
    started from shell and wont get the paths made from shell.
    If someone knows if I could use these paths from a Workbench-program,
    PLEASE!!! contact the @{"Author" link Author}

    This is my first beta release of IMake. It is distributed as a test
    version for YOU to use and test out, then send me suggestions for
    the GUI (which I have worked very hard with), the functions or
    things I have forgotten. Bugs are always welcome too. :-)
    If you have made a localization file for a different language, you
    will also gain grateful thoughts from me.
    AND!!!, you will get the first finished version of IMake (when it is
    ready) without any other sacrifices than a disk (maybe with something
    on it), some money for the postage and your address.
    IMake is not shareware, you'll have to pay because I must send letters
    and that costs money. But soon I'll obtain an i-net address where you
    can reach me (for free).
    If you use internet, include your address and I might contact you that
    way in the future.

    Disclaimer:
    Although IMake has been tested carefully, I cannot take any responsibility
    if your system may be damaged by a crash of IMake.
    I.E. You use this program on your own risk.

    Thanx to:
    Nico François for making the excellent reqtools.library, used by IMake
    for requesters, and for making a lot of other useful programs.
    Rafael D'Halleweyn for Catedit which was used to make the Swedish
    catalog-file.
    Everyone that finds this program useful (and everyone else who uses the
    best computer (Amiga in case you didn't know)).
