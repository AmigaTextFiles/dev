                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                     v1.05
                                     ~~~~~
                                 
               developed and coded by C.Raufuﬂ in September 1991
                               using SAS/C 5.10a

                          THIS PROGRAM IS FREEWARE !!!

  With the help of this program you are able to create a information file for
    your programs and sourcecodes. This file will be saved separately with a
             ".rh" ending and can be displayed with REVisionHEADer.

   REVisionHEADer will open a window in Kick/WB 2.0 design. There are several
    gadgets and a menustrip so it should be self explaining. Here is a short
                        introduction to REVisionHEADer:
          
--- the menu    --- :   - About        ... well, that should be clear
                        - Load         ... load a .rh-file
                        - Save         ... save a .rh-file
                        - Iconify      ... iconify REVisionHEADer
                                           (wake up by RMB on active window)
                        - Quit         ... exit REVisionHEADer
                                           (with requester)

--- the gadgets --- :   - Closegadget  ... exit REVisionHEADer
                                           (with requester)
                        - About        ... look above
                        - Load         ... look above
                        - Save         ... look above
                        - Quit         ... look above              
                        - StringGads   ... ready for entering text
                        
  These are, so far, all the functions available with REVisionHEADer v1.05. I
     will try to include several new gadgets/menupoints/functions in future
              versions. Watch out for v2.00; for now that's all...

    See ya' in 1991,
