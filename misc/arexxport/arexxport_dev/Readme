The email address is only available until the end of June 1996, after
which I graduate and will getting a new internet connection. When I
do I'll repost this archive with a new email address in it.
(Prob. September/October 1996).

Okay, on with the show.

At the moment there is only glue code for the freeware version of
dice. But you can use the .fd file to generate the glue code for any
other compiler you want. If you do please sent me a copy of the glue
code. (or details of how to create it, if it uses available tools)
and I'll include it a later release.

Also there are no translations, so if you do one please let me have a
copy to include. Cheers.

Localisations works when locale.library 38+ is available, but the
arexxport library will function without it.
There is a single arexx function 'LocalErrorText' this is a localised 
version of the rexx internal function 'ErrorText'. To use this the 
arexxport.libary must be addlib(). See demo/ArexxTest for an example.
NB the offset for the the addlib() command is -108 not -30.
 
The demo.c shows how to program the library. It's all straight
forward - I think - email me with your problems.
