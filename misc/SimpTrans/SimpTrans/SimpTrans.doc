mode        - a mode of translation
input.ct    - a .ct file generated from a .cd file using CatComp
output.ct   - the resulting .ct file of your choice
phrasebook  - phrasebook file to be optimized


                           Installation
                           ============

   Place uk2gr.phrasebook in LOCALE:
   Place SimpTrans in C:
   Place SimpTrans.doc in HELP:English/ or HELP:


                         Quick Instructions
                         ==================

   Take a look at the uk2gr.phrasebook.

   Create a phrasebook for a language pair in that style.  String  to
   be translated in one row, preceded by ; and a space and translated
   string in the next row. Save it as LOCALE:LangA2LangB.phrasebook

   When you look  at  a  CatComp-generated  .ct  file  to  translate,
   instead  of  adding  the  strings in the .ct file, add then to the
   .phrasebook together with the original strings.

   Now save the phrasebook, optimize it with the  command  "SimpTrans
   LangA2LangB"  and finally translate the .ct file with "SimpTrans
   LangA2LangB original.ct translated.ct".


                              In Detail
                              =========

Translation Modes
-----------------

   First you need to specify a mode of translation. If you use a mode
   called   my_mode   then   SimpTrans   looks   for  a  file  called
   Locale:my_mode.phrasebook in which a list of standard  translation
   strings  maybe  found.  The SimpTrans archives contains an example
   phrasebook    for    translation    from    english    to    greek
   (uk2gr.phrasebook).


The input file
--------------

   The input file should be a file created  from  a  .cd  file  using
   CatComp.  This is because CatComp includes the original strings as
   commented lines in the .ct file.


Adding to the phrasebook
------------------------

   Translations are performed using  simple  linear  search,  so  the
   first words or phrases in the phrasebook take precedence.

   (Use the optimize mode to avoid problems with phrasebooks)

   For example if you have the phrase  "Open  Window"  translated  as
   "Make New Window" at the top of your phrasebook and later you have
   "Open" translated as "Yank" and "Window"  as  "opening"  then  the
   phrase  "Open  Window" in the .ct file will be translated as "Make
   New Window". If however the full phrase translation  occurs  later
   in  the  phrasebook, the sting "Open Window" will be translated to
   "Yank opening" instead. (Play  around  with  some  .ct  files  and
   phrasebooks and see what happens..) ..

   The good thing is that most  programs  share  a  lot  of  strings.
   Translations  for these strings should be placed at the top of the
   phrasebook so that  they  are  all  translated  in  the  same  way
   exactly.  Perhaps  there  could  be  a  standard  for  this  -I am
   personally frustrated by the various ways in which  authors  chose
   to translate uk text to greek..


Future
------

   -  Automatic  creation  of  phrasebooks  from   already-translated
   catalog files.

   -  AI Translation engine. Well.. just a thought.

   -  GUI.
