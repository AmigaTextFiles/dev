<h1> temgen - universal code generator </h1>
<b><samp>Temgen</samp></b> is an universal code generator based on its own
template language. It can be used for generating any texts, such as
program source in any language, HTML documents, or even
texts in natural languages.
Possible applications are similar to preprocessors (such as M4)
and to PHP-like tools.    
<p>
The inspiration was mainly Clarion template language with
beautiful "embed/emit" commands. This feature actually mimics
human activity during code writing: author (programmer
- alive code generator) never writes text linearly,
he rather moves over files inserting pieces of code here and there.
<p>
This is illustrated in following example, showing what 
one does when adding new command line option to an application:
<ol>
<li> Define global variable
<li> Add switch branch
<li> Add description in help text
</ol>
<p>
Using the template showed below, one can do all the things
with one function call.
<p>
<table border=1 bgcolor="#ffe0c0" width="98%"><tr><th colspan=2 align='left'> 
Adding option 
</th></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
  @function  opt( type, var, letter, help )
  @emit  "variables"
    $type  $var;
  @emit  "switch"
    case $letter:
  @if  ( $type == "int" )
         $var = atoi(argv[ i ]);
  @else
         $var = argv[ i ];
  @endif  
         break;
  @emit "help"
         "$help"
  @endfunction
</pre></td><td><pre>
 
1. Define global     
   variable 
2. Add branch          
   in switch command  
 
   ... depending on     
       type of the variable
 
  
   
  
3. Add description
   in help text     
</pre></tr></table><p>
Lines starting with <b><samp>@</samp></b> control generation flow.    
Other lines include templates of generated strings.    
<p>
Template code is clean and easy to read.
The <b><samp>@embed</samp></b>/<b><samp>@emit</samp></b> pair is simpler in use 
then <b><samp>divert</samp></b>/<b><samp>undivert</samp></b> known from M4.
<p>
The syntax of the template language follows well known languages
(C and PHP). Unlike  PHP, <b><samp>Temgen</samp></b> is universal generator.
There are no assumptions about generated text. The "escaping" 
is also simpler, based on two kind of template lines: control lines
and data lines. Such a code is easy to read and understand.
<p> 
It is not a preprocessor, it is rather language interpreter.
It has compound data structures (records, hash tables)
and classic function call and definition mechanisms.

with source code included.
The author will be pleased with all suggestions and 
even with critique (if polite ;)
