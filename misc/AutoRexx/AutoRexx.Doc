                            AutoRexx Version 1.0
          Copyright (c) 1992 Mark Cassidy, Wize Productions Denmark
                        Release date: 19 October 1992
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: What is this then?
A: An ARexx server, designed to provide the fastest possible access to your
   autodocs.

Q: Ahh, this means that I don't have to wait for ages (actually seconds)
   whenever I browse through a threat of functions?
A: Correct!  Eventhough AutoRexx will only save you a few seconds on each
   access to the autodocs database, it WILL seem like a significant gain.

Q: So how do I use it?
A: That is entirely up to you.  As mentioned, AutoRexx is an ARexx server,
   meaning that it is host for a few useful commands, how you use them is
   up to you.  In this package, I've included the Rexx script I use myself
   in CygnusEd, and this will probably be more than enough for most people.

Q: CygnusEd?  Is AutoRexx only for use with that?
A: No!  However, AutoRexx DOES supply some functions which will only be
   usable with CygnusEd.  These functions, however, are mainly for fast
   interaction from YOUR place in CED till the docfile appears.

Q: Appears?  You mean loaded into the editor (CygnusEd in this case)?
A: Correct!

Q: Why not use AmigaGuide or HyperText?
A: Because I find it more convenient to have the docfile IN the editor,
   editable.  This provides the opportunity of cutting and pasting.  Another
   advantage is, that you can have BOTH the docfile AND your source(s) in
   the editor at the same time.   Secondly, I find that CED is more
   easy to handle efficiently than ie AmigaGuide.

Q: I see.  Do I need to install it in any way in CygnusEd?
A: Yes!  You install it as a Dos/Rexx command (Menu: "Special" Item: "Dos/ARexx
   interface" Sub: "Install Dos/ARexx command") on the function key of your
   choice.

Q: OK, that sounds easy.  I should just install it as "AutoRexx" then?
A: Oops no!  Sorry!   You need to install the script on the function-key.  This
   means something like "AutoRexx.CED" should be installed in CygnusEd, NOT
   the AutoRexx executable itself.

Q: What about the executable then?
A: Well, that is the actual server.  You can launch it from your User-Startup
   file.

Q: User-Startup?  What is that?
A: The standard startup-file for WB2.x.

Q: But I run WB1.3...
A: I'm sorry.  AutoRexx will only run on KickStart versions of V37 or higher.

[...1 week later...]

Q: OK, now I've bought the upgrade kit, it's GREAT!!!
A: Correct! :-)
   Well, as I was saying...  Place a line in your user-startup doing something
   to the effect of: "Run >NIL: <NIL: AutoRexx AutoDocs:ADocs.REFS"

Q: ADocs.REFS?  What is that?
A: An ASCII index-file of all your autodocs files.

Q: An INDEX file??  Why use AutoRexx if I already have an index file?
A: Because AutoRexx will cache this file in internal binary form, providing
   you with fast access (as already mentioned).

Q: OK.  How do I make this index file then?
A: By using the supplied AutoRefs utility.   And don't forget to thank Matt
   Dillon for this utility, he's the one who wrote it.

Q: Matt Dillon, isn't he the one...
A: Yes!

Q: OK, I'll remember that.
A: Thanx.

Q: Well, I guess this rounds it all up then?
A: I should think so.  There's not much to it really.  The supplied script will
   run nicely in CygnusEd.  If you need a script for another editor, it should
   be fairly easy to write.  Just remember a VERY important thing..

Q: What is that then?
A: Send me a copy for inclusion in further AutoRexx distributions :-)

Q: <*GRIN*>  Sounds reasonable, considering that AutoRexx is completely for
   free.
A: That's what I hoped you would say :-)

Q: Well OK, I think I'll install it then.  Thanks again!
A: You're welcome!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're lucky, AutoRexx will work as described in this documentation.  If
not, bad luck, good you didn't waste any money.

I have tested AutoRexx on my own system, and a few people have tested this
programs on their own setup.  I know that AutoRexx works on these systems,
but do NOT under ANY circumstances guarantee that AutoRexx will work for you.

Should you have any problems with AutoRexx, I will most likely try to fix the
problem.  If not, bad luck again.

Flames to never-never land, criticism welcome.


All this said...  AutoRexx will most likely work on any setup, as the program
itself is quite simple.


Mark Cassidy holds ALL rights to this program at ALL times.  Under NO
circumstances must this program be distributed for a fee in ANY product,
commercial or non-commercial.  Resonable charges for P&P will be accepted
up to the equivalent of 5US$ (7DEM, 25DKK).

This rule does NOT apply to "Det Ny COMputer", whom I hereby DENY ANY rights
to USE or DISTRIBUTE this program in ANY form at ANY price.

                       AutoRexx Technical Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

1> AutoRexx REFS/M,P=PORTNAME/K

REFS is the name(s) of all the AutoRefs generated index files
PORTNAME is the portname AutoRexx should be using.  The default for the latter
is AUTOREXX, and further invocations will be "AUTOREXX.1" etc.


Usage:

1> AutoRefs REFSFILE/A DOCFILE/A/M

* NOTE that the actual syntax does not appear this way in the actual program,
I've just 'redone' it to comform to WB2.x standards for command-templates.

Common usage will be something like "AutoRefs AutoDocs:ADOC.REFS #?/#?.Doc"

Note:  I sincerely do not hope I'm breaking any copyright rules by including
Matt Dillon's program in this archive.  Proper credit and thanks for this
program goes to Matt Dillon.

AutoRexx/AUR_AUTOGET                                  AutoRexx/AUR_AUTOGET

	NAME
		AUR_AUTOGET -- Get a function from the autodocs

	SYNOPSIS
		AUR_AUTOGET Function/A FileName/A

	FUNCTION
		AUR_AUTOGET will parse the internal function index and extract
		the function from the autodocs file.  The result is written
		to FileName/A.

	INPUTS
		Function/A	- Name of the function to extract
		FileName/A	- Name of the filename to write the result to

	RESULTS
		rc will be ~0 if the function was not available in the
		autodocs.

	BUGS
		None

	SEE ALSO
		AutoRexx/AUR_GETCEDWORD, AutoRexx/AUR_FILETOCED


AutoRexx/AUR_ADDREFS                                  AutoRexx/AUR_ADDREFS

	NAME
		AUR_ADDREFS --	Add a new REFS file to the internal
				function table.

	SYNOPSIS
		AUR_ADDREFS Refs/A/M

	FUNCTION
		AUR_ADDREFS will load the specified REFS file(s) and ADD them
		to it's internal list of functions.  This command is rather
		CPU intensive and therefore time-consuming.

	INPUTS
		Refs/A/M	- Name of the REFS file(s) to add.

	RESULTS
		None

	BUGS
		AUR_ADDREFS will NOT check for any duplicate function entries,
		meaning that only first occurence of any function will ever
		be noticed by AutoRexx, but several copies may be lying
		around in the function table.
		This is not a real problem though, unless you mess too much
		around with the REFS files.

AutoRexx/AUR_FILETOCED                                AutoRexx/AUR_FILETOCED

	NAME
		AUR_FILETOCED	- Bring a file into CED

	SYNOPSIS
		AUR_FILETOCED FileName/A

	FUNCTION
		AUR_FILETOCED will load the FileName/A file into CED, taking
		notice to the previous autodocs file loaded by this command.
		In English: If you have previously loaded an autodocs file
		with this command, and the file is STILL in CED (quite often),
		AUR_FILETOCED will load the NEW autodocs file at the same
		'place' this previous file is loaded.

	INPUTS
		FileName/A	- Filename to load into CED

	RESULTS
		rc will be ~0 if CED's Rexx-port cannot be located.

	BUGS
		None

	SEE ALSO
		AutoRexx/AUR_GETCEDWORD, AutoRexx/AUR_AUTOGET


AutoRexx/AUR_GETCEDWORD                               AutoRexx/AUR_GETCEDWORD

	NAME
		AUR_GETCEDWORD -- Get active word in CED

	SYNOPSIS
		AUR_GETCEDWORD

	FUNCTION
		AUR_GETCEDWORD will get the 'active' word in CED, meaning the
		word on which the cursor is currently placed (or the word to
		the immediate left).  AUR_GETCEDWORD is 'smart' enough to know
		about '(' chars and the likes.

	INPUTS
		None

	RESULTS
		The word under the cursor (if any)

	BUGS
		None

	SEE ALSO
		AutoRexx/AUR_AUTOGET, AutoRexx/AUR_FILETOCED


AutoRexx/AUR_NEWREFS                                  AutoRexx/AUR_NEWREFS

	NAME
		AUR_NEWREFS - Initialize a new REFS function table

	SYNOPSIS
		AUR_NEWREFS REFS/A

	FUNCTION
		AUR_NEWREFS will remove all internal function tables and
		reload your new REFS file(s).  Due to the nature of the
		internal tables, this function is very CPU intensitive,
		and VERY slow in execution.

	INPUTS
		REFS/A		- Filename(s) of the new REFS file(s)

	RESULTS
		None

	BUGS
		If you need to remove ALL internal tables without reloading
		any new ones, you need to specify a 'dummy' file for
		AUR_NEWREFS.

		AutoRexx/AUR_ADDREFS


AutoRexx/AUR_QUIT                                     AutoRexx/AUR_QUIT

	NAME
		AUR_QUIT -- Quits AutoRexx

	SYNOPSYS
		AUR_QUIT

	FUNCTION
