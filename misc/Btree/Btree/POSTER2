# This is a shell archive, meaning:
# 1. Remove everything above the #! /bin/sh line.
# 2. Save the resulting text in a file.
# 3. Execute the file with /bin/sh (not csh) to create:
#
#	btree.c		- the main B-tree code, organised as a set of
#			  procedures returning error/ success codes
#	btree.h		- error codes for btree.c
#	btree.fe.c	- the B-tree "front-end" system 
#	btree.fe.h	- the real code of the front-end system
#	btree.test.c	- the B-tree test system 
#	btree.test.h	- various constants used by the tests
#	btree.prt.h	- routines used for printing out B-trees
#			  used by both the front-end and the tests
#	btree.fe.M	- makefile for constructing the btree front-end
#	btree.test.M	- makefile for constructing the btree test
#
# 4. Upon completion, execute
#	(i)	'make -f btree.fe.M' to build the front-end system
#		(executable 'btree.fe').
#	(ii)	'make -f btree.test.M' to build the test system
#		(executable 'btree.test').
