There are still some latent bugs in this code.  For example, the test
program, btree.test, will run for a while then crash the machine.
However, since this looks to be very useful with a little more work, 
and is the first PD set of btree routines I have come across, I have
decided to include them on this disk.

Note the the current available release of the Manx C compiler does not
allow passing of structures as function arguments, hence will not
compile this code.  My understanding is that this is due to be fixed
in the next release.
