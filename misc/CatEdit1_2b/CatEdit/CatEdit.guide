  NOTE: Due to the changing behaviors of  AmigaGuide, Workbench 3.0 -and
        lower-  users  will  find  the guide a little odd: they will see
        several double backslashes ('\\') where there should only be one
        ('\').
  NOTE2: Due to the  changing behaviors of AmigaGuide  the previous NOTE
         should  have  looked  ridiculous  to Workbench 3.1 -and higher-
         users, but the rest of the guide will be ok.

  @{b}@{u}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}

  One  of the major updates of Workbench 2.1 was it's ability to run the
  Workbench  or  any  other  program  (that  is @{"localized" link localized}) in different
  languages. This way, even if a program isn't translated in your native
  language, there is always a language that you understand.

  Now  there  is  CatEdit,  a  program  that  allows  you  to  translate
  @{"localized" link localized} programs in any language that the Amiga supports. Currently
  the Amiga supports 9 languages:
          -Dansk
          -Deutsch
          -Español
          -Français
          -Italiano
          -Nederlands
          -Norsk
          -Português
          -Svenska
  [Other  languages  are  also possible but you'll have to make your own
  '.language' file.]

  With  CatEdit  it  is  also  possible  to remove those little (or big)
  errors  in  the  translation  of  a program or translate @{"strings" link string} into
  other strings that you prefer. You can even change Workbench strings.

  Unlike  the  Commodore  CatComp  program,  you don't need the original
  @{"catalog  description" link cd}  to  translate  a  @{"catalog" link catalog}, all  you  need is a
  catalog  (it  doesn't  matter  which  language,  as  long  as you  can
  understand it). But CatEdit can also read catalog descriptions, it can
  even write catalog descriptions.

  The CatEdit archive now contains extra catalog descriptions:
   -The `workbench.cd' description only contains the shortcut keys for
    the Workbench menus. You can use this to change or add keys to the
    menu   (as   an  example  you  could  add  the  'F'  key  for  the
    'Icons/Format  Disk...'  menu-item). To change the keys you should
    first   change  `workbench.cd'  (use  a  text-editor  to  see  the
    descriptions),  then  you  should read this description and @{"Merge" link merge}
    with  original `workbench.catalog' (replace the original strings).
    You   can   then  save  this  catalog  to  your  `LOCALE:Catalogs'
    directory.
   -The  `monitors.cd'  description contains the names for all the 3.0
    ScreenModes.  It also contains names for ScreenModes that normally
    don't   have   a  name.  [When  you  use  a  text-editor  to  edit
    `monitors.cd'  you'll see that the string-id's are the same as the
    decimal ScreenMode-id's.]

  CatEdit   requires   Workbench   2.1  or  higher  (locale.library  and

  @{b}@{u}Starting CatEdit@{ub}@{uu}

  CatEdit can be started from the Shell or the Workbench.


  To  start CatEdit from the Workbench you have to double-click its icon
  (the  worldmap).  Via  Tool  Types (use the 'Information...' menu item
  from the 'Icons' menu of the Workbench) you can set four arguments:

    CATALOG      - filename of @{"catalog" link catalog} to be loaded;
    DESCRIPTION  - filename  of the  @{"catalog  description" link cd} (.cd) to be
                   loaded;
    TRANSLATION  - filename  of the  @{"catalog  translation" link ct} (.ct) to be
                   loaded   (works  only  if  a  description  is  also
                   loaded, otherwise it is ignored);
    PUBSCREEN    - name   of  the  public  screen  to  open  on  (case
                   sensitive).


  You  can  also  start  CatEdit from the Workbench with a Project icon.
  When you set the Default Tool (use the 'Information...' menu item from
  the  'Icons'  menu  of  the Workbench) of the icon to CatEdit, CatEdit
  will also be started.


  To start CatEdit from the Shell you have to enter 'CatEdit' in a Shell
  window. The template is:

   CatEdit CATALOG/K,CD=DESCRIPTION/K,CT=TRANSLATION/K,PS=PUBLICSCREEN/K

  The  arguments have -of course- the same meaning as the tooltypes with
  the same name.

  The  CatEdit  catalogs  should  be  placed in the 'CatEdit/<language>'
  subdirectory  of  the  directory  where  CatEdit  resides in or in the
  'LOCALE:Catalogs/<language>' directory.

  @{b}New@{ub}

  Removes the current @{"catalog" link catalog} from memory.

  If  the  loaded catalog has been changed you will be asked if you want
  to save that catalog before removing it from memory.
@endnode

@node open "CatEdit Menus: Project/Open..."
@prev new
@next merge
@toc menus

  @{b}Open...@{ub}

  Read a @{"catalog" link catalog} from disk into memory.

  The  filerequester  will open in the 'LOCALE:Catalogs' directory if no
  catalog was specified as a shell argument or Workbench tooltype.

  CatEdit  can  also  read catalogs that contain  no language or version
  information. Version and revision will then be initialized to 1.1.

  If the loaded  catalog has been changed you will be  asked if you want
  to save that catalog before opening another one.
@endnode

@node merge "CatEdit Menus: Projects/Merge..."
@prev open
@next save
@toc menus

  @{b}Merge...@{ub}

  Merge @{"catalog" link catalog} from disk with catalog in memory.

  This is  very handy  if a  catalog doesn't contain  a certain @{"string" link string}:
  you  first  open  the catalog you want to translate, you then merge a
  catalog  in  another  language, but  for the  same program, that does
  contain the string.

  Before  merging begins you will  be asked if you want strings that are
  in  both  catalogs  to  replace  the  original,  the  new,  both or no
  string(s).

  If the loaded catalog  and the catalog  to merge  with don't  have the
  same name or  if the versions aren't  the same CatEdit  will display a
  requester  saying  that the  catalogs or not compatible, you can  then
  choose to ignore the warning or cancel the merging.
@endnode

@node save "CatEdit Menus: Projects/Save"
@prev merge
@next saveas
@toc menus

  @{b}Save@{ub}

  Write a @{"catalog" link catalog} to disk.

  Before  the catalog is saved the revision and the date of  the catalog
  are updated.

  If  the catalog is still in memory because a program  was using it and
  if  you  are using locale.library version 38 or 40 (Workbench 2.1, 3.0
  and  3.1),  CatEdit  will  try  to  flush the catalog from  memory. If
  CatEdit  doesn't flush  the catalog  then programs  using that catalog
  will  still  be  using  the  old  @{"strings" link string},  because they are still in
  memory.
  For the flush to succeed no other  program may be using the catalog at
  the time that the catalog is saved.

  Technical  note:  the  catalog  is  flushed  by  trying  to  flush the
  locale.library from memory, but since it can't flush (CatEdit is still
  using  it) it will only remove all the catalogs from memory. Since I'm
  not   sure  if  this  will  also  work  with  newer  versions  of  the
  locale.library the flush will only happen with locale.library versions
  38 and 40.

  @{b}Save As...@{ub}

  Save a @{"catalog" link catalog} with a different name or in a different drawer.

  A filerequester will appear  where you can enter the new  name/drawer.
  If  the  catalog  already  exists  you  will  be asked if  you want to
  overwrite  that catalog  (overwriting that catalog  will mean that you
  loose all the translations in that catalog, be careful).

  The rest of the 'Save As...' process is the same as @{"Save" link save}.
@endnode

@node info "CatEdit Menus: Projects/Info..."
@prev saveas
@next about
@toc menus

  @{b}Info...@{ub}

  Gives  information  about  currently  loaded  @{"catalog" link catalog}:  name  of  the
  catalog,  version  and revision, date, language of the catalog, number
  of @{"strings" link string} in the catalog and 'more'.

  'More' is the text that is placed after the date in the version string
  of the catalog, this can for example contain the name of the author of
  the catalog (i.e. by Rafael D'Halleweyn);
@endnode

  about the translation of CatEdit.
@endnode

@node quit "CatEdit Menus: Projects/Quit"
@prev about
@next pasteoriginal
@toc menus

  @{b}Quit@{ub}

  Quit CatEdit.

  Note  that  the default  Quit shortcut (i.e. 'Q') is not usable when a
  @{"catalog" link catalog}  is  loaded,  because the @{"string gadget" link stringgadget} is always active and
  <RightAmiga><Q> means undo to a string gadget.

  If  the  loaded catalog has been changed you are asked  if you want to
  save the catalog before quitting.
@endnode

@node pasteoriginal "CatEdit Menus: Edit/Paste Original"
@prev quit
@next changelanguage
@toc menus

  @{b}Paste Original@{ub}

  Replace the translated @{"string" link string} with the original string.

  While working with a @{"catalog" link catalog} CatEdit always keeps two representations
  of a string in memory: the original  string (as it was loaded) and the
  new (i.e. translated) string.
@endnode

@node changelanguage "CatEdit Menus: Edit/Change Language..."

@next find
@toc menus

  @{b}Change Language...@{ub}

  Change the language of a @{"catalog" link catalog}.

  A  requester will be displayed where you can replace the language with
  the new language.

  If  the  language is changed, the path of the file requester will also
  be  changed,  for example if you change from 'english' to 'nederlands'
  and  the  path was 'LOCALE:Catalogs/english/Sys' then the path will be

  @{b}Read Catalog Description...@{ub}

  Read a @{"catalog description" link cd} into memory.

  If  there  is  already a @{"catalog" link catalog} loaded the  catalogs will be merged,
  the  catalog description  will overwrite the original  @{"string" link string} and the
  string name.

  If there is no catalog loaded, the  catalog description will fill both
  both  the  original and the new string, the  string names will also be
  read.

  While  reading  the  catalog  description, the validity  of the string
  names  will be checked and the string  length will be compared against
  the  minimum  and  maximum  string  length  described  in  the catalog
  description.  If  something  is  wrong  a  requester will be displayed

  read a @{"catalog description" link cd}.

  When  a  certain  string  name  can  not  be found a requester will be
  displayed, you can then choose to ignore that @{"string" link string} or stop reading.

  While  reading  the  catalog translation,  the validity of  the string
  names  will be checked and the  string length will be compared against

  @{b}Write Catalog Description...@{ub}

  Write a @{"catalog description" link cd} to disk.

  To be  able  to  write a catalog description, CatEdit  has to know the
  names  of the @{"strings" link string},  if CatEdit doesn't know the names a requester
  will  appear  asking  you if you want CatEdit to generate these names.
  These  names  will  probably  differ  from  the  names in the original
  catalog description that was used to generate the @{"catalog" link catalog}.

  If  the  file  you  selected  already  exists, a requester will appear

@node snoop "CatEdit Menus: Extras/Snoop Catalog..."

@toc menus

  @{b}Snoop Catalog...@{ub}

  Normally, every @{"localized" link localized} program has a builtin language. You can use
  this  menu  item  to  try  to  snoop  these  builtin @{"strings" link string} from the
  program.

  While  CatEdit is in snoop-mode a requerster will appear that contains
  the current status, the name and language of the catalog being snooped
  and the number of strings snooped.

  Whenever  a  program  tries to open a @{"catalog" link catalog}, CatEdit will catch this
  attempt  and  ask  you if you want to snoop this catalog. When CatEdit
  already  has  a  catalog  in  memory,  CatEdit  will only try to snoop
  catalogs with the same name.

  When  CatEdit  is  busy  snooping  strings,  the status will change to
  `snooping  strings'  and  CatEdit  can't be stopped from snooping (the
  `Stop' gadget is ghosted).

  When  all  programs  that  CatEdit  is  snooping  from have closed the
  catalog  the  status  will change back to `waiting for a catalog to be
  opened' and you can stop snooping.

  CatEdit  snoops  the  strings  from  programs  by changing some of the
  Amiga's internals.  When you stop CatEdit from snooping,  CatEdit will
  try  to  restore  this,  but  if  another program has changed the same
  internals, CatEdit won't be able to restore them. In this case CatEdit
  won't  be  able to stop snooping, and you should try to quit the other
  program  before  attempting  to stop snooping again. This might happen
  when you use two CatEdits to snoop and you stop them in reverse order.
@endnode


@node replacereq "CatEdit Requesters: Replace-requester"
@prev replacereq
@next replacereq

  @{b}Replace-requester@{ub}

  The  replace-requester  is  the  place  where  all  find  and  replace
  operations start: here you can select what you want to find, with what
  you  want  it  to  replace (if the replace mode is enabled) and how to
  find.

  There  are  three  scan  switches: 'Ignore case', 'Ignore accents' and
  'Search   backwards'.   The   'Ignore   case'   switch   activates   a
  case-insensitive scan through the catalog. The 'Ignore accents' switch
  activates  an  accent-insensitive scan, this can be very handy because
  not  every derivative of the same word will have the same accents. The
  'Search backwards' switch activates a backwards scan, the strings will
  be  scanned  from  left to right, but the catalog will be scanned from
  the  current  string  to the first string (instead of the last string,
  when the switch is not activated).

  The  'Replace  mode' switch toggles the replace mode, so even when you
  opened the requester with @{"Find..." link find} you can still use it to replace.

  After the scan is started it will stop at the first occurence starting
  from  the  current cursor position. The cursor will then be positioned
  at the start of that occurence.

  When in 'Replace mode' a text will appear in the screentitle:

                   Replace? (Y)es/(N)o/(G)lobal/(A)bort

  Pressing  'y' will replace the current occurence and scan to the next.
  When  you  press 'n' CatEdit will scan to the next occurence. Pressing
  'g'  initiates  the 'global-replace-mode': all occurences are replaced
  without  very  questions.  And  if  you  press 'a' the replace will be
  aborted.

  Note  that  while  this  question  is in the screentitle you can still
  scroll  the  @{"string listview" link stringlistview} and the @{"show listview" link showlistview} or even cycle the
  @{"show cyclegadget" link showcycle}.

  @{b}String listview@{ub}

  The  string  listview  is  a  list  of  all the @{"strings" link string} that are in a
  @{"catalog" link catalog}. The new string will always be displayed in that list.

  You can scroll through the list with the scroll bar or the up and down
  arrow-gadgets.  You  can  also  scroll  with  the  cursor  keys on the
  keyboard:  <Up> and <Down> will select the previous resp. next string.
  If  you  press  a  cursor  key together with <Shift> the listview will
  scroll  one  view  at  a  time, together with <Ctrl> the listview will
  scroll  to  the  last  or  the first string. (Scrolling might not work
  optimal under Kickstart 2.04.)

  Whenever you select a string  from the list with the mouse, the string
  will automatically be placed in the @{"string gadget" link stringgadget}.

  When  no  catalog  is  loaded  the  string  listview  will be  ghosted
  (listview doesn't ghost under Kickstart 2.04).

  The  string  gadget always contains the currently selected @{"string" link string} and

  When  you set the @{"show cyclegadget" link showcycle} to original you can always see the
  original  (untranslated)  string.  You can then use <RightAmiga><X> to
  make the string gadget empty, so that you can enter the new string.

  You  can  move  the  cursor  to  the  start  of  the  next  word  with
  <Alt><Right>  ,  <Alt><Left>  will  move  the cursor to the end of the
  previous  word. Together with <Ctrl>, the <Right> and <Left> keys move
  to the next/previous '\\n'.

  When   you   press   return  the  @{"string listview" link stringlistview}  and  possibly  the
  @{"show listview" link showlistview}  will  be updated. If you forget to press return before
  you select a new string your changes will be lost!

  While  entering  a string, CatEdit will  check that you don't enter an
  invalid  hexadecimal number with '\\x'. The screen will flash if you do
  and the key press won't be accepted.

  When you press return the strings  length will be compared against the
  minimum and  maximum string length (CatEdit will only know the minimum
  and    maximum   length   if   you   loaded   the   catalog   from   a
  @{"catalog description" link cd}),  if  the  length  is  to  short  or  to long, a
  requester will warn you about it.

  When you press return the new  and original string will be compared to
  see  if  they  contain the same  @{"% commands" link procentcommand}, if not, a requester will
  warn you.

  When no @{"catalog" link catalog} is loaded the string gadget will be ghosted.

@node showcycle "CatEdit Gadgets: Show cyclegadget"
@toc gadgets

  @{b}Show cyclegadget@{ub}

  With the show cyclegadget you can choose the @{"string" link string} that is displayed
  in  the  @{"show listview" link showlistview}. CatEdit always keeps two representations of a
  string in memory:  the original string  (as it was loaded) and the new
  (i.e. translated) string.

  To  cycle  the  show  cyclegadget  you  can  use the its shortcut: use
  <RightAmiga> plus  the  underlined  character (when using the built-in
  strings, the shortcut is <RightAmiga><S>).

  When no @{"catalog" link catalog} is loaded the show cyclegadget will be ghosted.
@endnode

@node showlistview "CatEdit Gadgets: Show listview"
@toc gadgets
@next showlistview

  @{b}Show listview@{ub}

  The  show listview gives a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) view
  of the  currently selected @{"string" link string}. Newlines, formfeeds, vertical tabs
  and '\\0' force a newline. This is more or less the way that the string
  will look like when used by its program.

  With  the  @{"show  cyclegadget" link showcycle} you  can select  the string to view: the
  original or the new string.

  If  the show listview contains more lines then it can display, you can
  scroll  with  the  scroll bar or the up and down gadgets. You can also
  scroll  the  show  listview with the keyboard: <Alt><Down> scrolls the
  listview  down,  <Alt><Up> scrolls the listview up (keyboard scrolling
  of the show listview doesn't work under Kickstart 2.04).

@node localization "Localizing CatEdit"
@prev gadgets

  @{b}@{u}Localization@{ub}@{uu}

  CatEdit is localized, this means that you can translate CatEdit in any
  language that  the  Amiga  supports.  The built-in CatEdit language is
  english and currently there are eight translations:

    ·Dansk
    ·Deutsch
    ·Español
    ·Français
    ·Italiano
    ·Nederlands
    ·Polski
    ·Svenska

  If you want you can translate CatEdit in your own language. To do that
  you  should  -of  course-  use  CatEdit.  When  you  double-click  the
  'TranslateCatEdit'  icon  the  CatEdit  @{"strings" link string} will automatically be
  loaded, ready to be translated.

  When  translating  CatEdit  make  sure  that every shortcut (menus and
  gadget) is unique.
@endnode


@node translating "CatEdit: Translating a catalog"

  @{b}@{u}Translating a catalog@{ub}@{uu}

  When translating a catalog there are a few rules that you should stick
  to:

    When  you  are  picking  the shortcuts for gadgets and menus, make
    sure  that  they  are unique, don't use the same key twice. A good
    program  will automatically use this new shortcut when the @{"string" link string}
    is changed. Gadget shortcuts are usually preceded by an underscore
    '_'  (e.g.  '_Cancel')  and  menu  shortcuts precede the menu text
    followed  by a nil character (e.g. 'Q\\0Quit'). The standard way to
    indicate  that  you  don't  want  a  shortcut  is  to not place an
    underscore  in  the  gadget  text or place a space ' ' in the menu
    text (e.g. ' \\0Quit').

    Always  make  sure  that  the  original  string and the new string
    contain  the  same  number  and  type of @{"% commands" link procentcommand}. CatEdit will
    automatically checks this.

    Sometimes  the  string  contains  some  sort  of  control sequence
    (hexadecimal  numbers (\\xXX) or escape sequences (starting with \\e
    or \\c)), it's best to leave them unchanged.

    Since  @{"catalogs" link catalog}  don't  contain  information  about  minimum  and
    maximum  width,  you  should  be careful not to use to short or to
    long strings.

    Don't take advantage of catalogs containing the programs copyright
    notice to change the copyright notice.

@node history "CatEdit history"
@next history

  @{b}@{u}History@{ub}@{uu}

  ·release 1.0 [38.890 (17.9.93)]
    -first release.

  ·release 1.1 [38.922 (26.11.93)]
    -Added a plain @{"Save" link save}. Suggested by Roger Andersson.
    -Added new  menu: 'Search/Replace' containing @{"Find..." link find}, @{"Find Next" link findnext}
     @{"Replace..." link replace} and @{"Replace Next" link replacenext}. Suggested by Roger Anndersson.
    -By  accident  I  discovered  that  the generation of string names
     still allows double underscores (this was never meant to happen).
    -The  previous error lead to another error: when reading a catalog
     DESCRIPTION  with invalid string names, you would get a requester
     stating   that  a  name  was  invalid  while  reading  a  catalog
     TRANSLATION. That has been changed to catalog description.
    -While  building  the menus for the CatEdit window, CatEdit made a
     mistake  while  looking  for the command key. Bug report by Claus
     Jacobsen, thanks Claus.
    -When  you  pressed shift down the listview would first select the
     highest  visible  item  and after that it would scroll ok. Fixed.
     Reported by Roger Andersson.
    -When  you  cancelled Merge,  with the  Merge-mode requester,  the 
     CatEdit window was no longer accessible. Fixed.
    -The shortcuts for the  gadgets may now be accented (shortcuts for
     ReqTools shouldn't be accented).
    -When you changed  the language of a  catalog that  didn't contain
     language information the save path would be wrong, fixed.
    -Guide now looks better under Workbench 3.1 (and worse under older
     versions): the missing backslashes are now visible, users with an
     older Workbench will see double backslashes.
    -Included Danish catalog. Thanks to Claus Jacobsen.
    -Included  German  catalog.  Thanks to Walter Dörwald. Walter also
     made  a  german  translation  of  the  guide, it is available via
     AmiNET (dev/misc/CatEditGermGuide.lha).
    -Included  Swedish catalog.  Thanks to Roger Andersson  and Magnus
     Holmgren.
    -Included  latest  release  of the reqtools.library, version 2.1f.
     Thanks to Nico François.

  ·release 1.1a [38.923 (5.1.94)]
    -CatEdit  no longer  crashes when  you quit  it while  MungWall is
     running.
    -Included  latest release  of the  reqtools.library,  version 2.2.
     Thanks to Nico François.

  ·release 1.1b [38.928 (31.3.94)]
    -@{"String gadget" link stringgadget}  allows movement to  next/previous word with <Alt>
     <Right>/<Left>, and next/previous '\\n' with  <Ctrl><Right>/<Left>
     cursor. Suggestion by Antonio J. Gomez.
    -String gadget  wasn't  disabled when there was  no catalog loaded
     when CatEdit was started.
    -Included Spanish catalog, by Antonio J. Gomez, thank you Antonio.
     He  also  made a  Spanish  guide,  it  is  available  from AmiNET
     (dev/misc/CatEditEspguide.lha).
    -Removed  small  bug  from  Swedish  catalog  (double  shortcuts),
     reported by Roger Andersson, who made the catalog.
    -Updated the guide. Guide now contains my correct EMail address.

  ·release 1.2 [38.943 (9.8.94)]
    -NEW  FEATURE: @{"Snoop Catalog" link snoop}, patches the locale.library to snoop
     the builtin strings from progams.
    -Added @{"New" link new} menu-item, suggested by Antonio J. Gomez.
    -CatEdit signalled string-names containing lowercase characters as
     invalid. Reported by Adam Sjoegren.
    -The catalog description/translation parser has been improved.
    -CatEdit now opens a larger window.
    -Included Italian catalog by Piergiorgio Ghezzo, thanks.
    -Included French catalog by Pascal Rullier, thanks.
    -Included Polish catalog by Michal Letowski (he also made a Polish
     translation of the Workbench).
    -`Smarter' installation script.
    -The included catalogs do not include the 1.2 strings. The builtin
     English strings will be used when no translation is available.

  ·release 1.2a [38.947 (27.1.95)]
    -@{"New" link new} didn't reset the string count to zero. This lead to problems
     when  scrolling  the  @{"string listview" link stringlistview} with the cursor keys after
     you had used New. Reported by Magnus Holmgren.
    -When CatEdit started @{"snooping" link snoop} a catalog, it didn't return a true
     Catalog  structure. But it still doesn't work with Term...
    -Upped the maximum length for a string name to 128 bytes.
    -If you want to open CatEdit on a public screen you should use the
     @{"PUBSCREEN" link starting}  argument/tool  type,  and  not  PUBLICSCREEN  as  was
     mentioned in the old documentation and icon.
    -CatEdit  lost  some  memory  every  time  it was run. Reported by
     Michal Letowski.
    -Included a 'monitors.cd' and a 'workbench.cd' catalog description
     (they can be used from the Workbench with the 'WorkbenchKeys' and
     'ScreenModeNames' icons).
     'monitors.cd'  contains  the  names for all the screenmodes of an
     AGA Amiga, you can add names for other screenmodes by editing the
     catalog  description, the string number should be the 'ModeID' of
     the screenmode.
     'workbench.cd'  contains  all  the  strings  that are used by the
     Workbench  as  menu  shortcuts.  It's  best  to  edit the catalog
     description  with  a  text  editor and then read it into CatEdit,
     after that you should @{"Merge" link merge} with your old 'workbench.catalog'.

  ·release 1.2b [38.951 (16.3.95)]
    -CatEdit couldn't be started from ToolManager, fixed.
    -CatEdit  didn't  accept catalog  description files  with multiple
     spaces between string name and string attributes, nor hexadecimal
     numbers (starting with a `$'). Reported by Robert Bjorn.
    -FileRequester could contain garbage.
    -CatEdit will remove the path part from the catalog version name.
    -Recompiled with SAS-C 6.55.

@node catalog "CatEdit: Catalogs"
@prev catalog

  @{i}Catalogs @{ui}

  Catalogs  are  files that contain all the translated strings. They are
  normally  placed  in the 'LOCALE:Catalogs/<language>' drawer or in the
  'PROGDIR:Catalogs/<language>'  drawer  ('PROGDIR:'  is  the  directory
  where the program using the catalog resides).

  These  catalogs  are very hard to change by hand, that's where CatEdit
  comes in.

  The  normal  way  to make a catalog is with the 'CatComp' program from
  Commodore,   but  then  you'll  need  a  @{"catalog  description" link cd}  and  a
  @{"catalog translation" link ct}.
@endnode

@node cd "CatEdit: Catalog Descriptions"

  @{i}Catalog Descriptions (.cd) @{ui}

  A catalog description is a normal text file that describes a @{"catalog" link catalog}.
  It  contains  every  string  that  a  program  uses  (in  the original
  language) and the minimum and maximum width for that string.

  The  catalog  description  also contains a name for every string, this
  name  should  only  contain   uppercase  alphanumeric  characters  and
  underscores (0...9A...B_).
@endnode

@node ct "CatEdit: Catalog Translations"
@next ct

  @{i}Catalog Translations (.ct) @{ui}

  A  catalog  translation  is  a  normal  text  file  that describes the
  translation of a @{"catalog" link catalog} in a certain language.

  Within  a  catalog  translation  the  @{"strings" link string} are identified by there
  names,   these   names  should  only  contain  uppercase  alphanumeric
  characters and underscores (0...9A...B_).

  @{i}WARNING: @{ui}a  catalog  translation can't be  used to recreate a catalog,
  so  make  sure that you also have a @{"catalog description" link cd} otherwise the
  catalog translation will be worthless.

@node localized "CatEdit: Localized"
@prev localized
@next localized

  @{i}Localized @{ui}

  For  a  program to be able to work in different languages it has to be
  localized.  That means that it has to look for it strings in the right
  @{"catalog" link catalog}, e.g.  the catalog that describes the strings in the language
  that you selected with the Locale preference editor.
@endnode


@node string "CatEdit: String"
@prev string
@next string

  @{i}String @{ui}

  A  @{"catalog" link catalog}  contains  all  the  strings  that a program uses. CatEdit
  always  keeps  two representations of a string in memory: the original
  (untranslated) string and the new (translated) string.

  In CatEdit, strings can contain several control codes:

               @{b}\\a@{ub}     ASCII 7   (audible bell)
               @{b}\\b@{ub}     ASCII 8   (backspace)
               @{b}\\c@{ub}     ASCII 155 (CSI)
               @{b}\\e@{ub}     ASCII 27  (ESC)
               @{b}\\f@{ub}     ASCII 12  (formfeed)
               @{b}\\n@{ub}     ASCII 10  (newline)
               @{b}\\r@{ub}     ASCII 13  (carriage return)
               @{b}\\t@{ub}     ASCII 9   (tab)
               @{b}\\v@{ub}     ASCII 11  (vertical tab)
               @{b}\\0@{ub}     ASCII 0
               @{b}\\x@{ub}XX   XX is a hexadecimal number

  The @{b}\\o@{ub}OOO control code, to enter octal numbers, is not supported.
@endnode


@node procentcommand "CatEdit: % Commands"
@prev procentcommand
@next procentcommand

  @{i}% Commands@{ui}

  Often  % commands are used in strings to replace numbers or names that
  change during the execution of the program.

  The format of the % commands that CatEdit recognizes is:

    %[arg_pos$][flags][width][.limit][length]type

    arg_pos ordinal position of the argument for this command;
    $       must follow the arg_pos value, if specified;
    flags   only one allowed: '-' specifies left justification;
    width   field width, if the first character is a '0', the field is
            padded with leading 0s;
    .       must precede the field limit value, if specified;
    limit   maximum number of characters to output from a string (only
            valid for %s or %b);
    length  size of input data, can be a 'l';
    type    recognized types are:
              b BSTR,
              d signed decimal,
              D signed  decimal  using   the  locale's  formatting
                conventions,
              u unsigned decimal,
              U unsigned  decimal  using  the  locale's formatting
                conventions,
              x hexadecimal with hex digits in uppercase,
              X hexadecimal with hex digits in lowercase,
              s string and
              c character

  (the right brackets mean that that part is optional)

  You  can  use the arg_pos to change the position of the arguments, for
  example if the original @{"string" link string} was
                     '%ld chickens and %ld eggs'
  you could change it to
                   '%2$ld eggs and %1$ld chickens'
  and the information would still be correct.

  CatEdit  always  checks to see if the original  and new string contain
  the same number and type of % commands.
