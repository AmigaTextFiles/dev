 Updates in AMUL 0.8.99:91
 ------------------------

AMAN v0.610:

	* Improved reliability during resets.
	* Tidied up text messages.
	* Improved '-s' function & fixed bugs therein.

AMULCOM v0.8.99:91

	* AMULCom will no-longer allow "treatas verb" which causes an
	  infinite loop & subsequent guru when executed.
	* Solved some minor problems is displaying or error locations
	  during processing of Lang.Txt

AMUL v0.8.99:91

	* Increased program integrity.
	* Minor increase in general operation speed.
	* Fixed problems in "setarr" and "setdep" actions.
	* AMUL lines connected to serial ports would previously crash
	  when AMan sent reset signals. This problem has been resolved.
	* Minor serial-driver glitches solved.
	* Improved throughput on serial lines.
	* Problem which caused AMan to continuously display "Invalid
	  Message!" when a reset was executed has been solved.
	* 'Super Invisible' players now become invisible too. <Blush!>
	* Modified AMUL's reaction to a Reset at various points. This
	  should be both more efficient and more professional looking.
	* Modified the internal 'ShowFile' function.
	* Improved random number generator.
	* Making a player invisible looses their follower.
	* New command line option: (Direct Serial Line)

		-d <baud> [<device> [<unit> [<RTS>]]]

	  This is EXACTLY as per the Serial Line option ("-s") except
	  AMUL will *NOT* check for carrier. This option allows you to
	  attach a terminal to AMUL WITHOUT a modem (for example,
	  plugging another Amiga into yours via the RS232 port).

	  <baud>   : Desired baud rate or 0 for to use existing settings
	  <device> : Name of the serial device	(default = serial.device)
	  <unit>   : Unit number of the device	(default = 0)
	  <RTS>    : 'Y' for RTS/CTS enabled otherwise disabled

	eg:

		run amul -d 19200 serial.device 0 N
		run amul -d 4800 multiserial.device 4 Y
		run amul -d 9600

	Note: When AMUL is being loaded by another task which is ALREADY
	using the serial port, you MUST specify a baud rate of ZERO (0).
	This tells AMUL to use existing device settings.
