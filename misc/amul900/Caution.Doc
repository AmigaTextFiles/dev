Known Bugs & Peculiarities:

 * When processing a syntax where TWO VERBS are entered in one command,
   you cannot use the variable 'verb' to refer to the secondary verb, eg:
	syntax=verb verb
		treatas verb
   would generate a perpetual loop (and eventually a crash) because the
   variable 'verb' actually refers to the COMMAND VERB. Instead use:
	syntax=verb verb
		treatas noun1
