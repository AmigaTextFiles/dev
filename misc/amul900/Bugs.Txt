Known bugs in AMUL v0.8.995!

 (1) exits() doesn't know about Respond and Error actions.		   ?
 (2) AMUL MAY sometimes seize when there have been five users online. The  ?
     cause of this problem cannot be located; however, it is assumed this
     was cured when the memory-problems were solved. If this bug happens
     to you, please try and remember the EXACT circumstances.
 (3) When changing the state of a multi-located object, AMUL checks if the ?
     lighting of the FIRST room has been altered rather than checking each
     room. This may result in the odd 'It is now light enough to see' when
     you aren't expecting it.

 (4) AMULCom: Room ID's seem to get case sensitive handling!!!
