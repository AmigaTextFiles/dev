 AMUL v0.8.99/93	Release Notes		Oliver Smith
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Module: AMAN	  <modver$0.612>	-----------------------------------

 * No changes made to this release of AMan, but I wanted it to compile with
   a more recent date...

 Module: AMULcom  <modver$0.8.99!93>	-----------------------------------

  * Variables: There are several variable 'prefixes' which allow you can
    use within Lang.Txt and Travel.Txt. They have been available for some
    time, but have suddenly had to make some fixes to them!

	label		eg		Meaning
	?<noun>		?noun2		Value of <noun>
	%<noun>		%door		'damage' value of <noun>
	^<noun>		^noun1		Weight of <noun>
	*<noun>		*receiver	The location of <noun>

    Please note that in previous versions of AMUL '*<noun>' didn't work!

 Module: AMUL     <modver$0.8.99!93>	-----------------------------------

  * Screen Settings: When a local AMUL is loaded it will now AUTOMATICALLY
    copy the current work-bench settings for size/interlace. So if your
    WorkBench screen is set to, say, 656x268 then AMUL will open it's screen
    to the same size. This means that NTSC users can now just 'run amul'.
    The NTSC option remains within AMUL to allow PAL users to save on memory
    usage.

  * Fixed a bug which 'randomly' caused AMUL to crash. An internal function
    'ShowFile' was trying to be tidy with File Handles, and being an
    obedient sort of function, was closing any files it considered had been
    'naughtily' left open ... Unfortunately when a user is logged into an
    AMUL line, they open, and lock, the 'RDS.CMP' (Room Descriptions) file.
    'ShowFile' spotted this and closed the file ... > GURU <!

  * Parser Enhancement: 'Him', 'His' and 'Her' are understood to represent
    the last player mentioned; so:

	give book johnathan, toy him, coin him

    is valid.

 Module: PRECIOUS <modver$0a>		-----------------------------------

  * A few new commands and a few fixes to bits and pieces.

  * Daemon timings all spaced a little more to give a more realistic fake
    of a hyper-busy game.

  * Added a few more 'background' daemons and described a few more rooms.

  * Added the 'obgo' command for Masters to allow you to go to wherever an
    object turns out to be!

 Module: NOTES    <modver$00>		-----------------------------------

  * I'm not sure if anyone has tried to implement a 'steal' facility in any
    games; if so I would be interested to know how you fared and/or any
    suggestions you may have! I'd like to install something along these
    lines, but I'm not sure how much I need to provide... It may sound like
    a skive, but the less I provide the more you CAN do. Please let me know!

  * Mobiles: I intend to implement a rudimentary mobile support for AMUL
    0.9. For those with more memory, there will be an option within AMan to
    load TWO extra copies of AMUL: Daemons and Mobiles while the rest of us
    will have to make do with the one.

  * Some point in the near future I intend to make AMUL generate an alpha
    sorted list of ALL the words it knows in an adventure to vastly speed
    up the parser. However, ADDING this to the existing structures and
    format of AMUL may reduce in massive overheads size-wize. If at all
    possible I would prefer to do a re-work of many major portions of AMUL.

  * In the very near future I plan to make it possible to put multiple
    actions on a command line:
	IF noun2 IS A match THEN inc noun2 & reply "The match lights easily."

  * I would like to add a facility for 'compound conditions'; such as:
	IF noun2 IS A match and noun1 IS a matchbox ...
    or	IF !noun2 IS A match or !noun1 IS a matchbox

  * Also I want to enable you to say:
	IF noun2 IS not A match ...

  * Improved combat facilities including an option for Verbose and Brief
    fight descriptions. You would be able to create a file containing both
    the structure and optional words for combat descriptions. I would
    appreciate it if someone would like to work out some combat 'laws' for
    me. The existing combat functions are extremely naff; all help
    appreciated!

  * When I get chance I WILL finish the documentation! Meanwhile - if anyone
    fancies braving their own go at docs; I'd appreciate it!

  * Containers are bugging me - I ought to do some work on them, but as it
    is I can't even remember where they stand!

  * Gavin: Note that the docs should be included in the archive!

  * I want to add some way of saying 'the NEXT location this object is in'
    so you could do something like the teleports in Leather Godesses of
    Phobos.

  * I have decided, so tough if you don't like it, that I am going to find
    a way of making AMUL slightly more like a natural language. This centres
    around making conditions and actions the same things; this would also
    GREATLY reduce the size of the resulting .CMP files.

  * At some point soon, many of the .CMP files will be merged to reduce
    directory cluttering.

  * To avoid memory fragmentation, I plan to size-up and allocate memory for
    ALL the .CMP files

  * AMULCom leaves one heck of a messy directory, eh? I would like to make
    it place all the .CMP files into a sub-directory called cmp. If anyone
    has any reason to object to this; do so now, or else it'll get done!

  * If you have ANY other suggestions, PLEASE send them in to me at the
    address below. I would ALSO appreciate any games you have written or
    tried to write; I am currently looking for a 'sample adventure'. You
    can contact me via Jon Witty's BBS (MetNet Triangle) but you'll most
    likely end up playing AMUL on there - it's a multi-user BBS!

	KingFisher Software D&EG (Ref: AMUL)
	70 Legsby Avenue,
	Grimsby
	South Humberside
	DN32 0NE

  * I do NOT appreciate sarcastic letters asking if 'Letsby Avinue' does
    exist, nor if DN32 'ONE' is real. ?WHY? would I give a fake address?

  * I plan to write an adventure template or even a program to produce
    one! WOW!

  * I plan to get a secretary and someone to do all my typing, though who-
    ever it is needs to be able to type at aprox 160-200 baud!
