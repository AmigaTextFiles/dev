1. Introduction
===============

The  use  of  2D  (two  dimensions)  vectors  is very common in a lot of new
productions,  mainly due to design reasons.This vectors may look very simple
sometimes but the creation of this vectors aren't so easy because just a few
pixels  distance can  be very important, and edit the vectors until they are
perfect  can  be  really  boring (as lots of coders, graphicians and coder's
slaves  will  know).To  ease  this, Spanish Archer created his own 2D vector
editor, and  later I recoded  his  program  with  lots of new  options. Sure
that a lot of coders did the same but I haven't seen any of them released so
I  decide to release my vector editor, called Vectorama.  I worked part-time
on  it during the last year, testing, adding and improving things.During the
last  days  I  worked to make it more intuitive for the user, maybe you will
find  it  hard to use at first, but with a little of practice you will fully
understand  it;  just  use it to  create  your 2D vectors work and save your 
work to use it in your own productions.

The  resulting  vector  data  file  could  be used only by coders in his own
programs but everybody can use Vectorama to create vectors for the coder.

The  only  limitation  of  Vectorama  are  the 2D, because you can use it to
create or edit vectors, lines and dots.  Some features of Vectorama that you
will  find useful is the possibility to load IFF files and a Genlock mode to
draw  over them, the data is saved in `my standard' vector format, it's 100%
coded in assembly and have lots of options to draw and edit vectors.

You  will  find  funnier and easier to use it than read the instructions, so
look at the keys and give it a try right now.


2. Requirements
===============

The  only  real requirement is the `ReqTools.library' by Nico Francois (yes,
Nico is his first name) that is used to save and load files.

There are two versions of ReqTools.library, one for KickStart 2.0+ and other
for  KickStart  1.x  users.Remember to copy the version you will need in the
LIBS: directory of your boot disk.

This  program  must  work  in  every  AGA/nonAGA Amiga with at least 512K of
memory.  (So this must include every Amiga)


3. Instructions
===============

Vectorama is mainly controlled via Mouse and Keyboard,  the fire button of a
Joystick conected in port 2 is optional.

At  the  botton  of the screen you have a panel with all the info about your
current status.There are some icons indicating the selected options and some
text and numbers with additional data.
Remember  that  the  Panel  is  only to provide information and the Mouse to
operate  in  the  main  screen,  so you can't Select/Activate nothing in the
Panel with the Mouse.

In the main screen you can see your current vector figures. You can move the
screen with the cursor keys, so your vectors aren't limited by screen size.

The controls -[key],(Mouse),{JoyStick}- are :

[ESC]= Exit  Vectorama		(Confirm with LEFT Mouse, abort with RIGHT)
[F1] = Clear Vector Data	(Confirm with LEFT Mouse, abort with RIGHT)
[F5] = Load  Vector Data 	(Vectorama.VM data file)
[F6] = Save  Vector Data 	(Vectorama.VM data file)
 (While the current Poly have only 1 or 2 points the save option is disabled)

[HELP]= Info Panel 		(On/Off)
[F10] = Select between Filled vectors/Line vectors/Single Lines/Dots
[F9]  = Invert Fill
[F8]  = Closed/Open Polygons.
[F7]  = Line to Pointer		(On/Off)

[BackSpace] = Select MODE : DRAW / EDIT / MOVE
 DRAW:	(LEFT)      = Draw New Point
 	(RIGHT)     = Delete Last Point 
	[Right ALT] = Start New Polygon
 	{FIRE}      = Start New Polygon
 	[Left SHIFT]  = Fix X axis  [Right SHIFT]=Fix Y axis (DPaint style)
	[CURSOR Keys] = Move screen.
 EDIT:	(LEFT)       = Edit Mode On  :
				(LEFT) = Select  new coords.
				(RIGHT)= Restore old coords.
 	(RIGHT)      = Select Next Point   
	[Left AMIGA] = Select Next Point
	[Left ALT]   = Select Previous Point
 	{FIRE}       = Select Previous Point
 	[Left SHIFT]  = Fix X axis  [Right SHIFT]=Fix Y axis (DPaint style)
	[Cursor Keys] = Move screen.
 MOVE:	[Cursor Keys] = Move vector points coords.

IFF commands : use a IFF picture as background
[F4]  = Load  IFF picture
[CTRL]= IFF On/off
[F2]  = Darker  IFF colors
[F3]  = Lighter IFF colors
[DEL] = Swap Mouse Colors

Vector Light Table commands : use current vector as background 
[TAB] = Light Table On/Off
[~]   = Clear Light Table	(Confirm with LEFT Mouse, abort with RIGHT)
	(The `~' key is under the `ESC' key)

[CAPS LOCK] = Genlock On/Off

A printed copy of this keys would be useful to use Vectorama.


4. Vector Data Format
=====================

The  format  used to save the vectors is a very standar vector format, maybe
it  will be different to your own format, but it will be very easy to make a
converter  from my format to your own vector format in Basic, C, Amos or any
language  you  like.In  the  last  resort you can contact me to support your
vector format in future releases.

All the data is saved in WORD size (2 bytes) as a binary file (use IncBin).

When saving the last polygon will be automatically closed too.

The origin is (0,0), so you never will find negative values as coordinates X
and  Y  of  a point, if you use negative values, simply substract or use the
MOVE mode (but this isn't recommended)

The  VM  suffix and a number is added at the end of the name when saving the
vector data, just to remenber you that it is a VectoraMa data file.

*  Format used to Save/Load the vectors :
*  VM = Vector Data (Coords + Polys)

 	dc.w	N.Points	; Number of Points (of all Polygons)
	dc.w	Point0x,Point0y,Point1x,Point1y.....
		(Coords of all the points of every Polygon)
		
	dc.w	N.Polygons	; Number of Polygons
	dc.w	N.Points of Polygon1,Point0,Point1,....,Point4,Point0
		(Every Polygon finish with his first point)
	dc.w	N.Points of Polygon2,Point5,Point6,....,Point9,Point5
	dc.w	......Rest of Poligons
	dc.w	0		; End of Vector


Example : 1 cube (4 points) and 1 triangle (3 points)
	dc.w	7		; 4+3=7 Points
	dc.w	0,0,0,10,10,10,10,0	;Coords X,Y of the cube
	dc.w	50,50,40,60,60,40	;Coords X,Y of the Triangle

	dc.w	2		; 1 cube+1 triangle = 2 Polygons
	dc.w	4,0,1,2,3,0	; Cube    : 4 points and which 4 points.
	dc.w	3,4,5,6,4	; Triangle: 3 points and which 3 points.
	dc.w	0		; End of Data	


5. Problems and known bugs
==========================

The `SAVE Vector data' only works when all the polys are complete polys(i.e.
all the polys have at least 3 points).If the last poly have less of 3 points
the  data  won't  be  saved.If your current poly have only 1 or 2 points the
save file requester won't appear and you can't save your data.

Vectorama  isn't  a 100% system friendly program so I recommend don't use it
while  running other Amiga programs with important unsaved data to avoid any
data loss of importance in case of any problem.

The  Genlock  mode  isn't  real,  it  works with Genlocks but using the LACE
mode.If  you  have  a  Genlock  and  you  want the real Genlock version just
contact me and I will send you it.

You  can only load IFF pictures of 320x256 pixels (or 320xY, with Y<256) and
the  maximun  number  of  colors  is  32,  if  you want to use other type of
picture, reduce the size and number of colors with your paint program.

I  recommend  saving  to  RAM:   or  RAD:  because sometimes floppy and hard
drives  aren't  validated until you exit VectoRAMa.To avoid this problem use
RAM: and RAD: drives, and at exit copy the VM data to your drive.

If  you  load a file that isn't a real Vectorama.VM file a GURU could be the
result, so don't try to load `Hired Guns' as a VM file.

This  version  was  finished  a  few  hours before it was released, I did an
intensive  testing  to remove all bugs, but be sure there are some very well
hidden bugs waiting inside.If you find any of them or any other problem send
me a detailed report of the error and your machine, and I will try to fix it
and send you the new version.


6. What is OriginalWare ?
=========================

This  utility  is  OriginalWare.That means if you like this program you must
buy an original Amiga program or game or send the money to the author of any
ShareWare(if you don't send it already) program or game you are using often.

There  are lots  of  great  Amiga software like  `DiskMaster', `Hired Guns', 
`Syndicate',  `Goal',  `Cannon  Fodder',  `Pinball  Fantasies',  `Stardust',
`Elfmania'  and  a lot more that you won't never regret to spend your money.

If you do this you support Amiga and if you support AMIGA you support US.

For  more information or suggestions about the OriginalWare concept, contact
me, please.

Support OriginalWare software and you will get more and better software.
