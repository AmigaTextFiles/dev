hreset will do a 'hard' reset of your 4000.
It does not depend on Reboot() and uses the official C= code for reseting,
and then some. The 'hard' part is that it will destroy _AbsExecBase.
It seems that MapRom is smart enough to checksum the memory it uses for the
loaded kickstart to see if there is an ok kickstart there alreay, and if yes
it will just fix the _AbsExecBase. That is what it looks like to me at least.
