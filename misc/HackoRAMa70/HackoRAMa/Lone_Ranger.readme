This program will allocate 512K of memory and map it in at address $C00000.
You can not free this memory, only a reboot will fix that.
The memory is not added to the memory list so that if a program tries to
AllocAbs() in the $C00000 range it will fail.
The memory is mapped as writeable and readable for all, and is not cached in
any way.

If you actually have memory at $C00000 nothing will happen.

THIS PROGRAM DEPENDS ON ENFORCER AND mmu.library BEING ACTIVE!
