		    -------                             
		                                        
		 AS WE BEGAN TO WRITE THE FILLED VECTOR 
		 ROUTINES FOR MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE WE GOT  
		 NERVED OF ALL THE FUCKING COORDS       
		 WHICH HAD TO BE WRITTEN.               
		                                        
		 THE FIRST VERSION OF THE VECTOR        
		 DESIGNER WAS BORN. BUT IT WAS A LONG   
		 WAY TO REALIZE IT.                     
		 IT TOOK MORE TIME TO WRITE A FIRST     
		 VERSION OF THIS UTIL THAN ALL ROUTINES 
		 FOR MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE .....            
		                                        
		 MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE WAS READY.           
		 WITHOUT THE HELP OF THIS GOLDEN PIECE   
		 IT WOULDN`T BE POSSIBLE...             
		                                        
		 NOW WE RECOGNIZED HOW HARD IT IS TO    
		 MAKE A FILLED VECTOR DEMO WITHOUT A    
		 VECTOR DESIGNER.                       
		                                        
		 SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE A VERSION FOR    
		 THE SCENE BUT ALSO OF COURSE FOR ALL   
		 OTHER DUDES WHO CAN NEED THIS TOOL.    
		 IT IS FOR ALL THE TIRED CODERS AND     
		 COORDSWRITING-SLAVES TO HELP THEM BY   
		 THEIR LOUSY WORK.                      
		                                        
		 BY THE WAY THERE ARE NO MORE PROBLEMS  
		 WITH THE TWO DISK VERSION OF MAXIMUM   
		 OVERDRIVE BECAUSE FLAKE MANAGED IT TO  
		 WRITE A BETTER LOADER AND PACKED THE   
		 WHOLE SHIT ON ONE DISK.                
		                                        
		 SO IF YOU HAVENT THE UPDATED ONE DISK  
		 VERSION OF THE MAGNIFICIENT MAXIMUM    
		 OVERDRIVE IN YOUR DEMO COLLECTION THEN 
		 SEND ONE DISK AND A PREPAID ENVELOPE   
		 TO THE FOLLOWING ADRESS.

		 THE SOURCE(SEKA) OF THIS DESIGNER IS   
		 VERY CHAOTIC BECAUSE ALLOC WROTE THIS  
		 UNDER HEAVY TIME PRESSURE FOR MAXIMUM  
		 OVERDRIVE. FIRST WE DON`T WANT TO MAKE 
		 A RELEASE OF THIS CRAP.                
		 THIS IS THE REASON WHY THIS DESIGNER   
		 ISN`T VERY `USER FRIENDLY`.            
		 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET REAL STRUCTURE
		 IN THIS SOURCE WITHOUT WRITING IT      
		 TOTALY NEW......                       
		 YOU HAVEN`T THE HELP OF A DIRECTORY OR 
		 PULL DOWN MENUES.                      
		 THIS IS A NAKED PROGRAM BUT WHAT       
		 REMAINS IS THE POWERFUL USE OF THIS    
		 TOOL.                                  
		 WE ALSO INCLUDED A SPECIAL SAVE OPTION 
		 FOR THE RED SECTOR DEMOMAKER AS WE     
		 NOTICED THAT THERE WAS NO DESIGNER IN  
		 THAT FUNNY TOOL.                       
		 SO NOW YOU CAN MAKE YOUR RED SECTOR    
		 DEMOS WITH INCLUDING YOUR OWN MADE     
		 OBJECTS EASILY.                        
		                                        
		 BY THE WAY. THERE IS A SPECIAL BROTHERS
		 DEMO MADE WITH THE RED SECTOR DEMOMAKER
		 FLYING THROUGH THE SCENE.              
		 PLEASE NOTICE THAT THIS IS NOT FROM US.
		 `HOW LOW CAN WE GO` ???? NOT SO LOW ,  
		 OKAY DUDES...                          
		 WE THINK THAT WAS ONLY A LAME JOKE FROM
		 SOME FREAKS OUT OF IRAQ !!!!!!!!

		 VIII. SPECIAL HELP & HINTS             
		 --------------------------             
		                                        
		                                        
		 - WHEN YOU CREATE THE FACES OF YOUR    
		   OBJECT IN [F2] F-EDIT REMEMBER TO    
		   BORDER THEM IN CLOCKWISE-DIRECTION!! 
		                                        
		 - FOR DESIGNING YOUR OBJECT USE ALWAYS 
		   A POINTERSTEP RANGE !!!!             
		   THIS WILL HELP YOU VERY MUCH.        
		                                        
		 - WHEN YOU ARE READY WITH DESIGNING    
		   YOUR OBJECT MAKE SURE THAT THE LAST  
		   POSITION OF POINTS, FACES, TABLES    
		   AND ETC. MUST BE EMPTY. THE DESIGNER 
		   WILL KILL THE POSITION BY SAVING IT  
		   AS A READY FILE.                     
		   THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!      
		                                        
		 - BEFORE TESTING A OBJECT WITH [TAB]   
		   SAVE IT AS A DATA FILE ([F5]) !!!    
		   IF YOU MADE SHIT IN CREATING YOUR    
		   FACES OR FORGOT THE LAST FREE        
		   POSITION IN  ANY TABLE THIS WONDERFUL
		   MACHINE WILL FUCK UP.                
		                                        
		 - WHEN YOU USE THE OBJECTS IN THE RSI  
		   DEMOMAKER MAKE SURE THAT YOUR OBJECT 
		   COORDS ARE NOT TOO BIG.              
		                                        
		   - WHEN YOU ENTERED IN THE RSI OBJECT 
		     SOURCE A ZOOM FROM 300 THE RANGE   
		     OF THE OBJECT COORDS SHOULD NOT BE 
		     BIGGER THAN FROM -100 TO 100 IN    
		     ALL AXIS.                          
		                                        
		 - WE NOT REALLY TESTED ALL OPTIONS OF  
		   RSI DEMOMAKER BUT SO WE DID ALL WENT
