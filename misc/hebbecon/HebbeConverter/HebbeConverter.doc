DISCLAIMER
~~~~~~~~~~
I can't take any responsibility for any damage this program does to your
equipment or software installed on your computer. However, it has been
fully tested and should work perfectly well on all amigas stated below.


REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program has been tested on the following machines:

A1200,2 meg chip, OS3.0
A600,1 meg chip, OS2.04

OS2.04 is required, since it uses Reqtools v38, (c) Nico Francois.

If it doesn't work on your machine, or you come upon any other problem
while using this program, then send me an email or letter telling me
about it.


INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just copy the program where you want it. The file reqtools.library should
be copied into your libs: directory, if you don't have it installed already.


USING THE PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With this program you can convert numbers between binary, decimal and
hexadecimal. Just enter the number you want to convert in one of the
stringgadgets and the result appears in the other gadgets. Simpel!
However, you cannot enter what you want in the gadgets. In the "bin"-gadget
only 1:s and 0:s are excepted, in the "dec"-gadget only digits 1 to 9,
and in the "hex"-gadget digits 1 to 9 and letters "a" to "f". If you enter
anything else or a number which is to high in the "dec"-gadget (nothing
higher than 2 147 483 647 is accepted) than you'll get no answer.
