                       TdDBase.Library demos V1
                           © 1996 BetaSoft


 TdDBase.Library is a standard shared library containing an easy to use and
 yet powerfull database engine. 


  The folowing demos are included in this archive
    @{" Benchmark        " link Bench} - Calculates benchmark on your computer.
    @{" Changes & Notify " link Notify} - Shows how notification between programms work.
    @{" MMBase           " link MMBase} - A complete database application.

  And if those didnt convince you that this is what you need you can take
  a glims at these files to:
    @{" Featurelist  " link features}
    @{" Autodocs.txt " link Autodocs.txt/main}

 TdDBase.Library is what someone would call ShareWare but I tend to call it
 LicensWare instead. This is what you get for your licensmoney:

  * The right to freely distribute this library with all your software (this
    also includes SW/Commercial software!).
  * Full access to the support page where you always can download the latest
    devtools to help you make even more advanced programms. (you can see
    them on http://www.algonet.se/~betasoft/database/support.html but you
    cant download any of them)
  * Save over 800 working hours and 3 years of development.
  * Lifetime support.

  All this for only 300 SEK,$44, 67 DM, 39 UKP or whatever that is in your
  local currency.

@node Bench "Benchmark"

                         Benchmark 1.2


Benchmark is a small programm that not only shows how the library but it
also calculates some "basic" benchmarks (Now THAT is news, isnt it :).

When run it will start doing some test using 50 database files that is
created in the current directory and output the results to stdout (usualy
the shellwindow from where it was started even if it can be run from
WorkBench).

    ----------------- Example output ------------------

Deleting files...

    -------------- End of output ---------------

The given number are first the total number of seconds the operation took
(divide by 50 to get the time/database) and the second are the time
recalculated into number of operations per second.

@node Notify "Notify & Changes"

                       Notify and Changes 1.1


These 2 programms shows how easy it is to recive information of what other
programms are doing to a database that you also have access to.

When you start notify it will open or create the database Example.DBS in the
current directory and start listening after UpdateMessages until you press
CTRL-C and stops the programm.

Then when you run changes, Notify should come alive and start printing info
about what Changes is doing.

@endnode

@node MMBase "MultiMedia DataBase (MMBase)"

                           MMBase 1.0


And now an example of a real database-application. When started it will
open/create a database called PROGDIR:MMBase.DBS and open a small window on
the deafult public screen.

To add a file to this database, you select project/New Node... to open a
file requester asking you what file you wish to add. If you chosed OK it
will create a new node and placing you in it. Now you can enter a comment
and by presing enter it will also be saved to the database. Now you can
press Show and let multiview (Must be in your path) view the file for you.

Thanks to this library and GadToolsBox it only took me 5 hours and 45
minutes to design the GUI and all the code for it.

@node features "Features"

 A small (and incomplete?) list of all features that TdDBase.Library gives you

  * Doesnt need fixed sizes for nodes,strings and other data.
  * Contains a smart cache that automaticly adjust's iself to the amount
    of available RAM and the 
  * Alows several programms to use the same database at the same time and
    even letting them know what the other programms are doing.
  * Makes sharing of databases between programms very easy, and programms
    can even add their own private fields without disturbing other
    programms that uses the same database.
  * Has powerfull functions for recordlocking.
  * Contains a powerfull search routine that gives the programmer full
    control over how and where to search.
  * Is only 11k in size.
  * Copies nodes and whole databases.
  * Nodes can be swaped, letting you define your own sort criterias.


 Why should you use this library and not any one else's?

 * You want to create and and use huge databases that doesnt fit into
   RAM (unless you have some huge amount of ram that is :).
  * You does not want your database to be spread out into hundreds of files.
  * You want fast access to all your data (Try that benchmark if you dont
    belive me when I say its fast).
  * You want to recive help when you have problems.
  * You dont want to pay any extras just because you want to use it in
    a shareware or commercial programm (Yes you read right, there are
    no other fees except the inital registration fee).


 Programms that uses this database engine curently includes

 * TidningsRegister wich is a complete set of database systems for magazines
    (this realy includes every thing that can be stored in a database also).
 * SerieSystem wich is a result database/chart generator.
