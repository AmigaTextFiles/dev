ioblixser.device/AbortIO                               ioblixser.device/AbortIO

   NAME
       AbortIO(ioRequest) -- abort an I/O request
               A1

   FUNCTION
      This is an exec.library call.

      This function attempts to aborts a specified read or write request.
      If the request is active, it is stopped immediately. If the request is
      queued, it is painlessly removed.  The request will be returned
      in the same way any completed request it.

      After AbortIO(), you must generally do a WaitIO().

   INPUTS
      IORequest  -- pointer to the IORequest Block that is to be aborted.

   RESULTS
       io_Error -- if the Abort succeded, then io_Error will be #IOERR_ABORTED

           (-2) and the request will be flagged as aborted (bit 5 of 
           io_Flags is set).  If the Abort failed, then the Error will be zero.


ioblixser.device/BeginIO                               ioblixser.device/BeginIO

   NAME
       BeginIO(ioRequest),deviceNode -- start up an I/O process
                A1        A6
   FUNCTION
       This is a direct function call to the device.  It is intended for
       more advanced programmers.  See exec's DoIO() and SendIO() for
       the normal method of calling devices.

       This function initiates a I/O request made to the serial
       device. Other than read or write, the functions are performed 
       synchronously, and do not depend on any interrupt handling 
       logic (or it's associated discontinuities), and hence should
       be performed as IO_QUICK.
       With some exceptions, reads and writes are merely initiated by 
       BeginIO, and thusly return to the caller as begun, not completed.
       Completion is signalled via the standard ReplyMsg routine.
       Multiple requests are handled via FIFO queueing.
       One exception to this non-QUICK handling of reads and writes
       is for READS when:
         - IO_QUICK bit is set
         - There are no pending read requests
         - There is already enough data in the input buffer to satisfy
           this I/O Request immediately.
       In this case, the IO_QUICK flag is not cleared, and the request
       is completed by the time it returns to the caller. There is no
       ReplyMsg or signal bit activity in this case.
          
   INPUTS
       ioRequest  -- pointer to an I/O Request Block of size 
           io_ExtSerSize (see serial.i for size/definition), 
           containing a valid command in io_Command to process,
           as well as the command's other required parameters.
       deviceNode -- pointer to the "ioblixser.device", as found in
           the IO_DEVICE of the ioRequest.

   RESULTS
       io_Error -- if the BeginIO succeded, then Error will be null.
           If the BeginIO failed, then the Error will be non-zero.
           I/O errors won't be reported until the io completes.

ioblixser.device/CloseDevice                       ioblixser.device/CloseDevice

   NAME
       CloseDevice -- close the serial port

   SYNOPSIS
       CloseDevice(deviceNode)
                    A1
   FUNCTION
       This is an exec call that terminates communication with the
       serial device.  Upon closing, the device's input buffer is freed.

       Note that all IORequests MUST be complete before closing.
        If any are pending, your program must AbortIO() then WaitIO()
       to complete them.

   INPUTS
       deviceNode - pointer to the device node, set by Open

ioblixser.device/CMD_CLEAR                           ioblixser.device/CMD_CLEAR

   NAME
       Clear -- clear the serial port buffers

   FUNCTION
       This command resets the serial port's read buffer pointers.

   IO REQUEST
       io_Message      mn_ReplyPort initialized
       io_Device       set by OpenDevice
       io_Unit         set by OpenDevice
       io_Command      CMD_CLEAR

   RESULTS
       Error -- If the Clear succeded, then io_Error will be null.
                If the Clear failed, then the io_Error will be non-zero.


ioblixser.device/CMD_FLUSH                           ioblixser.device/CMD_FLUSH

   NAME
       Flush -- clear all queued I/O requests for the serial port

   FUNCTION
       This command purges the read and write request queues for the
       serial device. Flush will not affect active requests.

   IO REQUEST
       io_Message      mn_ReplyPort initialized
       io_Device       set by OpenDevice
       io_Unit         set by OpenDevice
       io_Command      CMD_FLUSH

   RESULTS
       Error -- if the Flush succeded, then io_Error will be null.
                 If the Flush failed, then the io_Error will be non-zero.


ioblixser.device/CMD_READ                             ioblixser.device/CMD_READ

   NAME
       Read -- read input from serial port

   FUNCTION
        This command causes a stream of characters to be read in from
        the serial port buffer.  The number of characters is specified
        in io_Length.

        The Query function can be used to check how many characters
        are currently waiting in the serial port buffer.  If more characters
        are requested than are currently available, the ioRequest
        will be queued until it can be satisfied.


        The best way to handle reads is to first Query to get the number
        of characters currently in the buffer.  Then post a read request
        for that number of characters (or the maximum size of your buffer).

        If zero characters are in the buffer, post a request
        for 1 character.  When at least one is ready, the device will return
        it.  Now start over with another Query.

        Before the program exits, it must be sure to AbortIO() then WaitIO()
        any outstanding ioRequests.

   IO REQUEST
       io_Message      A mn_ReplyPort is required
       io_Device       set by OpenDevice
       io_Unit         set by OpenDevice
       io_Command      CMD_READ
       io_Flags        If the IOB_QUICK bit is set, read will try
                        to complete the IO quickly
       io_Length       number of characters to receive.
       io_Data         pointer to buffer

   RESULTS
       Error -- if the Read succeded, then io_Error will be null.
           If the Read failed, then io_Error will be non-zero.
             io_Error will indicate problems such as parity mismatch,
             break, and buffer overrun.

        ioblixser.device/SDCMD_SETPARAMS

   BUGS
        Having multiple outstanding read IORequests at any one time will
        probably fail.

        Old documentation mentioned a mode where io_Length was set to -1.
        If you want a NULL terminated read, use the io_TermArray instead.


ioblixser.device/CMD_RESET                           ioblixser.device/CMD_RESET

   NAME
       Reset -- reinitializes the serial port

   FUNCTION
       This command resets the serial port to its freshly initialized
       condition. It aborts all I/O requests both queued and current,
       relinquishes the current buffer, obtains a new default sized
       buffer, and sets the port's flags and parameters to their 
       boot-up time default values. The functions places the reset
       parameter values in the ioRequest block.

   IO REQUEST
       io_Message      mn_ReplyPort initialized
       io_Device       set by OpenDevice
       io_Unit         set by OpenDevice
       io_Command      CMD_RESET

   RESULTS
       Error -- if the Reset succeded, then Error will be null.
           If the Reset failed, then the Error will be non-zero.

   NAME
       Start -- restart paused I/O over the serial port

   FUNCTION
       This function restarts all current I/O on the serial port by 
       sending an xON to the "other side", and submitting a "logical
       xON" to "our side", if/when appropriate to current activity.

   FUNCTION
       This command halts all current I/O on the serial port by 
       sending an xOFF to the "other side", and submitting a "logical
       xOFF" to "our side", if/when appropriate to current activity.

   NAME
       Write -- send output to serial port

   FUNCTION
       This command causes a stream of characters to be written out
       the serial port. The number of characters is specified in
       io_Length, unless -1 is used, in which case output is sent until
       a null(0x00) is encountered. 

   IO REQUEST
       io_Message      must have mn_ReplyPort initialized

   SYNOPSIS
       chipInfo = GetChipInfo(ioRequest)
       D0                     A0

        BYTE OpenDevice(STRPTR, ULONG, struct IOExtSer *, ULONG);

   FUNCTION
       This is an exec call.  Exec will search for the ioblixser.device, and
       if found, will pass this call on to the device.

       Unless the shared-access bit (bit 5 of io_SerFlags) is set,
       exclusive use is granted and no other access to that unit is
       allowed until the owner closes it.  All the serial-specific fields
       in the ioRequest are initialized to their most recent values (or
       the Preferences default, for the first time open).

       If support of 7-wire handshaking (i.e. RS232-C CTS/RTS protocol)
       is required, use the ioblixser.device/SDCMD_SETPARAMS command.
       This feature should also be specified at inital OpenDevice() time.

   INPUTS
       "ioblixser.device"  - pointer to literal string "ioblixser.device"
       unit             - Must be zero, or a user setable unit number.
                          (This field is used by multiple port controllers)
                          Zero specifies the default serial port.
       ioRequest        - pointer to an ioRequest block of size io_ExtSerSize
                          to be initialized by the ioblixser.device.
                          (see devices/serial.h for the definition)
                          NOTE use of io_SerFlags (see FUNCTION above)
                IMPORTANT: The ioRequest block MUST be of size io_ExtSerSize,
                           and zeroed (with the exeptions as noted)!
       flags            - Must be zero for future compatibility

   RESULTS
       D0         - same as io_Error
       io_Error  - If the Open succeded, then io_Error will be null.
                    If the Open failed, then io_Error will be non-zero.
       io_Device - A pointer to whatever device will handle the calls
                   for this unit.  This pointer may be different depending
                   on what unit is requested.

   NAME
       Break -- send a break signal over the serial line

   FUNCTION
       This command sends a break signal (serial line held low for an
       extended period) out the serial port.

       After a duration (user specifiable via setparams, default 250000
       microseconds) the bit is reset and the signal discontinued.
       If the QUEUEDBRK bit of io_SerFlags is set in the io_Request 
       block, the request is placed at the back of the write-request 
       queue and executed in turn. If the QUEUEDBRK bit is not set, 
       the break is started immediately, control returns to the 
       caller, and the timer discontinues the signal after the 
       duration is completed. Be aware that calling BREAK may
       affect other commands such as ABORT, FLUSH, STOP, START, etc...

ioblixser.device/SDCMD_SETPARAMS               ioblixser.device/SDCMD_SETPARAMS

   NAME
       SetParams -- change parameters for the serial port

   FUNCTION
       This command allows the caller to change parameters for the
       serial device. Except for xON-xOFF enable/disable, it will
       reject a setparams call if any reads or writes are active 
       or pending. 
       Note specifically:

    1. Valid input for io_Baud is between 110 and 921600 baud inclusive;
       asynchronous i/o above 32KB (especially on a busy system) may
       be ambitious.
    2. The EOFMODE and QUEUEDBRK bits of io_SerFlags can be set/reset 
       in the io_Rqst block without a call to SetParams. The SHARED 
       and 7WIRE bits of io_SerFlags can be used in OpenDevice calls.
       ALL OTHER PARAMETERS CAN ONLY BE CHANGED BY THE SetParams 
       COMMAND.
    3. RBufLen must be at least 64.  The buffer may be any multiple of
        64 bytes.
    4. If not used, io_ExtFlags MUST be set to zero.
    5. xON-xOFF is by default enabled. The XDISABLED bit is the only
       parameter that can be changed via a SetParams call while the
       device is active. Note that this will return the value
       SerErr_DevBusy in the io_Error field.
        
        xON/xOFF handshaking is inappropriate for certain binary transfer
        protocalls, such as Xmodem.  The binary data might contain the
        xON (ASCII 17) and xOFF (ASCII 19) characters.

    6. If trying to run MIDI, you should set the RAD_BOOGIE bit of
       io_SerFlags to eliminate unneeded overhead. Specifically, this skips
       checks for parity, x-OFF handling, character lengths other than
       8 bits, and testing for a break signal. Setting RAD_BOOGIE will
       also set the XDISABLED bit.
       Note that writing data (that's already in MIDI format) at MIDI rates
       is easily accomplished. Using this driver alone for MIDI reads may,
       however, may not be reliable, due to MIDI timestamping requirements,
       and possibility of overruns in a busy multitasking and/or display
       intensive environment.
    7. If you select mark or space parity (see io_ExtFlags in serial.h),
       this will cause the SERB_PARTY_ON bit to be set, and the setting
       of SERB_PARTY_ODD to be ignored.
    8. For best results, set the RAD_BOOGIE flag whenever possible.  See
        #6 for details.
    9. Note that at this time parity is *not* calculated for the xON-xOFF
        characters.  If you have a system that is picky about the parity of
        these, you must set your own xON-xOFF characters in io_CtlChar.
   10. 7WIRE (CTS/RTS) handshake is bi-directional.  The external side
        is expected to drop CTS several character times before the external
        buffer is full.  The IOBlix-UART will drop RTS several character times
        before the IOBlix-UART's buffer is full.

                        NOTE that the following fields are filled in by Open 
                       to reflect the serial device's current configuration.
       io_CtlChar      a longword containing byte values for the
                       xON,xOFF,INQ,ACK fields (respectively)
                       (INQ/ACK not used at this time)
       io_RBufLen      length in bytes of input buffer
                        NOTE that any change in buffer size causes the
                       current buffer to be deallocated and a new,
                       correctly sized one to be allocated. Thusly,
                       the CONTENTS OF THE OLD BUFFER ARE LOST.
       io_ExtFlags     additional serial flags (bitdefs in devices/serial.h)
                        mark & space parity may be specified here.
       io_Baud         baud rate for reads AND writes. (See 1 above)
       io_BrkTime      duration of break signal in MICROseconds
       io_TermArray    ASCII descending-ordered 8-byte array of
                       termination characters. If less than 8 chars
                       used, fill out array w/lowest valid value.
                       Terminators are checked only if EOFMODE bit of
                       io_Serflags is set. (e.g. x512F040303030303 )
       io_ReadLen      number of bits in read word (1-8) not including parity
       io_WriteLen     number of bits in write word (1-8) "      "       "
       io_StopBits     number of stop bits (0, 1 or 2)
       io_SerFlags     see devices/serial.h for bit equates, NOTE that x00
                       yields exclusive access, xON/OFF-enabled, no
                       parity checking, 3-wire protocol and TermArray
                       inactive.

   RESULTS
       Error -- if the SetParams succeded, then Error will be null.
           If the SetParams failed, then the Error will be non-zero.

   NAME
       SetCTRLLines -- set state of RTS and DTR line

   FUNCTION
       This command allows the caller to directly set the RTS and DTR lines to
       a specific state.

   IO REQUEST
       io_Message      mn_ReplyPort initialized
       io_Device       preset by OpenDevice
       io_Unit         preset by OpenDevice
       io_Command      SIOCMD_SETCTRLLINES
       io_Offset       mask which specifies the lines that are to be changed
       io_Length       mask which defines the new state of affected lines

   EXAMPLE
       /* drop the DTR line */
       ioreq->io_Command = SIOCMD_SETCTRLLINES;
       ioreq->io_Offset = SIOF_DTR; /* set new state of DTR line    */
       ioreq->io_Length = 0;        /* new state is low             */
       DoIO(ioreq);

       /* raise DTR again */
       ioreq->io_Command = SIOCMD_SETCTRLLINES;
       ioreq->io_Offset = SIOF_DTR; /* set new state of DTR line    */
       ioreq->io_Length = SIOF_DTR; /* new state is high            */
       DoIO(ioreq);

   RESULTS
       The RTS and DTR lines will be set to the specified state.

       io_Error -- SetCTRLLines will always succeded.
