    I must say that it has been far too long since the last issue of @{b}The
Source@{ub} was released.  It was nearly one year ago!  So much has changed
in the demo scene and with the Amiga in general, that it somehow seems
fitting that the changes in @{b}The Source@{ub} should also be great. The
first change that must be noticed is that all of the articles are in
AmigaGuide format.  I would have prefered to use HTML, but I don't know
of any wide spread HTML viewer for the Amiga.  The second change is that
there are not nearly as many utilities.  This will be somewhat of a
permanent change.  Nearly all of the utilities that would be here are
available else where.

    There is also a new feature.  A section of book reviews has been added.
In the future I would like to reviews of books on all aspects of programming,
but for now graphics and hardware bashing will do.

    If you wisht to contact Epsilon for any reason, be it submiting articles
or telling us how cool we are :), send e-mail to: Epsilon@matrix.rain.com.
That about wraps it up for now, until next time, happy coding!

@node CGH_Review
Mortenson, Michael E., @{b}Computer Graphics Handbook: Geometry and Mathematics@{ub}
    Industrial Press Inc., New York, ISBN 0-8311-1002-3

    This book is not a typical graphics book, but it is exactly what  The
title says it is.  It is a handbook of geometry and mathematics.  The book
covers the mathematical and geometric aspects of a wide variety of graphics
issues.  From polygons to curves to surfaces to display geometry and every
thing in between.

    I have owned this book for quite a few months now, and have been surprised
to not see it on any of the lists of "must have" graphics books.  Every time
I try to tackle a new graphics issue, I find myself returning to this book.

    While this book does cover a wide spectrum of topics, its heavy emphasis
on mathematics may make it difficult for some people to use.  Some of the
deriations are also a bit thin, but all of the major points are covered.

    All things considered, I find that this book should have a home in every
graphics programmer's library.
