        Here are some important things that you should do to install 
        properly MVR to your harddrive.


                File MVR.CONFIG must exists in the same directory where
        is MVRv2.0 or it must exist in the path written in the MVR.DATA.

                File MVR.DATA is important if you wish to use several
        documents, scripts, so if he exist (he must be also in the same
        directory) on the start MVR will ask you to choose one of the
        scripts.If there are several you can choose one of them by just
        simple clicking on the document you wish to use.

                All text files called by MVR must have MVR instructions,
        at least theese two SCR and END (see MVR instructions for more
        details).

                All files used in MVR.CONFIG must exists (fonts, modules,
        texts, pictures etc..) or MVR will not work.
