@node AMOSE " About AMOS Extensions on this disk  "

   We presents you two new extensions for AMOSPRO.

                -AMOSPro_Music.Lib
                -AMOSPro_RNC.Lib

Theese extensions are PublicDomain/ShareWare !!!

* AMOSPro_Music.Lib (MAD VIRGIN MUSIC EXTENSION V1.76)

        This is an old amos music extension but with some new commands and 
        fixed bugs. If you want to use it just overwrite your old extension.

        Fixed bugs
        -----------
        -flash screen bug on the tracker loop exists no more
        -no more loop play bug (repeat 0 pattern)
        -Exx command set is added (except tempo EFx command)
        -Bxx and Dxx commands work correctly now
        -Fxx command just ignore tempo 
        -9xx command is added (sample offset)
        -all commands work fine except tempo command (Fxx and EFx) ...


        Added commands
        --------------
      > Tvolume n command influences on the tracker main volume.
        This command is compatible with Mvolume n command.
        n range is (0-63) - volume for all tracker channels.

      > Tchannel On/Off n command turns on/off tracker channel n and it makes
        possible to play samples, with Sam Play command, when module plays.

        Values for n are:

        1 - channel 0 (%0001) on/off
        2 - channel 1 (%0010) on/off
        3 - channel 2 (%0100) on/off
        4 - channel 3 (%1000) on/off
        0 - all channels on/off.

      > Track on command starts protracker play routine.

      > Mad on command starts TMMC play routine (MAD VIRGIN new improved 
        routine). AMOS use this command as default.
        For playing Tracker module, you must use Track on command. 



* AMOSPro_RNC.Lib (MAD VIRGIN RNC UNPACKER V1.0)

        This extesion have only one command but it's very useful.
        Extension number is 11 !!!

        Rnc unpack method,bank1 to bank2,offset
        This command unpack the ProPacker packing code.

        Method - 1 or 2 
        Bank1  - memory bank of the propackered data file
        Bank2  - destination memory bank of the unpacked data
                 this bank will be created by the command
        Offset - number of bytes which will be added to memory bank2 adress

        Example:

@node INST " Installation of MAD VIRGIN Reader        "


        Here are sme important things that you should do to install 
        properly MVR to your harddrive.


                File MVR.CONFIG must exists in the same directory where
        is MVRv2.0 or it must exist in the path written in the MVR.DATA.

                File MVR.DATA is important if you wish to use several
        documents, scripts, so if he exist (he must be also in the same
        directory) on the start MVR will ask you to choose one of the
        scripts.If there are several you can choose one of them by just
        simple clicking on the document you wish to use.

                All text files called by MVR must have MVR instructions,
        at least theese two {SCR} and {END} (see MVR instructions for more
        details).

                All files used in MVR.CONFIG must exists (fonts, modules,
        texts, pictures etc..) or MVR will not work.
