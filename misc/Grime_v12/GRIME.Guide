@NODE GRIME-INTRO "Introduction"

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - What is it?@{fg text}@{uu} 

@{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} is designed to enable the user to create maps for his/her games in
an easy, user-friendly environment.

As you may know, almost all games that have large playing areas, usually 
use a map to store the layout of each of the levels. The way this works is 
a screen of graphics is designed in an art package, this screen contains 
small blocks of graphics which when placed together in various patterns 
produce the final graphics.  A map is then created that just contains the 
numbers of the blocks in the order that they should appear.

An example.

        The graphics screen would look something like this @{" View Graphics " link GRIME:IFFs/cheeseygrimegrafx.iff/main}

        Then the map could look something like this:-

	7  2  3  2  10
	1  0  1  0  1
	6  2  11 2  5
	1  0  1  0  1
	8  2  4  2  9

        Which would produce a screen like this @{" View Example " link GRIME:IFFs/cheeseyEXAMPLE.iff/main }

By storing just the numbers of the blocks, rather than entire screens, the
games programmer can save vast amounts of valueable memory.


Example map reading, theory and Squize pretend code...

This is the quickest way ( I know of ) to read and display a map...
First of all you will need a list of pointers, each one points to an 
individual block in memory, eg

	block_pointer1 = Block1
	...
        block_pointerx = Blockx

So, from there we go to...

	Read first value of map			 ;Let's pretend it's 5
.loop
	Read block_pointer1 + the above value	 ;So this will be 
	We now point to the correct block,	 ;block_pointer1 + 5
	Plot it	 				  ;ie block_pointer5
	Read next value of map
	Goto .loop until done

I hope that makes at least some sense, if you would like a complete
assembler version then look out for "SHOAH.s", released 1st Jan '95.

So the aim of @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} is to make the creation of these maps quick and easy.

@NODE GRIME-SCREEN "Screen Layout"

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - What's on the screen mate?@{fg text}@{uu}

Along the top of the main @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} screen you will find the following
information

@WORDWRAP OFF

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       | Info Window           | Current Blk | Under Csr | Map Offset    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

@{fg shine}Information Window@{fg text} - This is used by @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} to give the user information
                     on the current attibutes for the block in current  
                     use. It's also used to give the user information
                     about the current operation being performed.
@{fg shine}Current Block@{fg text}      - The current block being used.
@{fg shine}Under Cursor@{fg text}       - The block currently below the cursor position. 
@{fg shine}Map Offset@{fg text}         - The current position of the cursor within the map or 
                     the block screen.

On the left middle section of the screen is the information about the block
screen.

@{fg shine}Size@{fg text}      - The X and Y dimensions of the the Block screen.
@{fg shine}Colours@{fg text}   - The number of colours on the Block screen.
@{fg shine}Blocks@{fg text}    - The Maximum number of blocks on the Block Screen.
@{fg shine}Scr. Res.@{fg text} - The Resolution of the Block Screen.

On the right middle section of the screen is the information about the map
screen.

@{fg shine}Map Size@{fg text}  - The current X and Y size of the map, measured in blocks.
@{fg shine}Blck Sze@{fg text}  - The current X and Y size of the blocks.
@{fg shine}Blocks@{fg text}    - The total number of blocks within the map.
@{fg shine}On Screen@{fg text} - The number of blocks displayed on the map screen.

The centre section contains the current block the previous block and the
next block.

The bottom section of the screen normally display information about your
computer, such as CPU and memory. But can also contain message from @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} to
you the user.

@NODE GRIME-BASIC "Getting started"

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - Ummm... I'm haven't a clue how to use this...@{fg text}@{uu}

@{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} uses three screens in total. The first screen you see upon loading
is @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}'s menu screen, this screen is always partially (if not fully)
visable. The menu screen is used to display various details about the
current Map and Block screens and the current settings, it also has all
the menus attached to it. Only a few of the menu options are available
when you first load @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}, but once you have loaded a block screen into
@{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} all the options will be available and a map screen will be
created. 

To you use @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}'s menus simply move the mouse cursor over @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}'s menu 
screen, if only the upper section of the screen is currently being
displayed then the rest of the screen will be brought to the front.
Then use the right mouse button in the standard Amiga way.

While on the actual map screen the left mouse button is used to paste the
current block down onto the screen. The right mouse button will switch 
from the map screen to the block screen, from here you can select a new
block with the left mouse button, and use the right button to switch back
to the map screen. If either the Map or Block screen is larger than the
screen display then the cursor keys and/or the mouse can be used to move
about the larger area (Depending on the settings in the @{" PREFERENCES Menu " link GRIME-PREFERENCES}).

@NODE GRIME-PROJECT "The Project Menu"

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - Files and the like.@{fg text}@{uu}

The project menu contains the following options.

@{fg shine}Load Block Screen@{fg text} - This allows you to load an IFF file into memory
containing all the blocks for your map. The block file can be bigger than a 
standard screen, as @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} allows you to scroll around the screen.

@{fg shine}Load GRIME Map@{fg text} - Use this option to load in a @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} map. The menu
contains three sub-menus depending on the format you wish to load in.
The options are @{" GRIME format " link GRIME-MAPFILES}, @{" Raw Data in Words " link GRIME-MAPFILES} and
@{" Raw Data in Bytes " link GRIME-MAPFILES}.

@{fg shine}Save GRIME Map As@{fg text} - This option is used to save out the current @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}
map. Again there are three sub-menus to allow you to decide on the format to
save as. The formats are @{" GRIME format " link GRIME-MAPFILES}, @{" Raw Data in Words " link GRIME-MAPFILES} and
@{" Raw Data in Bytes " link GRIME-MAPFILES}.

@{fg shine}Save Palette@{fg text} - This saves out the current file in either @{" AMOS ASCII " link GRIME-PALETTE}

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - Cut, paste...@{fg text}@{uu}

@{fg shine}Cut Block@{fg text} - This allows you to cut a section from the current map. Use the 
left mouse button to select the upper left section of the block, then
move the mouse to the bottom right block of the section and click the
left mouse button again. At any time pressing the right mouse button will
cancel the operation. Once you have selected the area, the section will
be cut out and the @{" Base Block " link GRIME-SETTINGS} will be placed in the section.

@{fg shine}Paste Block@{fg text} - This option is used to place the current Copy Buffer onto
the map screen. Once you've selected the option, simply click the left
mouse button on the area of the map that you want the upper left corner
of the buffer to start at. 

@{fg shine}Copy Block@{fg text} - This performs the same operation as the Cut Block option
except that the area is not replaced with the base block.

@{fg shine}Fill Block@{fg text} - This operation works in a similar way to the Cut Block
option, but rather than cutting the area out, it is filled with the 
current block.

@{fg shine}Show Copy Buffer@{fg text} - This does the same as Show Full Map, except the Copy
Buffer is shown rather than the Map.

@{fg shine}Save Copy Buffer@{fg text} - Allows you to save out the current copy buffer, the
format is the standard @{" GRIME format " link GRIME-MAPFILES}, so this file can be reloaded
as a map if you wish. @{" NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS VERSION " link GRIME-PDVERSION}

@{fg shine}Load Copy Buffer@{fg text} - Allows you to load a map into the copy buffer, the

@NODE GRIME-BLANKER "Screen Blanker"

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - Why's the screen gone black?@{fg text}@{uu}

A screen blanker stops the computer image from burning into your screen, 
by clearing it to black when no user input is detected for a certain 
amount of time. Because @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} is written in AMOS (Which isn't very OS
friendly) a normal screen blanker won't work while @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} is the 
frontmost screen, therefore I have incorporated a blanker into @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}.

@ENDNODE

@NODE GRIME-MAPFILES "Map Files"
@WORDWRAP OFF

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - Technical tings.@{fg text}@{uu}

Details of the map files.

The format of a @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} map file is as follows. The first twenty bytes are
used as a header to hold all the necessary information for @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} to 
function correctly. The data after this is the actual map data stored
in words.

The @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} header consists of the following information

Offset  Type      Information
---------------------------------
0       String    "GRIME"  - This is used to identify the file as a 
                             @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} file.
5       Byte      1        - The version number for the header. One 
                             identifies this as a map file.
6       Word      BLOCK_X  - This is the X dimension of the blocks used in
                             this map.
8       Word      BLOCK_Y  - This is the Y dimension of the blocks used in
                             this map.
10      Word      MAP_X    - This is the X dimension of the map.
12      Word      MAP_Y    - This is the Y dimension of the map.
14      Word      BASE_BLK - This is the base block (Normally zero) that
                             is used for clearing the map, and filling an
                             area after a cut operation.
16      Word      ATTRMASK - This is the mask used to obtain the attributes
                             from a file.
18      Word      future   - Reserved for future expandsion.
20      Words     MAP_DATA - The map data starts here.


To obtain the length of the MAP_DATA simply multiply MAP_X by MAP_Y.
To obtain the BLOCK_MASK simply do a logical NOT on the ATTRMASK.
The BLOCK_MASK is used to mask out the attributes from the block numbers in
the MAP_DATA to obtain the actual block number, the ATTRMASK is used to mask
out the block number and leaves you with just the attribute data.

The MAP_DATA is stored horizontally.
i.e. From the top left across to the top right, then the next line, etc.

The WORD RAW DATA file is the same as the @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} format, except that it 
DOES NOT contain the header. i.e. it simply contains MAP_DATA.
@{" NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS VERSION " link GRIME-PDVERSION}

The BYTES RAW DATA file is the same as the WORD file but it only contains
the lower 8-bits of each block. Hence, attibutes can NOT be saved with this
format, because @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} only allows the upper 8-bits (Maximum) to be used for
attributes, Sorry :(
@{" NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS VERSION " link GRIME-PDVERSION}

The AMOS BANK file contains the exact same data as the @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} format, except
is has an extra 20 bytes containing the AMOS bank header (See the AMOS
Professional manual for details of bank headers.)

@NODE GRIME-ATTRIBUTES "Attributes"
@WORDWRAP ON

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - The bits at the top...@{fg text}@{uu}

@{" NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS VERSION " link GRIME-PDVERSION}

@{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} handles attributes in two different ways.
When you alter a blocks attributes, you can choose to make the attribute
either LOCAL or GLOBAL.

LOCAL

When you select this option, the attributes affect the current block,
but only while it is current. For example if you select a block, then set
some attribute flags for it and choose the LOCAL option, the following 
happens. When you now paste this block onto the map, the block will retain
these attributes. But, if you select another block then re-select the
original block it will no longer have these attributes (Unless you select
the block using the pick block method, in which case the block will have 
the attributes of the block you picked). This is useful for blocks which
normaly do not have attibutes, but there may be an area of the map where
the block should have attributes (A hidden room, invisable bonus, etc.).


GLOBAL

This option affects the current block and the block when it's used in the
future. For example, selecting GLOBAL after setting some attributes, means
that whenever you select this block in the future (from the block screen)
it will have these attributes. This method would normally be used for
objects that, for example, always kills the player if he/she touched the
block.


While on the map screen @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} displays the current blocks attributes in the
information window at the top of the screen, using the following format.

-*--············

This layout shows the 16-bits that @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} uses to store the block
information.

The `·' represents the bits used for storing the BLOCK number.
The `-' represents the bits used for storing the ATTRIBUTES.
The `*' represents the bits in the ATTRIBUTES area that are set.

The total number of bits used for ATTRIBUTES is set using the ATTRIBUTES menu,
and the bits are set/cleared using this menu also.

While on the BLOCK screen @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} display the ATTRIBUTES information for the
block that is UNDER the cursor (i.e. Highlighted). This information is the
GLOBAL attributes value for the block.


The global attributes files that @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} saves contains the following
information.

Offset  Type     Information
-----------------------------
0       String   "GRIME"   - This is used to identify the file as a 
                             @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} file.
5       Byte     2         - The version number for the header. Two 
                             identifies this as a Global Attributes file.
6       Bytes    ATTRDATA  - The attribute flags for each block.

The length of the ATTRDATA is found by obtaining the length of the file 
minus 6 (The header length).

Each attribute flag is stored as a single byte, because @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} only allows
the upper 8 bits of the BLOCK WORD to be used as attribute flags.

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - PowerPacker Support@{fg text}@{uu}

PowerPacker can't pack the Config or Onwer files anyway :) and I don't think
many people will make use of the AMOS bank save routine (If you do and
want Powerpacker support for this routine, I might implement it)

@{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} can NOT load powerpacked IFF's either... 

@{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} can NOT save powerpacked files. So all files are saved in their RAW
format. I might implement a powerpacker save routine in the furture.

PowerPacker and the powerpacker.library are © Nico François.

@NODE GRIME-PALETTE "Palette Formats"

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - Colours??@{fg text}@{uu}

@{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} can save palettes for both AMOS and Assembler.
The files are saved as ASCII, and simply contains the hexidecimal values for
each colour in the palette.

For example an AMOS saved palette looks like this :-

	Palette $000,$FFF,$AAA,$555,$450,$FF0,$082,$00F


And an Assembler saved palette looks like this :-

	dc.w	$000,$FFF,$AAA,$555,$450,$FF0,$082,$00F

Very clever ain't it....

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - What's next?@{fg text}@{uu}

The commercial version @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} will be available soon and will feature full
attribute control, and no limit on block/map size, and of course there will
be no restricted features. Both myself and Squize have plently of ideas for
the next version of @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}, which I will work on if the response to this
version of @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} is good.

@NODE GRIME-HISTORY "History"

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - What have I missed?@{fg text}@{uu}

@WORDWRAP ON
Well this is the first version of @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} to be publicly released.
All previous versions of @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} have been simply past around to a couple of
friends. All previous versions were incomplete and quite buggy.

This version V1.2 is the PD release of the commercial version. It contains
all the features of the final version with some disabled/reduced functions.

Unfortunately, since comming back to university, I haven't had much time to
actually finish @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}. I hope this version is fairly bug free, and that this
document is both readable and understandable. The commercial version of
@{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} is almost complete and should be available soon (Hopefully before
the end of the year).

@NODE GRIME-PDVERSION "You don't get everything for nothing!"

@{u}@{fg fill}GRIME - Whats missing in the PD version?@{fg text}@{uu}

This is a PD version of @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text}.

A number of features have been disabled or reduced, these are as follows....

All Map save routines have been disabled, except for the @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} Format save
routine, which is limited to saving maps of 50 x 50 (or less). 
Configuration files cannot be saved or loaded (except the default config
file). All attribute functions have been disabled. Attributes within the
examples maps can be displayed though. The copy buffer cannot be saved,
but loading is possible. The undo function is limited to the last 10
operations, and you can not undo cut/pastes or fills.
I have also added many annoying requesters :)

           @{fg fill}-------------------------------------------------@{fg text}

The full commercial version of @{fg shine}GRIME@{fg text} will be available soon (hopefully!)
All the disabled features will be fully functioning, and possibly some new
features added (Depending on your responses!)
