SmartFields is a replacement for Intuition string gadgets.  It allows you to
incorporate into your Amiga C programs the powerful editing capabilities
often found in minicomputers.  See the Introduction for a detailed list of
features.

The SmartFields package used to be a commercial program written by me and
sold by Software Ingenuity.  Because Software Ingenuity no longer exists, and
because I hold the rights to all Software Ingenuity products, I decided to
release SmartFields as "freeware."  In all fairness to previous SmartFields
customers, I did not release this product until six months after the last
commercial package was sold.

As you may notice, I put quite alot of work into this package.  There are
seventy functions and over 250K of docs.  Unfortunately, there really isn't a
large enough market to support this type of product.  By releasing it as
freeware, hopefully more people will find use of it than if it had remained
commercial.

If you plan on using SmartFields in a program you develop, please read the
License Agreement.  Although I've released this as freeware, contributions
are definitely welcome.

In case you are wondering, this is not the SmartFields that I use for SID.
SID uses a very-stripped version of SmartFieldsII, the incredibly powerful
successor to this system.  SmartFieldsII has just about every feature that you
could think of, plus some that you may have not, such as dynamic fields
(fields with no fixed length--you can literally type forever!), vertical
fields (create a mini-text editor within your program), automatic formatting,
and more!  Whether that system will ever be released as a commercial product
or otherwise is questionable--I share the copyrights with another
corporation.  But if enough people show interest...
