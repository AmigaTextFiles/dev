1)  COMPLETE REGISTRATION CARD

    Does not apply.


2)  MAKE BACKUP COPY

    Before going any further, make a backup copy of your SmartFields
    diskette.  Consult your Amiga manual if you are unfamiliar with the
    procedure for copying diskettes.  Place your original SmartFields
    diskette in a safe place and use your backup copy for all procedures
    listed below.


3)  INSTALL CONSOLE INCLUDE FILES

    You need to install your SmartFields include files.  Include files are
    the files that you read during compilation, for example

        #include <intuition/intuition.h>

    Using the CLI dir command, display the include: directory:

        dir include:

    This directory should contain numerous subdirectories, including:

        devices (dir)
        exec (dir)
        graphics (dir)
        hardware (dir)
        intuition (dir)
        workbench (dir)
        ...

    The Amiga include files are stored in subdirectories as listed above.
    This is where you will install your SmartFields include files.

    SPECIAL NOTE: If you store your include files in ram: or on a sticky-RAM
    disk, you will need to find the include directory on your startup
    diskette and install the include files there as well.  Otherwise, any
    files you install only on your RAM disk will be lost when you shut off
    your Amiga.

    Change directories so you are now in the include directory containing all
    of the subdirectories as listed above:

        cd include:

    Now make a new directory called console:

        makedir console

    Copy the three SmartFields include files provided on your SmartFields
    diskette to the console directory you've just created:

        copy SmartFields:include/console/#? console/

    Now display the contents of the console directory:

        dir console

    If all went well, it should contain the following include files:

        console.h
        fields.h
        functions.h


4)  INSTALL TOOLKIT INCLUDE FILES

    WARNING!! If you are already using another Software Ingenuity product--
    the C Toolkit--you will have already installed a toolkit.h include file.
    If this is the case, do NOT execute this step (step 4)!

    Make a new directory called toolkit:

        makedir toolkit

    Copy the toolkit.h include file provided on your SmartFields diskette to
    the toolkit directory you've just created:

        copy SmartFields:include/toolkit/toolkit.h toolkit/

    Now display the contents of the toolkit directory:

        dir toolkit

    If all went well, it should contain the following file:

        toolkit.h


5)  COMPILE SMARTFIELDS FUNCTIONS

    A batch file has been provided that will compile all 70 SmartFields
    functions for you.  The file is named compile.lattice and is located in
    the Lattice directory on your SmartFields diskette.  Load the
    compile.lattice file into your favorite text editor.  You will notice a
    compilation line for each SmartFields function.  Every function is
    compiled using the lc command and the -v flag to inhibit stack checking.

    If you wish to compile the functions under different conditions, you need
    to add your own compiler flags (or remove the -v flag if desired).  As an
    example, let's say you want to remove the -v flag to enable stack
    checking.  Place the cursor at the top of the compile.lattice file and
    execute your text editor's search/replace function.  When it asks you
    which text you want to search for, type

        lc -v

    When it asks you which text you want to replace it with, type

        lc

    In essence, this will remove the -v flag from all compiler calls.

    If you made any changes, save the compile.lattice file back to disk.  To
    begin compilation, type at the CLI:

        execute SmartFields:lattice/compile.lattice

    This will compile all SmartFields functions, creating a ".o" object file
    for each ".c" source file.  The batch file will stop executing if any of
    the functions have a compiler error.  On the other hand, compiler
    warnings will be displayed, but the batch file will NOT stop executing.

    All 70 SmartFields functions will compile successfully using Lattice
    compiler versions 3.10 and 4.00 with the supplied compile.lattice batch
    file.


6)  CREATE SMARTFIELDS LIBRARY

    Now that you've compiled all of the SmartFields functions, you need to
    build them into a library to be linked with your C programs.  To do this,
    type at the CLI:

        execute SmartFields:lattice/library.lattice

    This will create a library called sf.lib in the Lattice directory of your
    SmartFields diskette.

    You now need to copy this library into the directory which contains the
    other link-time libraries such as lc.lib and lcm.lib.  At the CLI, type:

        copy SmartFields:lattice/sf.lib lib:

    Again, if lib: points to a directory in ram: or in a sticky-RAM disk, you
    will need to find the library directory on your startup diskette and
    install the SmartFields library there as well.  Any files you install
    only on your RAM disk will be lost when you shut off your Amiga.


7)  CONGRATULATIONS!

    You are now ready to incorporate the SmartFields system in your own
    programs!  An example program is supplied just to get you familiar with
    how you would go about using the SmartFields library.  If you would like
    a little practice, read on...


8)  EXAMPLE PROGRAM

    Change the current directory to the example program directory:

        cd SmartFields:programs/example

    The program labeled e.c is the example program discussed in the "Creating
    a SmartFields Program" section of the manual.  To compile the program and
    link it with the SmartFields library, type at the CLI:

        lc -L+lib:sf.lib e.c

    NOTE: If you added any flags to the compiler commands in the
    compile.lattice batch file, you may need to add them here as well!

    To run the example program, type at the CLI:

        e

    See page 10 in the manual for more information on this program.  To end
    the program, click on the window's close gadget.
