LIST OF LIBRARIES


console.lib
    This is the library of object modules that you create to link with your
    programs.  All of the compiled SmartFields functions are contained in
    this library.

exec.library
    This is the ROM-resident Amiga Executive library.  This library is
    automatically opened during the normal machine boot process, and
    therefore your program does not need to open it again.

graphics.library
    This is the ROM-resident Amiga Graphics library.  This library needs to
    be opened by your calling program before any of the SmartFields functions
    are called.  Failure to open this library will result in an illegal
    instruction error which will crash the machine.  Your calling program is
    also responsible for closing this library when the program is finished.

intuition.library
    This is the ROM-resident Amiga Intuition library.  This library needs to
    be opened by your calling program before any of the SmartFields functions
    are called.  This should not be a problem since your program must open a
    window anyway (which requires access to the intuition.library) before
    calling any of the SmartFields functions.  Failure to open the
    intuition.library will result in an illegal instruction error which will
    crash the machine.  Note that your program is also responsible for
    closing this library after use.  If you are unfamiliar with the opening
    and closing of libraries, see the program example.

standard C library
    This is a library of compiled standard C functions to be linked with your
    program.  This library should have been provided with your compiler.  If
    not, consult any C programming book for a listing of the function source.
