DISCLAIMER:
 Although I (the author) have thoroughly tested 'The Guru' and have done 
 everything possible to make the program reliable, you use it at your own
 risk! I am not responsible for any damage caused by using this program,
 either direct or indirect. If this program spontaneously crashes your
 computer, melts your car, blows your nose, or explodes your grandma :-),
 I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE !!!

DISTRIBUTION:
 'The Guru' may be included in PD. libraries, on coverdisks, on CD's etc.
 The files may be archived as long as they are unaltered after dearchieving.
 The only restriction I make is that it may NOT BE SOLD for profit,
 and that you keep all the files together. You should have the following
 files:

              DOS_Err.data                9051 
              Guru2.3                    10784 
              Guru2.3c                   38572 
              GURU_Err.data              19494 
              SimErr                       972
              Docs                    (drawer)

 If your set is not complete, or the filesizes are different you should
 not use the programs. (hacked versions, viruses etc.) 

 You'll probably have noticed that there are two versions of 'The Guru'.
 The only difference is that the normal 2.3 version loads its data from
 disk, therefore the files DOS_Err.data and GURU_Err.data must be in the
 same directory as Guru2.3. 
 The 2.3c version is an all-in-one version, the data files are hidden 
 safe away inside the program. You can put this anywhere you want on your
 disk or hard drive.

TUTORIAL:
 Every amiga owner has seen a guru message or software error as they are
 called in kickstart 2.0 and above  at least once in his/her life. That 
 nasty red flashing box has a purpose; the two numbers in the box can tell
 you why your amiga crashed. The numbers take the following form:
 +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |     Software failure.        Press left mouse button to continue.    |
 |                                                                      |
 |                 Error: 12345678   Task: 12345678                     |
 +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

 You see two numbers here, one behind error and one behind task.
 The one behind task is the address in memory where the crash occurred.
 You can use a monitor and/or dissassembler on that address to see the
 instruction(s) that caused the error. The number behind error is the
 real important one, it tells you precisely what error occurred. (If you
 are a programmer it tells you what stupid error you've made !) 
 Unfortunately a number alone doesn't mean much... but this is where
 'The Guru' comes in. 'The Guru' will decode the message for you into
 a more understandable form. You only have to follow three easy-to-understand
 steps:
        1- When the software error appears press the left mouse button
           Your computer will reboot.
        2- Use the workbench or the shell to start the 'The Guru' program.
        3- Click the @{"LAST" system "display buttons.iff"} button, then the @{"GURU" system "display buttons.iff"} button and a miracle 
           happens (well, not quite, but at least you know what has gone
           wrong...)

 To test 'The Guru' you can run the program SimErr, which is included in this
 distribution. Just run SimErr, then start at step 2 above.
 If everything went right you should see something like this in the 'The Guru'
 window:

          GURU NUMBER:
            82011234: Deadend Alert

          DESCRIPTION (graphics):
            AN_GfxNoLCM: Emergency memory not
            available

          RECOVERY SUGGESTION:
            Clipping graphics in your own program
            might help ?!

 All this means: Your computer crashed because the graphics.library didn't
 have enough memory (mostly for graphics clipping) available.
 Easy eh...

 But that's not all! You can also get help with DOS-errors like
  
  Couldn't run program x: error 121

 Just use the @{"+" system "display buttons.iff"} and @{"-" system "display buttons.iff"} buttons located above and below the three-digit number
 in the 'The Guru' window to set the number to 121. Then click the DOS
 button.

 You can set the guru number in a similar manner; use the @{"+" system "display buttons.iff"} and @{"-" system "display buttons.iff"} buttons 
 above and below the eight digit number to set it. Then click the GURU
 button.

 The @{"ABOUT" system "display buttons.iff"} button gives information about the program, the @{"QUIT" system "display buttons.iff"} button 
 quits, and the @{"DEFAULT" system "display buttons.iff"} button resets the program. (not your computer)

CUSTOMISING:

 'The Guru' can be a little bit customized by two tooltypes:

  IMMEDIATE   - Guess...
  AUTOTOFRONT - The window pops to front as soon as it's activated.
   (can be useful if the window is obscured by some other windows)
