If you have any ideas or suggestions about features that you would like
to see implemented in version 3.0 then PLEASE let ME KNOW ABOUT THEM!!

Already planned for version 3 are:
  - Faster Guru searching (I don't know if I'll manage that !)
  - Printer support
  - A faster way to set the dos/guru errornumber displays
     (but I'm not sure how yet...)
  - Anything YOU suggest...

  - I would also like to Localize the program (Wb 2.1 and above) but I
     need some help with the Locale.library... (Anybody ?)

  - If you know of any Guru or DOS error numbers that are not implemented
     in The Guru yet, please let me know.
