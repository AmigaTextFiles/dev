	Curses library source for the Amiga

This is the Read_Me file provided with the source code for Amiga
Curses.  See the documentation provided with the library for more
information on how to use curses.

This source is the result of many requests, mainly from Aztec users
for source code to allow them to use curses.  Please DO NOT distribute
altered copies of this code, report any changes you wish made back to
me and they will be added to future releases.

Unedited copies of source may be freely distributed.

I have not provided a makefile for any compiler other than lattice and
GNU C at the moment. If someone wants to send me a good makefile for
the compiler they use I will include it in future releases.

Any problems compiling the library on your favorite compiler should be
reported back to me and I'll attempt to help you out. Also any bugs
should be signaled back in some way so that I can fix them in the next
release.
