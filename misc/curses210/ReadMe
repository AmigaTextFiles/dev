Distribution conditions
-----------------------

This curses package for the Amiga is freely distributable as long as
the supplied archive remains intact and the source code is unchanged.

Feel free to sell any programs that you have written that require
curses for as much as you can get for them.

I ask for no royalties or payment of any kind for the sale of programs
using this library.

All I ask is that a mention is made to the fact that your program used
this library which is available free of charge with source.

No code may be distributed with altered copies of this library linked
in.

Source
------

I am including the source so that users other than SAS and GNU may
benefit from this package.

Please do not breach the above distribution conditions or source will
no longer be distributed freely.

The source code is copyright S.J.Raybould 1991/92/93 and all rights
are reserved.

Aims
----

This package is mainly aimed at people who wish to port screen based
UNIX applications to the Amiga or people who wish to develop screen
based applications for UNIX on their Amiga.


I have received a few email letters about some people not having
access to any curses documentation while using earlier versions of my
library. I had anticipated people have UNIX curses manuals and stuff.
I have therefore extended the documentation file to be more useful. It
now includes prototypes and a description of what the functions do.

I am still fairly sure that I have missed some out so I'll attempt to
track those down and get them documented soon (I hate writing docs!).

This version includes a hyertext file for use with the Commodore
"AmigaGuide" program. Also a postscript manual is included.


Use
---

To use this stuff, include curses.h at the top of your code instead of
stdio.h (curses.h will include stdio.h). Compile as normal and when
linking, link in the library 'curses.lib'. 'curses.h' should be
installed in the same directory as 'stdio.h' (INCLUDE:) with SAS
V6.20. 'curses.lib' could be put in the same directory as 'sc.lib' or
'c.lib' (LIB:) with SAS V6.20

You can put it elsewhere but you will have to explicitly specify the
path when accessing it.

I personally have all libraries that are not part of the official
release of a compiler in LLIB: (local lib). This way I can update the
compiler without having to re-install the local libraries. Just a
suggestion, works for me.

Please Note
-----------

The curses library should be linked in before all other libraries on
the link line.

E.G.  slink lib:c.o foo.o TO foo LIB llib:curses.lib+lib:sc.lib+lib:amiga.lib


DICE users
----------

Matthew Rex has supplied the file "files.curseslib" for use with DICE.
He recommends the following command to create the library from the
object files.

    libmake files.curseslib -o LIB: -l curses.lib

DICE users should remember to adhere to naming conventions for
different data models if they shoose to make them.


Credits
-------

I feel I must thank certain people for their help in the improvement
of this package from which we all stand to gain. Without their
suggestions, the development of this package would have been
significantly slower, Thanks.

    Michael Fischer     - For finding many bugs in the first alpha of curses and
                          continued bug finding and suggestions. Thanks Mike!

    Phil Kernick        - For his excellent suggestions for improvements.

    Kai Vorma           - For suggestions and bug reports.

    jpb@globule.CAM.ORG - For encouraging me to add the ANSI/serial support
                          and then spotting the errors. It was well worth it.

    Matthew Rex         - For porting the code to work with DICE,
                          thanks Matt !


    Any bugs, suggestions,  e.t.c. email to 'sie@fulcrum.co.uk'
