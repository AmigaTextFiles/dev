                     AMIGA CURSES PACKAGE
                     ====================


Author: Simon J Raybould.    sie@fulcrum.co.uk


Updates from V1.00 to V1.10
===========================

Bugs Fixed
----------

    1. calling wrefresh() and other such functions with an uninitialised
       pointer caused the machine to hang up.
    
    2. Fixed bugs in box() routine, including cursor position after
       drawing a box.

    3. Fixed all of the mvwxxxx() routines such as mvwaddch(), mvwaddstr, 
       e.t.c. These were previously doing the move part of the instruction 
       in stdscr instead of the specified window.


Changes Made
------------

    1. Now distributed with two libraries, one with full 32 bit addressing
       for large programs, and one without for smaller code.

    2. Changed the advised line to blink in the examples. Now includes
       curses.lib before the other libraries.

    3. Added more examples.

    4. Corrected newwin/subwin control/refreshing to be more like UNIX.

    5. Added nocrmode().

    6. Altered the header file to fix the mvwxxxx() bugs mentioned above.

    7. Added mvwin().

    8. Added full keyboard support including Function keys and Cursor keys.

    9. Made keypad() switch the ANSI mapping off when set to TRUE.


Updates from V1.10 to V1.20
===========================

Bugs Fixed
----------

    1. Reference from address 0 in endwin() removed.

    2. Fixed curscr to make it a copy of the physical screen.
       So wrefresh(curscr) will tidy up the screen to what it was last time
       a refresh was done.

Changes Made
------------

    1. Changed data structure for line storage to reduce the overhead in
       finding a particular line.

    2. Many speed improvements.

    3. Added doupdate() & wnoutrefresh().

    4. Made LINES & COLS extern ints and made them initialise to the size
       of the active screen when curses is invoked. This is unless the
       environment variables LINES and COLS exist, in which case, they will
       be used.

    5. Changed the format of the libraries in an attempt to make them
       compatible with more linkers by making them standard amiga format.
    
    6. Added many more functions, including flushinp(), resetterm() e.t.c.


Updates from V1.20 to V1.21
===========================

Bugs Fixed
----------

    1. Fixed the range on box() to allow SPACE as a character.
       This allows you to draw a box of inverse spaces.

Changes Made
------------

    1. Added mvcur() to allow the cursor to be moved straight away
       without calling refresh().


Updates from V1.21 to V1.22
===========================

Bugs Fixed
----------

    1. If active screen is interlaced then the curses screen is also interlaced
       to allow 64 lines on a PAL system.

    2. When there was a '\n' in a print that had inverse video set, a line of
       inverse spaces was added up to the end of line. This was incompatible
       with UNIX curses and has now been fixed.


Updates from V1.22 to V1.23
===========================

Bugs Fixed
----------

    1. init_color() was not working due to an overflow.

    2. KEY_DC and KEY_BACKSPACE had the wrong defines in "curses.h".

    3. nonl() was not turning off carriage return to linefeed mapping.

    4. Calls to nonl(), nl(), cbreak(), e.t.c had to appear after the
       call to initscr(). This is not the case with UNIX curses, so this
       is no longer necessary with Amiga curses. It is common for these
       initialisations to appear at the top of the code, before the call
       to initscr().

Features Added
--------------

    1. Made it possible to interrupt a curses application by hitting ^C
       in the window it was invoked from. It will call endwin() to tidy
       up before exiting.


Updates from V1.23 to V2.00
===========================

Bugs Fixed
----------

    1. Sometimes crashed in BreakHandler when interrupted by a ^C.

    2. Now works with any font to support KS/WB 2.04.

    3. Fixed scroll().

Changes
-------

    1. Split source into separate modules to make resultant binaries smaller
       when linked with the library.

    2. Only eight colours are available in UNIX curses, so I have reduced
       the number in Amiga curses to the eight as well. So colour
       applications should work correctly on Amigas and UNIX without
       alteration.

    3. Now defaults to 1 bit plane until start_color() is called, when DEPTH
       is set to 3 to give 8 colours. This should make mono applications go
       faster than with previous versions of curses.

    4. Added ANSI support so that curses may be run over the serial line
       or over a modem.


Updates from V2.00 to V2.10
===========================

    1. Fixed bug that causes attributes to be trashed when scroll was
       called.

    2. Environment variables LINES and COLS were not working properly.

    3. Fixed bug in refresh which caused background windows to have lines
       erased by smaller windows over the top of them.

    4. Fixed bug that caused WB2 fonts to not work correctly.

    5. Added dummy function for gettmode().

    6. Added longname().

    7. Added unctrl().

    8. Added overlay() & overwrite().

    9. Added setterm().

   10. Added termcap/terminfo low level routines.
