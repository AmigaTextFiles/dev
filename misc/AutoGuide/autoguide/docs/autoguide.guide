@node Intro "Introduction"

    INTRODUCTION

    AutoGuide is a new and smart way to write your AmigaGuide docs and, in the
    mean time, keep your sources files updated with the latest comments.

    The idea behind this program is very simple: while you are writing or 
    modifiying a program of yours, you can keep the docs updated by simply
    inserting the whole docs _inside_ the source code.

    AutoGuide will scan your source code, searching for @node/@endnode sections
    which will rappresent the AmigaGuide nodes. You can include your comments (docs)
    inside /* */ or any way that is used by your own language to comment your
    program. 

    See the example provided for better understanding.

@node usage "Usage"

    USAGE

    AutoGuide is a small (2k) shell program. You can pass parameters to it, from
    the shell. Standard template is:

    INFILE/A,OUTFILE/A,VERSION/K,VERBOSE/S

    INFILE  - You MUST provide this: it is your source code to scan

    OUTFILE - you MUST provide this too: it is the name of destination guide that will  
              be created.

    VERSION - By providing this keyword, you can pass to AutoGuide a version string
              that will be automagically inserted inside the program.

    VERBOSE - This is a switch. Write this keyword to see some comments during 
              AutoGuide work.


    Examples:

    AutoGuide foo.e ram:test.guide  
    (opens the "foo.e" source file and creates the test.guide in Ram Disk)

    AutoGuide foo.e ram:test.guide VERSION="Foo Docs V2.0 - By Me"
    (same as above, inserting a comment line also)

    AutoGuide foo.e ram:test.guide VERBOSE
    (some comments during conversion)

@node install "Installation"

    INSTALLATION

    Hey, AutoGuide is a 2k program. You can place it wherever you want. 
    Better places are C: dir and its assings.
