@{b}What the heck is this?@{ub}

This thing is all about fidonet.lib, a linker library that provides you
with easy means for writing Fidonet message packets (Type 2, FSC-0039).
This is the first version, and only has functions for writing packets.

@{b}How do I use it?@{ub}

Call MakePkt(). Then call MakeMsg(), write the message body (to, from,
subject and text) into the packet file, and repeat this as many times
as you want, once for each message. Then, call ClosePkt() to finish
the packet.

@{b}What?@{ub}

Take a look at the example source code fidonet.c that accompanies
the library. It should be everything you need to understand the use.

@{b}Who did it?@{ub}

This distribution is freeware. You may use the library in your own PD
or commercial programs. The author of the library and the documentation
is @{b}Sami Klemola@{ub} (shadow@spider.compart.fi). ©1996 SH-Ware. All Rights
Reserved.

    @{" Helpful code " link code}

Wait! There is more. I have included a tool called ViewPkt in the
distribution. You can use it to view and test the packets created.
ViewPkt is located in the ViewPkt subdirectory.

@node code "Helpful code"
The library leaves writing the message up to you. You may find this
additional function helpful and may want to use it.

void WriteMsg(u_char *from, u_char *to, u_char *subject, u_char *text) {
    MakeMsg(pkt,NULL,0);
    Write(pkt,to,strlen(to)+1);
    Write(pkt,from,strlen(from)+1);
    Write(pkt,subject,strlen(subject)+1);
    Write(pkt,text,strlen(text)+1);
};
