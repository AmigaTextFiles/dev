ViewPkt 2.00
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a little program that shows you information about a FidoNet standard
mail packet. Just enter "ViewPkt <pktname>", and you'll see information on
the packet such as time and date of its creation, the origin address, the
destination address and some technical information such as the bundler
product code that created the packet, and its capability word.

This is v2.00, which has two options new to v1.00: MSG and TXT. Specifying
the MSG option will cause the packet to be scanned from top to bottom, and
all message headers displayed. Specifying the TXT option in addition will
cause the message text to be displayed as well. In other words, you can
dump an entire packet using this program, and redirection to a file also
works.

This program is intended as a tool for debugging or just exploring. The
latter is why this program was written. I started exploring the FidoNet
technology, and while studying the FTN documents, wrote code, and this
is what I got. This has been fun for me, and I hope it's fun for you too!
