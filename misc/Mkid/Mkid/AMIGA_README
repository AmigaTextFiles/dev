	I got this back in 1987, and have been using it since then.  It
is freely redistributable (see the original writer's copyright message).
My modifications and the 2 routines I added are public domain.  It also
uses Chuck McManis's cooked IO routines.

	To compile under amigados, you must use -Dfseek=unixfseek.  This
is because the program assumes fseek will extend the file, which is not
normally true under amigados.

	It needs an amigados makefile (badly).  Don't forget to include
amiga.c, amiga_getenv.c, and raw.o.

	It could use some of the 2.0 routines (like the pattern-matching
in place of unix RE's, and GetVar() in amiga_getenv.c).  Under 2.0 you
can use one executable and hardlink the others (it keys off the name it
was run under).

	It's pretty stable.  Unix-pathing has been replaced with amiga-
pathing (., .., etc).  The amiga-specific changes to the main code are
ifdef AMIGA.
