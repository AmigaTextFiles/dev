<h1>
5   Statements
</h1>

<p>
There is naturally very little change in this classical area of the
language.  The only additional statement is the requeue statement and
that is addressed in Chapter 9.  There are also additional forms of the
delay and select statements and these are also discussed in Chapter 9.
The mechanism of assignment including user-defined assignment is closely
associated with controlled types and these are discussed in 7.4.  The
return statement is now moved to Chapter 6 where it properly belongs.
