SHADOW V4.6 is provided as is, plus all that legal mumbo jumbo.

SHADOW is (C) 1992 by David C. Navas

Shadow.library is NOT in the public domain, but it is freely distributable
but only for those programs and environments which are freely distributable.

All other Rights are Reserved by the author.

If you would like to use this library in a commercial product, please
contact the author at:

   David C. Navas [SHADOW]
   950 Mt. View Dr.  #6
   Lafayette, CA 94549

and we will try to bargain for a reasonable fee.  :)


However, in order to receive the includes and .lib/.fd files, you will
need to pay a small shareware fee, say $15-$20 (depending upon how far
you live from California -- I need to cover shipping charges....).
The exceptions to this are people who have contacted me about Jazzbench
and payed money for it, or people who have Beta Tested this library.

Feel free also to call me at (510) 283-6098, or to e-mail me at
navas@cory.berkeley.edu if you are interested and want more information.

SHADOW requires 2.0!

Thank you for your interest!  I hope you find using this package to be as
much fun as I had designing it.
