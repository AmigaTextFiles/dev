<h3><a name="invis.link">Link doesn't move with its Box</a></h3>
<!-- -->
24 November 1997 We had a funny one.  A box had a two links attached to it 
on the diagram, one to its left and another to its right.  But when we 
moved the box around with the mouse, only the left link seemed attached to 
it.  It appeared as though the box had only its left link.  Yet the right 
hand link would snap to its new position once we moved the box to its new 
place and let the mouse button go.  And when we clicked on the link its 
details panel came up, showing it to be an inference relationship from the 
attribute expressed by the box we had moved.
<p>
Reason:  We had two relationships from the box to its consequent, not just 
one.  As we could see when we brought up the attribute details panel of the 
box: it had two consequents, both the same.  What was happening was that 
the two links each had a (complement-mode) sketchpiece when being moved 
around, which meant that the result was to draw the moving line in the 
original colours - hence invisible.
<p>
Solution:  Remove one of the relationships via the relationship details 
panel.  Or, if we need both links, bend one out of the way of the other.

<h4><a name="invis.box.outline">Box outline is invisible</a></h4>
<!-- -->
24 November 1997  Some boxes in an old KB had text but, seemingly, no box. 
The box outline was invisible.  When we moved the box there seemed to be a 
glimmer where it moved, but the box was invisible.
<p>
Reason:  The box pen number had exactly the same colour as the background.
<p>
Another possible reason:  The box pen number is 0, that is the background 
pen.
<p>
Solution:  Alter box pen number via attribute details panel, or alter the 
colour for this pen number via the Easel panel.

      <h4><a name="">
Attribute Action Panel doesn't show Infer Button
      </a></h4><!-- -->

6 February 1999  I was stumped!  I had an attribute attached to a Form 
(attribute 1Bayesian in the form knowledge base in TestKBs), but when I 
clicked on it with left mouse button, its attribute action panel showed 
only a Reset Button and no Infer Button.  (It showed Data, Delete, AddGoal 
and Done buttons OK.)
      <p>
Reason:  The attribute had become Overridden.  When I brought up its 
Attribute Details Panel, the Override gadget was checked.  (Note that the 
CanOverride gadget was blank - this was because it had probably become 
overridden via an Override Form.)
      <p>
Remedy:
      <ol>
<li> Bring up Attribute Details Panel, check the CanOverride gadget, and 
hit OK.
<li> Bring up its Attribute Action Panel.  Now there should be an Override 
Button.
<li> Hit the Override Button on Action Panel.  You should be asked a 
Question for the attribute, and on the Question Panel there should be an 
Unset Button.
<li> Hit the Unset Button.
<li> Now try the Attribute Action Panel, and the Infer Button should be 
present.
<li> Might also have an Override Button below it; this can be removed on 
the Attribute Details Panel by clearing the CanOverride gadget.
      </ul>
