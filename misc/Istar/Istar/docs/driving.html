<h1>DRIVING ISTAR</h1>
<!-- -->
      <p>
This is updated for Version 1.08, December 1997.

<h2><a name="sys.needs">WHAT DO I NEED TO START IT?</a></h2>
<!-- -->
      <p>
Normally you don't need to bother about this lot as they are set up during 
installation and Amiga startup.  But if something goes wrong then this list 
might help.
<p>
<ul>

<li>  assign <code>KBTools:</code> to some directory for best effect, since 
it is in subdirectories of this that Istar seeks knowledge bases and places 
dumps etc.
<li>  assign <code>IstarSys:</code> to some directory for prefs files (and, 
in future, other things)
<li>  <code>iff.library</code> (can run without it)
<li>  <code>asl.library</code> is needed for saving etc. (supplied with 
Amiga 1200)
<li>  Fonts needed depends now on <code>IstarSys:IstarPrefs</code> but the 
defaults are:
<ul>
      <li>  Courier 11
      <li>  Garnet 16
</ul>
</ul>
(all supplied with standard 1200).

<h2><a name="install">INSTALLING ISTAR</a></h2>
<!-- -->
Simply double click on the <code>Istall Istar</code> icon and decide in 
which drawer you are going to install it.
      <p>
It doesn't do anything clever; it merely copies across the Istar program 
and some relevant files and directories, and updates your <code>s:user-
startup</code> with commands to assign <code>IstarSys:</code> and 
<code>KBTools:</code>.

<h2><a name="starting">HOW DO I START IT?</a></h2>
<!-- -->
      <p>
This describes the normal start of Istar, from WorkBench.
      <p>
(If you are operating with <b>low memory</b>, such as a base A1200, then 
refer to the section below on '<a href="#low.mem">Starting with Low 
Memory</a>'.  If you <b>start from CLI</b>, a few options are available in 
Version 1.04 onwards; see <a href="#cli">later</a>.)
      <p>
Note:  <b>Bold</b> is often used for concepts and jargon terms used in 
Istar when they are first used.  <i>Italics</i> is often used for some 
action you should take.  <a href="#oops"><b>'Oops'</b></a> is used to tell 
you what to do if things don't seem to be going as expected.
      <p>
1.  Double click on the Istar icon.
      <p>
2.  You will be presented with a grey <b>Control Screen</b> part way up the 
view.  Initially this has 'Istar' on its title bar but that is soon 
obscured by a horizontal strip and, at the left, the Initial <b>Control 
Panel</b>.
      <p>
3.  Click the 'New' button, and two things will happen.  First another 
screen, a large blank white one appears.  This is the <b>Easel</b> on which 
you draw your KB (knowledge base).  And, on the Control Screen, another 
panel appears with columns of buttons and two list gadgets.  (<i>If you are 
operating with <a href="#low.mem">limited memory</a></i>, the standard 
Easel size (30 by 24 inches) might be too large, and you will have to alter 
the Prefs before clicking the New button.)
      <p>
Here are a few instructions to get you started ...
      <p>
<a NAME="draw.box">
4.</a>  Move the mouse pointer up over the large white <b>Easel</b> then 
<i>press left mouse button</i> (<b>LMB</b>) and keep it down.  A box 
appears that moves with the mouse.  Move the mouse around.  Then <i>release 
LMB</i>.  (<b>Oops</b>:  No box appears.  Have you clicked rather than 
press, drag, release?  Do not click it; clicking does something else.)
      <p>
5.  Draw another box, in the same way, to the right of first one.
      <p>
<a NAME="draw.link">
6.</a>  Move the mouse pointer tip over the right hand <b>edge</b> of the 
left-hand box, and <i>press LMB while over the edge</i>.  You will see a 
short line appear from your mouse pointer to a point one quarter the way 
into the box.  This line follows the mouse as you move it.  <i>Move mouse 
around</i> until line is over the other (right-most) box and <i>release 
LMB</i>.  A line should appear from one box to the other.  (The left-hand 
box is called the <b>antecedent</b> of the right, and the right is the 
<b>consequent</b> of the left.)
      (<b>Oops</b>:  No line appears, but the box moves?  You had the mouse
pointer too far into the box, not exactly over the right-hand edge; you 
have about one sixteenth of an inch leeway.  <b>Oops</b>:  A new box 
appears?  You had the mouse pointer too far outside the box, not exactly 
over the right-hand edge.  In either case <i>hit Escape key</i>; see 7 
below.  <b>Oops</b>:  When I release the LMB no link appears between the 
boxes?  Probably because you have released the LMB too soon; when you 
release, it is not the mouse tip that should be in the box so much as the 
end of the moving-line; sometimes this end is not quite at the mouse tip, 
for reasons that are discussed elsewhere.)
      <p>
6a.  (If you wish, you can draw the line in the reverse direction: from the 
left-hand edge of the right-most box leftwards to the left-most box.)
      <p>
<a NAME="bends">
6b.  If you want to <b>insert a bend</b></a> in your line while drawing it, 
<i>hit Space bar</i> when moving-end of line is where you want the bend.
      <p>
      <p>
<a NAME="infce.rel">
<a NAME="infce.att">
6c.  Note:  The boxes and links you have drawn are not just pieces of 
graphics; they have specific meaning.  Behind the user interface that you 
see, in the knowledge base itself, for each box an <a 
href="rfman.html#items">item</a> and <a 
href="rfman.html#attributes">attribute</a> have been created and for each 
link an <a href="rfman.html#infce">inference</a> relationship has been 
created.  You will learn more of both as you progress through this tutorial 
and into the <a href="using.html">Using Istar for Inference</a> tutorial.
</a></a>
      <p>
7.  (To escape from any operation you have started but don't want, hit the 
Escape key.  Then release the mouse button.)
      <p>
That's the basic mechanism, and the whole knowledge base can be drawn like 
that.  Not too bad, is it?
      <p>

<h2><a name="more">GOING FURTHER</a></h2>
<!-- -->

8.  Various <b>modifications of the diagram</b> are possible:
      <p>
<ul>
      a)  <i>Move a box</i> by pressing LMB over the centre of the box.
      Dotted skeleton of the box and all its connecting links appears.
      Move mouse and this lot follows.  Release in new position.  (Note
      that boxes can overlap, though it is usually not wise to do so;
      overlapping is usually reserved to collections of boxes that are
      closely related semantically.)  (<b>Oops</b>:  No dotted skeleton
      appears.  If a new line appears then you have pressed the LMB while
      over a right- or left-hand edge of the box, not near its middle.  Hit
      Escape and try again.)
      <p>
      b)  <i>Bend an existing drawn link</i> by pressing LMB over a link.
      Dotted bent line follows mouse to new position; release.  Pressing
      LMB over existing bend will just move the bend to new position.
      (<b>Oops</b>:  line doesn't bend, but a box appears instead?  You
      were not near enough to the line when you pressed LMB.  Hit Escape
      and try again.)
      <p>
      c)  (Other modifications are possible e.g. to redirect a link to
      another box, or to delete a box, delete a link, delete a bend from a
      link:  see below.)
</ul>
      <p>
<a NAME="adp"><a NAME="name.it">
9a.  <b>Entering detail, e.g. Name and Meaning</b></a></a>.  <i>Click</i> 
the <i>Right</i> Mouse Button (RMB) over centre of box.  (<b>Oops</b>:  If 
you get a dotted box outline as in 8(a) then you haven't clicked fast 
enough; hit escape key, release MB and try again.  You'll soon get the hang 
of it.)  Up comes the Control Screen, showing an <b>Attribute Detail 
panel</b> with around fifty gadgets.  Don't panic: you need only the top 
two: <b>Label and Meaning</b>; ignore the others for now.  (<b>Oops</b>: 
If a small panel comes up with half a dozen buttons - the Action panel - 
then you have clicked the wrong MB; as we shall see below, this comes up 
when you click the LMB rather than the RMB.  To get to the Attribute 
Details Panel, either hit the 'Data..' button, which will take you there, 
or hit the 'Done' button with the LMB to send it away and try again.)
      <p>
9b.  Along top of panel are two <i>string gadgets</i> which allow you to 
enter a <b>name</b> for the box and a longer <b>meaning</b> if you wish. 
For now, <i>type something in Label string, press Return and carry on 
typing in Meaning string</i> - type anything that you like.  Then <i>click 
the OK</i> button.  The Control Screen returns and your box should display 
the new name.  (<b>Oops</b>:  If you try to type and nothing enters either 
string then click LMB over the string you wish to type in to activate the 
string gadget.)
      <p>
9c.  (There are two OK buttons on the Attribute Details Panel: a small one 
in the top row for your convenience when merely entering label and meaning, 
and the main one about two-thirds of the way down.  There is also a third, 
OK-Act, which we will use later.)
      <p>
<a NAME="show.meaning">
10.  <b>Showing Meaning</b></a>.  On the Easel, <i>move</i> the mouse over 
the box (<i>do not press</i> any mouse button).  The <b>Meaning text</b> 
should appear in the horizontal window in the top of the Control Screen. 
Move mouse away, and it disappears.  In this way, even when the box label 
text is too small to read you can easily see what a box means.
      <p>
<a NAME="ensure.active">
10a.</a>  (<b>Oops</b>:  Nothing happens?  Probably the Easel has not been 
reactivated after hitting the OK button.  Only one panel or easel is active 
at any time.  If you see the border of a panel is pink rather than grey 
then that panel is active, rather than the Easel.  You can <b>activate the 
Easel</b> in several ways.  One is to hit the 'See Easel' button on the 
control panel (not available on earliest versions of Istar).  Another is to 
move over the centre of a box on the Easel, press LMB in an attempt to move 
it - see 8a above - and release or hit Escape key.  Anything using LMB over 
Easel will activate it (but using the RMB will not).)
      <p>
11.  <b>More antecedents</b>.  <i>Draw another couple of boxes</i> (see 4 
above) near the left-hand box (above or below it) and <i>link these</i> to 
the right-hand box as in 6 above.  The right-most box now has three or more 
antecedents.  Best also to name them with different names as in 8 above.
      <p>
<a NAME="running">
12.  <b>Running the inference net</b></a>.  Now <i>click with the Left 
Mouse Button</i> over the centre of the right-hand box.  Up comes a small 
panel at the top of the Control Screen containing a few buttons, the 
<b>Attribute Action panel</b>.  The two buttons on the left are: Reset and 
Infer, which allow you to run the KB.  <i>Hit Reset, then hit Infer</i>. 
Up comes a <b>User Question panel</b>, with text at the top showing the 
meaning or label of one of the antecedent attributes, a large central 
<b>Value gadget</b>, a slider, and an large OK gadget to right, with a few 
others.  Enter a Value by sliding the slider over towards the the right 
using the LMB and hit OK with LMB.  Then a similar panel should appear for 
the next attribute.  And the next.  If you have three antecedent (left-
hand) boxes feeding into the consequent (right-hand) one you should get 
three such User Question panels.  (<b>Oops</b>:  No panels come up.  Have 
you hit Reset then Infer?  <b>Oops</b>:  Only one Question panel comes up. 
Maybe you have the Action panel for one of the antecedent attributes?  A 
glance at its title will give the name/label of the attribute for which it 
is the Action panel.)
      <p>
12a.  (The meaning of the values given by the sliders will become clear 
when you start the chapter <a href="using.html">Using Istar</a>.)
      <p>
<a NAME="adp.result">
13.  <b>Seeing the result</b></a>.  When the question sequence has 
finished, the Attribute Action panel is still there.  Hit the <i>Data 
button</i>, and you are taken to the Attribute Details panel.  The result 
should be shown in the <b>slider gadget on the second row in the middle</b> 
- and it should show somewhere over to its right end if you slid all the 
antecedent sliders over to the right.
      <p>
14.  Control Screen.  You can <b>drag the Control Screen</b> up and down 
using the thin white line along its top, just above the strip where the 
meaning texts appear.  Use the tip of the mouse pointer and LMB to do this. 
Half way up is not a very convenient place, so you can <b>park it</b> by 
dragging the screen down to reveal more of the Easel and hitting the second 
gadget from the left on the Control Screen strip.  This is the parking 
button.  From then on this is where the Control Screen returns to. 
Whenever you want to <b>access the Control Screen</b>, hit the Gadget 
showing two arrows at left edge of the top strip of the Control Screen.  Up 
it comes.  Hit it again, and it parks back down the bottom.

<h2><a name="more.still">GOING FURTHER STILL - DIFFERENT TYPES</a></h2>
<!-- -->

15.  <b>Different box types</b>.  Bring up the control screen.  Look at the 
KB panel.  It has two listview gadgets.  The upper of these (left-hand one, 
pre version 1.08) is a list of item or attribute types (Free Bayesian, Free 
Integer, etc.) for which boxes will be drawn.  <i>Select 'Free Integer'</i> 
by hitting it with the LMB.  Send Control Screen away (hit the left-most 
two-arrows button) to reveal the Easel.
      <p>
<a NAME="scrolling">16.  <b>Scrollable Easel</b></a>.  <i>Ensure</i> the 
Easel is active (<a href="#ensure.active">step 10a</a>).  Now <i>move the 
mouse</i> over to the right hand side and keep moving.  <b>The Easel 
scrolls smoothly to the left</b> - a tribute to the Amiga's hardware-
assisted scrolling.  This allows you to traverse a large knowledge base - 
and, since scrolling happens even during drawing, allows you to draw very 
long links.  But, for now, we use it to <b>gain empty space for a new 
inference net</b>.
      <p>
17a.  <i>Draw a new box</i> on the Easel in some empty space (= <a 
href="#draw.box">step 4</a>) - it should say 'Integer' in it and be a 
different colour from the Bayesian boxes you had before.  Give it a 
name/label of 'Result' (= <a href="#name.it">step 9</a>).
      <p>
17b.  Draw <i>three antecedent boxes</i> for it (to its left), and <i>link 
them</i> to the Result.  Give them three different names e.g. 'I1', 'I2', 
'I3'.  (Note that this little inference net is not connected to the earlier 
one you drew.)
      <p>
18.  <i>Run this</i> wee inference net.  (<a href="#running">Step 12</a>: 
click over Result box with LMB to bring up its Action panel and hit Reset 
then Infer; 'running' an inference always involves hitting Reset, to clear 
out previous values, and Infer.)  The User Question panels will now show, 
not a slider value gadget, but a rectangle which says '0' and into which 
you can type a number.  In each of the three that comes up type a number, 
say 5, 6 and 7.
      <p>
19.  Hit the <i>Data</i> button on Result's Action panel, and its Attribute 
Details panel should appear, showing as its value the sum of the numbers 
you entered (18 for the above numbers).
      <p>
<a NAME="ok-act">
20.  To run it again there is a <b>short cut to the Action panel</b>, the 
<i>OK-Act</i> button</a> near its bottom.  Hit that.  (It short-cuts the 
process of hitting OK and then finding the box and clicking on it with 
LMB.)  The Attribute Action and Attribute Details panels form a pair, and 
each is accessible from the other: the OK-Act button brings up the Action 
panel and the Data button thereon brings up the Details panel.  Run it 
again, making sure this time that the three numbers you enter are all above 
1.
      <p>
<a NAME="change.im">
21.  <b>Different Inference Method</b></a>.  When the question sequence has 
stopped, hit the <i>Data</i> button to bring up the Details panel.  On 
about the fourth row you should see a radio button saying 'Inferred' and to 
its right a string in a slot that says "X = A + B, C, ...".  This is the 
<b>inference method</b> by which the values of all the antecedents are 
combined to give this attribute's value.  "X = A + B, C, ..." means "Add 
all the antecedent values together - X refers to this current attribute 
(labelled 'Result'), A refers to the first antecedent, B to the second, and 
so on.  You can <b>select another inference method</b>: attached at the 
left end of the slot is a <i>wee button; hit it with LMB</i>.  Up comes a 
list of inference methods.  <i>Select multiplication</i>, shown by "X = A * 
B, C, ...".  Hit the <i>OK</i> button on this list to send it away, and the 
string in your slot should be updated accordingly.
      <p>
22.  Now <i>run</i> the inference net again.  (<a href="#ok-act">Step 
20</a>: notice how convenient the OK-Act button is when you are changing 
things like inference method and trying it out.)  Make sure all numbers are 
above 1.  Look at the Result Data.  (If you entered 5, 6, 7 the result 
value should now be 210.)
      <p>
23.  <b>Suppressing irrelevant information</b>.  Note that Istar only asks 
questions that it needs to, and thus avoids asking irrelevant ones.  With 
multiplication this happens if one of the antecedents is zero - we then 
know the consequent will be zero, whatever values the remaining antecedents 
take, so there is no point asking them.  <i>Try it: run the inference net 
again (<a href="#ok-act">step 20</a>) and enter the second number as 0</i>. 
It should not then ask the third number.
      <p>
23a.  (There are various item types for which this effect can occur. 
Integers with multiply, Booleans with AND or OR, and anything with Chooser 
inference method, etc.)
      <p>
24.  <b>Short-cut to changing item type</b>.  The main way of selecting 
item type for your next box is to bring up the control screen, hit the item 
type listview gadget for the type you want.  A bit of a nuisance; there is 
a short-cut if you have a box of that type already showing on the Easel: 
<i>press 'T' for Type over that box</i> and Istar will select its type. 
You have two types, Bayesian and Integer, with (Free) Integer currently 
selected.  Ensure the Easel is active (<a href="#ensure.active">step 
10a</a>).  Then move the mouse pointer over one of your earlier Bayesian 
boxes and press the T key.  The item type should select Free Bayesian.  If 
you now draw a box it will be of Bayesian type.
      <p>
25.  <b>Automatic Type Conversion</b>.  Find some spare space on the Easel 
(<a href="#scrolling">step 16</a>), <i>create a (Free) Probability box</i> 
to the left and an Integer to the right.  <i>Link</i> the Probability box 
as antecedent of the Integer.  <i>Run</i> this little inference net; you 
should be presented with a slider in the User Question panel.  Slide the 
Probability to some suitable number, say 90.  Look at the value in the 
Integer attribute; it should say 90 (though early versions of Istar might 
be one out due to rounding errors in the gadget but not internally!).  As 
far as possible Istar intelligently converts from one value type to 
another.
      <p>
26.  <b>Some errors</b>.  Don't be scared of errors.  Try experiencing a 
few errors that might happen - if you have not already done so!  Most do 
not do any harm.
      <p>
      <li>  <b>Separating mouse from link end</b>.  You might have noticed
      that occasionally after starting to draw link the mouse pointer is
      separated slightly from the end of the link.  It happens because
      there is a very slight delay between pressing of LMB and appearance
      of the link, and in this delay the mouse could have moved away
      slightly.  Note that it is the end of the link that is the important,
      active point, not the mouse pointer.  So it is the end of the link
      that should be dropped into the target box, rather than the mouse
      pointer.  This feature is deliberate as it allows the mouse pointer
      to be moved out of the way of the active point, so you can see more
      clearly exactly where the end of the link is going.  Useful in a
      cluttered Easel.  (The same can also happen with drawing boxes,
      bending links, or whatever.)
      <p>
      <li>  <b>Link not formed</b>.  In drawing a link, if you release LMB
      such that the end of the link is over empty space then it will not be
      formed - because it must link to something.  This can happen when
      link end and pointer are separated and you place the pointer rather
      than link end over the box.
      <p>
      <li>  <b>Cannot link item to itself</b>.  With any box, start drawing
      a link from its right or left edge but release LMB while the end of
      the link is inside or on the edge of the same box.  An error panel
      appears.  Hit OK.
      <p>
      <li>  <b>Cannot create a cycle</b>.  With one of the inference nets
      you have drawn, start drawing a link from the right-hand edge of the
      right-most box and (<a href="#draw.link">step 6b</a>) bend it round
      to the left until it is over one of the antecedents, thus creating a
      cycle in the inference net.  This is not allowed; an error panel
      appears.  Hit OK.
      <p>
      <li>  <b>Invisible parts of net</b>.  Some keys hide parts of the
      net.  e.g. the A or C keys show antecedents and consequents of a box.
      Useful in simplifying a large net.  But if hit inadvertently can be
      confusing as you will see links ending in empty space etc.  If this
      has happened then <i>hit the Enter Key on numeric keypad</i>.  This
      restores all.  Another way, from version 1.08, is to hit the small
      'Sh' (for 'show all') button by the 'See Easel' button on the KB
      Panel.

<h2><a name="special">SPECIAL DRIVING</a></h2>
<!-- -->
<h3><a name="cli">STARTING FROM CLI</a></h3>
<!-- -->

To start Istar from CLI, simply type "Istar", maybe appending the version 
number if there is one.  (I assume that you are familiar with paths etc. or 
how to activate a program in another directory.)
      <p>
Advanced use:
      From CLI you can start with various tracing on, by adding the
parameters:
      <p>
<ul>
<li>  "-tm" to trace some activity in the modules mechanism
<li>  "-tu" to trace some UA module activity
<li>  "-te" to trace some activity among easels
<li>  "-td" to trace some drawing activity
</ul>
      <p>

so the command might be:
      <p>
      <code>Istar -tu -te</code>
      <p>
This will usually only be of value when you suspect some bug and want to 
send me a trace of what happens.

<h3><a name="low.mem">STARTING WITH LOW MEMORY</a></h3>
<!-- -->

The standard startup will just about start in a base 2 Mb A1200 as long as 
your Workbench screen is simple PAL 640 by 256 and only 4 colours.  But in 
other situations, from Version 1.04 onwards, you can take action to reduce 
the amount of memory needed for your KB, before you create it.  There are 
two ways of doing this.
      <p>
<h4><a name="low.mem1">LOW MEMORY METHOD 1:</a></h4>
<!-- -->
      <p>
This method involves starting up and immediately altering some of the 
preferences via the Prefs panel.
      <p>
<ul>
      <li>  As soon as the Initial Control Panel comes up, click on the
      Prefs button to bring up the Preferences panel.
      <p>
      <li>  Alter the MinDSA figure (usually 50000 longwords) to e.g.
      10000; this reduces the size of a new KB from around 200000 bytes to
      around 40000.
      <p>
      <li>  Alter the size of the Easel from 1920 by 1200 to something
      smaller, such as 640 by 256.  If its Depth is shown as 4 or higher
      reduce it to 3.  Doing these reduces the amount of memory for the
      Easel of a new KB.  The original size easel consumes around 200
      kbytes for each bitplane, whereas 640 by 256 consumes only around 20
      kbytes per bitplane.
</ul>
      <p>
Note, though, that you should only do this if you can work with a small KB 
or easel.  Note that doing this will not alter the sizes of KB or easel 
that are loaded from file - only brand new ones.

<h4><a name="low.mem2">LOW MEMORY METHOD 2:</a></h4>
<!-- -->

Altering the preferences each time you load up can be tedious.  So Istar 
can also load preferences from a file as it enters, which in version 1.04 
onwards is the file IstarSys:IstarPrefs (that is, IstarPrefs in the drawer 
to which IstarSys: is assigned).  So all you need to do is supply such a 
file, according to your needs.
      <p>
      A file, IstarPrefs_LowMem is already supplied, so you need only enter
the following command from a CLI:
      <p>
      <code>COPY IstarSys:IstarPrefs_LowMem IstarSys:IstarPrefs</code>
      <p>
Bring up the Prefs panel to see the sizes it has given you.  If you wish 
anything different then make up your own IstarPrefs file.  There are many 
other Preferences that can be set via this file.  See 'Preferences' section 
in the 'KBs' chapter for details.
      <p>

<h2><a name="concepts">SOME ISTAR CONCEPTS</a></h2>
<!-- -->

<h3><a name="item">What is an Item?</a></h3>
<!-- -->

An item in Istar is some focus of attention in your domain of knowledge 
which you wish to represent by an object in the knowledge base.  It is 
expressed on the Easel by a box, or group of boxes that move together.  An 
item can have:
      <p>
      <li>  any number of attributes (so far they have had only 1)
      <li>  relationships to other items
      <p>
On the Item Type list on the KB panel, select 'Text Fragment' ('Contract 
Meaning' in earlier versions).  This is an item expressed by two boxes, 
when you draw it on the Easel.  The top, smaller, box expressed the item 
itself, the bottom one an attribute of the item.
      <p>
      You can define your own item types.  Let's try doing so.  <i>Hit the
'New'</i> button beside (below, before version 1.08) the Item Type list.  A 
new panel, Item Type Panel, comes up for an item type called 'Unnamed'. 
<i>Change the name</i> to 'Employee'.
      <p>
      Now we will add attributes to the item type.  To add each attribute
to an item type we do three things:
<ol>
      <p>
<li>  1.  Set the type
<li>  2.  Set the name
<li>  3.  Set the meaning
</ol>
      <p>
(Before version 1.08, these steps were slightly different.)
      <p>
      So first, locate the Attributes panel list near the bottom of the
Item Type Panel, <i>hit its 'New'</i> button, and up comes a smaller panel 
requesting a new attribute.  On this panel, <i>select String</i> from the 
list of attribute typse, enter a <i>Name</i> below it of "EmpName", and 
then enter a <i>Meaning</i> such as "Employee's formal name".  Hit its 
<i>OK</i> button.  The panel should go, and 'EmpName' should appear in the 
Item Type's list of attributes.
      <p>
      Now repeat the process to <i>add an Age attribute</i> (using integer
attribute type).  Thirdly, create an attribute called <i>'Day off'</i> of 
Type 'Weekdays'.  Lastly, create an attribute called <i>'Salary'</i> of 
Type Integer.
      <p>
      Then press <i>OK</i> (called Done in some versions) on the Item Type
Panel, and it disappears.  Look at the Item Types panel list and you will 
see 'Employee' has been added at the bottom and should be selected (if not, 
select it).
      <p>
      Now <i>draw</i> on the Easel and you should get a tall box group with
five boxes: a smaller one at the top representing the employee itself, with 
four attribute boxes: EmpName, Age, Day off, Salary.
      <p>
      <i>Click with RMB in the item (top) box</i> to bring up the Item
Details Panel.  <i>Alter</i> its Name to e.g. 'John', and that will appear 
in the item box.  To give values to its attributes is a bit long-winded at 
present, and we will deal with this in <Using Istar - SN>.
      <p>
      Notice the similarity to databases: item = entity or record,
attribute = attribute or field.  Unlike many databases new item types can 
be created at any time.  And (from version 1.08) new attributes can be 
added to existing item types, and even to existing item instances.

<h3><a name="types">Types and Instances</a></h3>
<!-- -->

'Employee' is an <b>item type</b>.  John is one instance of the item type 
'Employee'.  It is instances that are expressed as boxes and arrows on the 
easel.
      <p>

<h3><a name="att">What is an Attribute?</a></h3>
<!-- -->

An attribute is a holder of a value - such as EmpName, Age, etc.  It can be 
of two types: <b>a property of an item</b> or <b>a free attribute</b>. 
Each attribute is expressed by a box.  When you started above, you were 
drawing (creating) free attributes.  When you drew the Employee box group 
you created an item with four property attributes.  Free attributes 
actually belong to a hidden item, for which there is no visible box.
      <p>
      Attributes can be of a variety of types ('domains' in database
jargon), which normally are defined in terms of value types (see below).
      <p>
      It became clear during the INCA research project that the
conventional picture, of items with several attributes, was not always 
appropriate.  In an inference net a lot of items exist merely to support a 
single attribute, and so Istar developed the idea of 'free attributes', in 
which the item is still there for structural purposes but is de-emphasized 
and not shown on the easel.  So in the Select Item Type panel list the 
first set of items is normally a load of free attributes.  They are 
represented by single boxes.  Whether they are called attributes or items 
is immaterial.
      <p>
