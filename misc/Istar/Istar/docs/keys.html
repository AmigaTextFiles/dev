#  Zoom in, so boxes are smaller, so you can see more of the net:  F10 key 
when mouse is placed where you want centre of KB diagram to be.
      <p>
#  Zoom out, so boxes are larger, so you see less of the net:  F9 key when 
mouse is placed where you want centre of KB diagram to be.
      <p>
#  Move KB as a whole, up, down, left, right:  Hit the cursor arrow keys 
situated between main and numeric keyboard.  The amount of movement is 1 
inch by default, as set in the Prefs panel.
      <p>
#  Create space in the net, a vertical column:  F3 key, and all boxes to 
right of where mouse happens to be will be moved to right by 1 inch.  All 
arrows are modified to follow the boxes as necessary.
      <p>
#  Create space in the net, a horizontal row:  F4 key, and all boxes below 
where mouse happens to be will be moved down by 1 inch.  All arrows are

<h2><a name="hiding">TO DO WITH HIDING AND SHOWING PARTS OF NET</a></h2>

Most of these use the numeric keypad by default.
      <p>

right of numeric keypad.  (NOT the return key).
      <p>

'+' (Plus) key on numeric keypad.
      <p>
#  To show the attributes that are antecedent to the one over which the 
mouse is resting:  'a' key.  With this you can find which input information 
is relevant to a given attribute.

is relevant to a given attribute.
      <p>

      <p>
#  To show the attributes or items linked to a given topic:  (First hide 
all with '0' key) then hit the topic number 1..9 on numeric keypad.  These 
are accumulative, in that if you hit 0 (to clear) and then 1 and 4 you will 
see those things that are linked to either topic 1 or topic 4 or both.
      <p>

<h2><a name="ir">TO DO THINGS TO OR WITH ITEMS OR RELATIONSHIPS</a></h2>
<!-- -->

attribute or item details panel, over arrow to bring up relationship 
details panel.
      <p>

attribute action panel.  At present, items and relationships have no 
action.
      <p>
#  To select item/attribute type to be similar to a given one:  hit 'T' key 
(for 'type') when mouse is over the item or attribute box of type wanted.
      <p>
#  To set link weight to negative or positive while drawing:  hit '-' or 
'+' key on main keyboard (NOT numeric keypad) while you are in the process 
of drawing.
      <p>
#  To bend a link while drawing it:  hit space bar when end of line being 
drawn is at position for bend.
      <p>
#  To delete a vertex (bend point) of a line:  hit 'Del' key (next to 
'help') while you are moving the vertex.
      <p>
#  To minimize or maximize the size of a box expressing a free attribute, 
place mouse over it and hit the M key.
      <p>
