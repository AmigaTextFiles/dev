<h2><a name="limitations">LIMITATIONS</a></h2>
<!-- -->

The current version of Istar has a number of limitations.  Some of them 
include:
      <p>
#  Cannot import to KB from another KB.
      <p>
#  The FIRSTOK inference method (Present Each To User) not yet
implemented.
      <p>
#  Cannot use the Import-Text yet on items.
      <p>
#  Cannot at present delete value names from an attribute type; can only 
add them.
      <p>
#  Certain obscure conversions between value types do not work fully; best 
to try them out before you use them.  e.g. Float to Odds.  Proportion, Prob 
and Bayes to Ordinal does not work.
      <p>
#  The new text/document facility is at present very limited.
      <p>
#  Warning:  CONTROL unary operator will not always work on a Chooser 
attribute, unless it is the first antecedent.

<h2><a name="bugs">BUGS</a></h2>
<!-- -->

This is a list of some bugs you should be aware of that are either in the 
current version or were found in earlier versions and not yet diagnosed and 
corrected.  Older bugs, now fixed, are listed below by version.
      <p>
<a NAME="gfx.cards">
# (Nuisance for those using graphics cards. Reported November 1999)  I've 
had one report from someone using Istar with a graphics card</a> that it is 
very slow.  I have asked for details, but few have been forthcoming yet, 
except that they say that it takes 15 seconds for the screen to come up! 
This is being investigated.  But Istar does rely quite heavily on some 
features that are unique to the Amiga hardware, especially smooth scrolling 
of different screens.  However, another person reported some time ago that 
Istar works OK with UAE on a PC.  Being investigated.

      <p>
<a NAME="wrong.value.lines">
# (Visual nuisance; can be misleading: Noted 12 November 1999)  Sometimes 
you find that the value line in an attribute box does not seem to respond 
to changes in value.  This can be because (somehow) there is an easelpiece 
for the value line but the attribute has its Show Value deactivated. 
Result: Because Show is inactive forward chaining will not take the time to 
look for and alter the value line easelpiece.  So it remains as it was. 
SOLUTION:  Tick Show gadget on 2nd line of <a href= 
"panels.html#adp">Attribute Details Panel</a>, then hit OK, then untick the 
Show box, and hit OK.  Should then be correct.
      <p>
# (Intermittent oddity that can be a nuisance, reported by John Evans.) 
Easel boxes can lose their labels.  Occasionally, while you have been 
working on KBs for some time, you move a box and find that its label text 
stays behind on the screen and that the box now has no text in it. 
Thereafter, no boxes are drawn with text: all empty.  If you do a redraw, 
you end up with empty boxes all over.  The only way to cure it is to save 
your KB - don't worry, the texts are still there - and quit Istar, possibly 
reboot in case there is memory corruption, and restart Istar and reload 
your KB.  It seems to occur after you have run out of chip memory for 
panels.  Being investigated.  Top-right button on control screen 
(unlabelled) can set tracing so I can see what is happening in the text 
drawing routine.
      <p>
#  (Tiny cosmetic nuisance introduced by fixing inability to set Show on 
attributes of item types)  When you have an itemtype with an attribute that 
is ticked as Show, then when you first create the box for the item 
instance, the values are not shown.  However, all you have to do is get the 
box redrawn, such as moving it a fraction, and the lines appear.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance)  For an item type with its own box, if you make it of a 
different size than standard, then draw an item of this type, the box that 
follows the mouse is not the new size but the standard size.  However it 
then pops to the correct size when you let go of the mouse.  2 June 1998
      <p>
#  (Rare but unavoidable if you need it)  Multiplying two ratios in which 
one has a negative number does not work.  1/-6 times 12/1 gives 6/65533.
      <p>
#  (Harmless nuisance 'feature')  If you create a new attribute type and 
set its pens, and then create a free attribute item type for it, then 
sometimes boxes of this will be the new colours and sometimes not.  What 
happens is that if you set the pens and hit the 'Create Free Att Item Typ' 
button, it is created with the old pens - because it only copies the new 
pens etc. across when you hit the OK button.  But if you do not hit that 
button but hit OK after setting the pens, and create the FAIT afterwards, 
then it will have the new pens.  Note that from v1.083 onwards, if you hit 
the OK button without a FAIT it will ask whether you wish one created - and 
ones created there will have the new pens.
      <p>

#  (Harmless nuisance)  If you start to create a new item type (and 
relationship type) then hit 'Cancel' the type is not actually deleted; you 
get a type with a null (dash) name and have to hit the 'Rid' button to 
remove it.  This is because it first creates a null-named type and then 
allows you to change its details.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance)  Recently I had things like DirOpus loaded, and went to load 
up three KBs with full size easels.  Then tried to 'rid' a KB and nothing 
happened.  Tried to quit and nothing happened.  Because I had run out of 
Chip memory and the small "Is it OK to rid the KB?" panel would not come 
up!  (Chip memory was down to 13k.)  But beware: there is no warning, and 
none can be given because the warning panel will not come up.
      <p>
#  (Harmless limitation)  Various buttons are not operative yet:
<ul>
<li>  Clone item type
<li>  Import text into item
<li>  You might find others that either flash or do nowt
</ul>
      <p>
#  (Harmless limitation)  Conversion Float to Odds does not work.
      <p>
#  (Could lead to unexpected results in your KB)  When a conversion does 
not work you do not get any warning of this fact.  What happens depends on 
the type of conversion, but often the result holds the bit pattern of the 
uncoverted value, which might of course seem like rubbish, or might hold 0. 
30 July 1996.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance, unlikely to be encountered)  I have a couple of old KBs which 
have a 8-colour easel and in which pen 7 is white, like the background 
colour, so things drawn in this pen appear invisible.  I alter the colour 
on the Easel Info menu, and save the KB, but for some reason it doesn't 
save properly.  The reason is that in older KBs the palette was stored 
differently.


<h2><a name="crashes">CRASHES ENCOUNTERED</a></h2>
<!-- -->

(Please: it you have it crash on you, send me details.  <a 
href="mailto:Istar@basden.u-net.com">Istar@basden.u-net.com</a>).  The 
following crashes I have experienced and not yet found the cause of.
      <p>
#  (1.04: Probably OK from 1.05. Can cause crash, but avoidable)  The 
resize KB facility can be a bit fragile and can cause a crash in version 
1.04.  This is because if the KB increases in size it moves in memory and 
therefore all the pointers into it must all be changed.  I *think* I have 
found all these, but I did once get a guru 81---5 (attempt to free memory 
already freed) when I quit the program.  I have a feeling it was something 
to do with resizing.  For this reason, before you attempt to resize you 
should close down all panels except that for the KB itself.
      <p>

<h2><a name="bugs.fixed">BUGS FIXED</a></h2>
<!-- -->

      <h3><a name="v1.14">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.14, April 2000
      </a></h3><!-- -->

#  (Rare possible crashing; never knowingly experienced)  The main input 
routine could, in some very rare circumstances, be called recursively and 
in that case when it returned from an inner call it might crash because the 
variables it had when it recursed might no longer be valid.  This has been 
fixed by using globals.

      <h3><a name="v1.13">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.13 (not published, Jan 2000)
      </a></h3><!-- -->

#  (Stupid nuisance!)  Previously, something crazy happened on the <a href= 
"panels.html#idp">item details panel</a>: if you hit the 'rid' button on 
the list of antecedents or consequents, you were asked to confirm, but if 
you hit the Delete button, to get rid of the whole item, you were not!  So 
I reversed that.  Also on the <a href= "panels.html#ri">relationship 
instance</a> and <a href= "panels.html#aap">attribute action</a> panels.

      <h3><a name="v1.12">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.12, November 1999
      </a></h3><!-- -->

<a NAME="form.odds">
# (Unavoidable but rare error, from version 1.1, noted 20 November 1999) 
Form input of ODDS or other multi-part values only fills in the first 
part.</a>

      <p>
<a NAME="esIM_GE">
# (Error in many versions since before 1998)  For some time I have found 
that the inference methods >= and <= did not work correctly</a>, always 
giving a result of true.  John Evans also reported it a year or more ago, 
but I could never find the cause.  It was an indirect error, rather hidden. 
Fixed 1.12.  (Turns out that an included file had a define of 
<code>qqCPF_GE/LE</code> as <code>qqCPF_GT/LT | qqCFP_EQ</code> without 
brackets round it.  So <code>return( qqCPF_GE & result )</code> would not 
give what we expect, but would AND one part of _GE with result and then OR 
that with the other part - which of course would always yield a non-zero 
result!).
      <p>
<a NAME="ksv.form">
# (Error in server forms that affected the ICT KB, since version 1.0). 
When there were more than about 6 gadgets on a HTML form, some of the later 
ones could be cut off due to truncation of the input line</a>.  The reason 
was similar to <a href= "#esIM_GE">above</a>: the test <code>if ( svCSF_EOF 
| svCSF_EOL & r ) ..</code> (where the svCSF_ are defined constant flags) 
will always return true because the & is evaluated before the |.



      <h3><a name="v1.11">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.11, October 1999
      </a></h3><!-- -->

Version 1.11 was placed on my website for a short time, but not on Aminet.
      <p>
<a NAME="1.1.zna">
# (Nuisance only in version 1.1, that could in theory cause crashes though 
it was never known to.)</a>  When running as a Knowledge Server, the log 
did not show the IP Address of the incoming connection correctly.  In fact 
it showed a static random number.  The cause was that, in accepting a 
connection using <code>accept()</code> the size of buffer was not set.  In 
fact the variable used, <code>zna</code>, was on the stack and always 
seemed to have the value 1, which meant that only one byte was plaved in 
buffer, and this did not include the IP address.  (Because it always seemed 
to be 1, it was safe, and did not overwrite the end of the buffer, causing 
a crash.  But I am putting out verson 1.11 in case it sometimes does so.) 
Remedy for user: nothing; get version 1.11.  Corrected in version 1.11.
      <p>
<a NAME="1.1.wtp">
# (Nuisance only in version 1.1)</a>  The <a href= 
"panels.html#wtp">Weights Panel</a>, when showing multi-part weights (such 
as bayesian weights) and the user clicked OK, only updated the first part 
and left all the other parts untouched.  Remedy for user using version 1.1: 
you must bring up the individual <a href= "panels.html#ri">Relationship 
Instance Panels</a> for each weight and set it individually.  Corrected in 
version 1.11.
      <p>
<a NAME="1.1.stop">
# (Mystery.  Could be a major nuisance, but only happened once.)</a>  Once 
I found that the knowledge server demo site had stopped.  That is, on the 
log was a message saying 'Knowledge server stopped' and though Istar was 
still running OK, the server module was not.  No reason could be found for 
stopping.  Examination of the code could find no reason for stopping other 
than deliberate stopping by hitting a button.  It might be that someone 
clicked the Stop button, but nobody was (supposed to be) around.  No idea. 
But I've simplified version 1.11 and made it log a reason for stopping.
      <p>
# (Tiny rare nuisance.  All previous versions.)  Link a Form item to a 
bayesian attribute, and bring up its Relationship Instance panel.  It gives 
you a weight and unary operator.  If you alter the uop to be negate etc. 
then it changes the colour of link to the negative pen.



      <h3><a name="V.1.1">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.1, September 1999
      </a></h3><!-- -->

# (Intermittent crashes in rare circumstances up to and including version 
1.092):  If there is not enough memory to open a KB's easel (in normal 
usage), it would just load KB without it but expect it to be there, and 
gave no error; crashes.  Fixed in version 1.1.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance up to and including version 1.092):  A long-standing memory 
leak which could occur when hitting Quit and letting Istar remove all the 
KBs automatically (but which did not occur when you hit the Rid button for 
the KB).  Fixed in version 1.1.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance up to and including version 1.092):  Load two KBs, X,Y.  Then 
do 'see easel' for X.  Wave mouse around and the name window shows items in 
Y, not X.  After a long time I found that aWorkWindow was not set to the 
proper easel before pgShowWork() was called.  It did switch OK, but 
immediately on a mousemove it switched to the Y KB.  Fixed in version 1.1.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance up to and including version 1.092):  CONTROL inference 
relationship.  Doesn't seem to work properly. Trees.2.  Infer from frost. 
And its infce session waits at end for some time (loop?).  Then frost is 
not ans.  Probably this bug had been introduced by changes to some earlier 
version.  Fixed in version 1.1.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance up to and including version 1.092):  Allocation of string 
values is now OK.  In previous versions, we had the following but:  RI 
panel:  For relshp to cons that is String: Change to UO CONTROL, OK,  then 
bring rel up again, enter string value, OK, bring it up again and no sign 
of string. Various reasons.  Some in RI.  Some in qqbl.  It was mainly to 
do with qqAllocVal().  See log:Log.990703.  Fixed in version 1.1 by 
rationalizing allocation of variable length values in qq module.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance up to and including version 1.092):  String to float 
conversion did not work.  Fixed in version 1.1.
      <p>
#  (Cosmetic nuisance up and incl version 1.092; 25 February 1999)  List of 
Relationship types sometimes shows the inverse names rather than real 
names.  Fixed 25 February 1999 by making the name-finding more 
sophisticated so that for a reltype it gives a pair: 'main/inv'.

      <h3><a name="v.1.092">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.092
      </a></h3><!-- -->
      <p>
#  Fixed a bug introduced into version 1.09, in which item instances were 
not linked to their boxgroups.
      <p>
#  All known Enforcer Hits has been removed.  Four were found: a read of 
location 0 when bringing up file requester for first time, a read of 
location 0 when the main easel of a KB was being displayed, and a couple 
which wrote to locations 0x20, 0x28 when creating a new KB.  (All previous 
versions were subject to these hits.)
      <p>

#  (4 February 1999 Version 1.09 and 1.091 only.  Nuisance.)  When item 
blocks are created they are not linked with the box group that expresses 
them.  This does not seem to be a problem in most cases since Istar has 
built-in redundancy, and several ways to find one from the other.  FIXED 4 
February 1999.
      <p>

      <h3><a name="v1.09">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.09 AND 1.091
      </a></h3><!-- -->
#  (4 February 1999 all versions; usually no more than a nuisance)  For 
Float variables, when you exit the <a href= "adp.html" >Attribute Details 
Panel</a> then it will always consider the value to have changed, even 
though you have not changed it.  This will force a propagation, but 
normally this makes no difference except to waste a bit of time.  The 
exception is if the consequent fan of the Float attribute has a Random 
inference method or unary operator in it; then a different random number 
will be propagated.  FIXED 4 February 1999.
      <p>
#  (27 January 1999.  Version 1.09 and 1.087.  Version 1.086 is OK.  Error 
that maybe cannot be overcome.  Fixed 27 January 1999.)  Chooser inference 
method does not seem to work properly with integer first antecedent.  It 
works fine when the chosen antecedents are all Constant, but in other 
situations none of them are asked, and the inference session ends without 
having answered the goal.  FIXED 27.1.99.
      <p>
#  (Nuisance that can be overcome: Version 1.09, and presumably earlier 
versions; 1 January 1999)  Select a free attribute item type, 'See' it, 
select its single attribute, 'See' that, and hit the 'Show' checkbox so 
that it is ticked.  What should happen is that boxes drawn for this 
attribute should then have their values shown.  But it doesn't.  Instead, a 
Beep/Flash happens and then we get an ES module error 'Some parameter is 
wrong'.  I will look into it.  FIXED 4 January 1999, but left another small 
bug.
      <p>
#  (Cosmetic)  The font used for the number that varies with slider gadgets 
is usually the Question text, rather than the standard text.  It can look 
odd - or even look good.  FIXED 2 January 1999.
      <p>


      <h3><a name="v.1.087">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.087 Oct-Nov 1998
      </a></h3><!-- -->
#  (Nuisance during run)  When in an inference session with a goal list, 
the <code>ResetQ</code> button showed only those questions asked for the 
current goal, rather than since the start of the session.  This has been 
fixed Sep 98.
      <p>
#  (Avoidable crash: most versions before 1.087)  If you have an attribute, 
bring up its attribute action panel and start the inference process and 
have a question being asked, and then hit the 'Data' button on the action 
panel to bring up the attribute details panel, and then hit its OK, when 
you hit the OK of the question being asked, then you get software error 
00000003.  I don't think it happens if the question sequence is started 
from the InferGoals button.  It seems that the problem occurs because the 
action panel has been closed before the inference process ends, so that it 
returns to a wrong panel.  3 November 1998.  Fixed 3 Nov 1998.
      <p>
#  (Cosmetic nuisance)  Altering font Preferences for question text seemed 
to have no effect; now does.  Font for document was altered when you zoom 
it; now OK.

      <h3><a name="v1.086">
FIXED BY VERSION 1.086  March 1998
      </a></h3><!-- -->
#  (Rare nuisance, avoidable)  When you have a UO_CONTROL <a 
href="uop.html">unary operator</a> to a consequent whose inference method 
is FirstKnown or Chooser (or perhaps others of that ilk), then when the 
controlling antecedent is false, the consequent receives a value of zero 
rather than that in the relationship.  To avoid this, change the inference 
method to e.g. addition, max, bayesian, etc.
      <p>
#  (Rare nuisance)  If you had an ORDINAL or ENUM antecedent e.g. Weekdays 
and tried to set the <a href="uop.html">unary operator</a> to EqualTo, then 
it would not do so.  Now it does.  (The bug only affected ORDINALs and 
ENUMs.)  A reason for doing this is to convert an enum to a boolean saying 
e.g. 'It is Wednesday'.
      <p>
#  (Common problem if you used strings)  String concatenation did not work 
well.  String chooser did not work at all.  String 'IsIn' and 'HasIn' 
inference did not work.  At least not since 1.06.  Fixed 1.086.
      <p>
#  (Rare nuisance)  Up to 1.086 with some attribute types you were offered 
a 'Remove From' inference method (opposite of Concat).  It has never been 
implemented yet.  I just suppressed the possibility of using this.

#  (A freeze if not a crash!)  There's an odd sort of bug when Istar runs 
up on some machines.  It's perfectly OK on the three 1200s that I have 
tried it on (020 and 030).  But when I run it up on my 4000 it comes up 
with the main easel and the SIT (Select Item Type) panel and all, but won't 
draw, and won't respond to clicks on the main control panel.  Until, that 
is, I click around on the SIT panel.  Sometimes dragging the listview 
scroll bar around helps, and then clicking to select an item type, 
sometimes clicking on the 'New' button.  Then there is a delay of a few 
seconds, and everything starts as normal.  Strange.  But, as I say, on my 
three 1200s it seems perfectly OK.  9.9.96: I have found a possible cause 
of this and corrected it, but have yet to try it out.  No, it does not work 
yet, Nov 1996.  I got an email to say that it froze their 3000 too.  While 
preparing 1.05 I found a slight error in the code, changed it, and then it 
seemed to work on my 4000 and 3000.  So hopefully it's now OK.

<h3><a name="v1.04">BUGS FIXED BY VERSION 1.04 (Nov 1996)</a></h3>
<!-- -->

#  (Harmless Cosmetic)  When you change the name of an item, it doesn't 
redraw with the new name until F1 or next load.  Attribute names refresh 
OK.  Version 1.03 and before.
      <p>
#  (Harmless Nuisance)  When trying to resize an item using right-shift, 
you have to place the mouse *exactly* on the edge of the box: hit-vicinity 
is zero.  Otherwise you will start to draw a link or move the box; if that 
happens then just hit escape.  Version 1.03 and before.  (Actually, it was 
not the need for exact positioning: it required a second attempt.  A bug in 
window switching.)
      <p>
#  (Harmless cosmetic)  When you start drawing on the main easel and abort 
by hitting escape you get a beep-flash.  Don't worry: nothing is wrong. 
Version 1.03 and before.
      <p>
#  (Harmless nuisance)  New facility in Version 1.03, Resizing of KBA, 
doesn't work; it leaves the KBA as it is.
      <p>
#  (Harmless nuisance)  The Backup button on the KB Area panel (Version 
1.03) has no effect.
      <p>
#  (Harmless cosmetic nuisance)  Renaming the KB Area sometimes leaves 
rubbish characters at the end.  Version 1.03.
      <p>
#  (Harmless, cosmetic)  When you reset an attribute that is in the middle 
of a network it propagates the unanswered status OK, but does not show this 
change in status on the easel.  So if the Att is e.g. Bayesian and Shown it 
retains the solid black line.
      <p>
#  (Frustrating but probably harmless)  Version 1.03:  When you have two 
KBs active, and go to the Item Type Panel, and hit the Left or Right 
RelTypes buttons nothing happens.  But when you get rid of all but one then 
the list of RelTypes appears OK.  5 August 1996.  This is being 
investigated.
      <p>
<h3><a name="v1.03">BUGS FIXED BY VERSION 1.03 (Sep 1996)</a></h3>
<!-- -->

#  FIXED.  Version 1.02:  Never press the three right hand gadgets of the 
name/meaning bar unless a knowledge base is present.  It will probably 
crash the machine or send it into an infinite loop since they assume one is 
present.  2 August 1996.  This has been corrected in version 1.03.
      <p>
#  Version 1.02:  When redirecting a link the DAG cycle detection algorithm 
sometimes says there is a loop when there is not.  2 August 1996.  This is 
being investigated.  12 September 1996: I have found the bug: it 
occasionally searched from the wrong node.  Now it should be OK in Version 
1.03.
      <p>
#  Version 1.02.  It occasionally crashed while linking two items.  I have 
found a bug that could do this, and corrected it.  Version 1.03 should be 
OK.
      <p>
