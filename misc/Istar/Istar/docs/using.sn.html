<h1>USING ISTAR - FOR SEMANTIC NETS</h1>

In the previous chapter, <a href="using.html">Using Istar - For
Inference</a>, we concentrated on inference nets; now we turn to semantic
nets which, in the simple form supported by Istar, are like the Mind Maps
common in the decision support arena.  Istar isn't yet ideal for these, but
can still be very useful - the intention is to make it better.

<p>
      (If you have not already done so, you should read at least the first
few sections of <a href="using.html">Using Istar - For
Inference</a> (and before that, <a href="driving.html">Driving
Istar</a>) before proceeding further since it covers some of the basic
operations that we shall here assume you are familiar with.)
<p>

      A <b>semantic net</b> is a collection of items linked with
relationships.  The formalism was originally proposed in the artificial
intelligence community in the 1970s as an aid to storing sentences on
computer: each piece of the sentence was an item, and various relationships
held them together to make the whole text.  But today semantic nets are
seen more as a flexible kind of data storage.  Istar offers some, but not
all, of this flexibility.
<p>

      For semantic nets items and relationships are all important;
attributes are less important.  So we need to create new types of
relationship and item for use in our net.  But, after reading <a
href="using.html">Using Istar - For Inference</a>, you should
have enough experience of Istar to be able to do this by yourself after
reading the <a href="panels.html">Panels</a> chapter, in its sections on
creating new item and relationship types.  So, instead of step by step
instructions on how to create these, we will look at an example.  (This
part of the tutorial applies only to versions 1.03 and later.)
<p>

#  <i>Load the 'Philosophy' knowledge base</i> and examine it.  It
portrays some of the flow of philosophical thought up to the time just
before the Reformation and Renaissance, as a semantic net.  The net is
based on, and is my interpretation of, <i>Survey of the History of
Philosophy</i>, classroom teaching notes by John Van Dyk, Professor of
Philosophy, Dordt.
<p>

#  It shows many of the major Western philosophers and how they influenced
each other's thinking.  Each has a name, a date and, as meaning, a brief
description of their philosophical stance.  Move the mouse around to see
their stances.  (The item type, <b>Philosopher</b>, was created for this KB
by hitting the 'New' button adjoining the <a href="panels.html#itl">item 
types list</a> on the KB panel.)
<p>

#  There is an <b>'Influence' relationship</b> linking some of them.  This
shows that, for instance, the thinking of Socrates influenced the thinking
of both Plato and the Cynics.  (This type of relationship was created
specially for this KB, using the 'New' button below the relationship types
list on the KB panel.)
<p>

#  Some influence links are a different colour; they show a negative
influence, in that the later thinking reacted against the earlier and
developed in an opposing direction.  For instance, Tertullian called Plato
"the father of all error".
<p>

#  Peruse the whole KB, and see what you pick up about philosophers and how
Western thinking developed up to the Middle Ages.  Alter things if you
disagree with them.
<p>

#  It is often useful to see the consequents or antecedents of a given
thing.  Move over to the right and place the mouse cursor over the name box
of Tertullian.  <i>Press the 'A' key</i> (A for antecedent; before
version 1.06, press the * key on the numeric pad instead; it was changed to
'A' because some Amigas did not have that key, and to make it a bit easier
to remember wbich key to press).  You will see most of the net disappear,
showing only those philosophers and streams of thought that contributed to
Tertullian's thought (i.e. were antecedent to it).
<p>

#  Notice how Tertullian reacted against Plato (negative link), but at the
same time was positively influenced by the Stoics, who were themselves
positively influenced by Plato.  This sounds like a <b>contradiction</b> -
when, from one box to another, you have two paths of which one is negative
and one is positive.  It is not necessarily so, since Tertullian probably
absorbed some Platonic ideas while rejecting others.
<p>

#  Now move the mouse cursor over Plato and <i>press the 'C' key</i>
(C for consequents; not available before version 1.06).  The net shows now
all those philosophers and philosophical systems that have been influenced
by Plato, either directly or indirectly - very many of them.
<p>

#  Notice four things:
<ul>

<li>First, notice how you do actually learn something new by <b>perusing
the KB</b>; it is like a book.  (But, in this basic version, don't expect
to learn too much!)
<p>

<li>Second, notice how certain items, such as Plato and Aristotle, have
many (consequent) relationships; their influence in philosophy is
acknowledged to be great.  A high branching factor is a visual indication
that an item is a key item in the domain of knowledge.
<p>

<li>Third, if you know something of philosophy, you might wonder whether
some links are missing; some undoubtedly are, but notice how it has
stimulated you to think - a form of knowledge refinement mentioned above.
<p>

<li>Fourth, many of the terms you will not understand.  In a mind map this
can be a problem, so when you make up a mind map, think about how to make
things more understandable.

</ul>

<p>

      The Philosophy KB bundled with version 1.03 and later of Istar is
fairly basic, and will hopefully be extended in the near future, especially
to use Topics.

      <h3><a name="edge.rels">
Drawing Different Relationship Types
      </a></h3><!-- -->

In creating a semantic net you often want to vary the relationship type 
that you draw from an item, and so want to do so easily.  While this could 
be done by bringing up the <a href= "panels.html#rtl">RelType List</a> and 
selecting the relationship type you require each time, Istar provides a 
more direct ('proximal') way of doing so, for up to four (or even 5) 
different types.
      <p>
You create a new relationship by drawing from the edge of a box.  But a box 
has four edges, so Istar allows you to define a different relationship type 
to draw from each edge if you wish: this gives you four different types. 
(The fifth is given by the Relationship Qualifier key, usually left Alt, in 
which case, whatever edge you draw from, if you hold down the key at the 
start, it will attempt to draw a relationship of the type currently 
selected.)
      <p>
So, on the <a href= "panels.html#itp">Item Type Panel</a>, you are offered 
four gadgets, to set the Relationship Type to draw from each edge.  You can 
either select a Rel Type or 'None'.
      <p>
Note, however, that when 'None' is selected, top and bottom behaves a 
little differently from left and right.  Left and right are considered the 
main direction, and have slightly more intelligence in selecting a default 
type.  With top and bottom, if you select 'None', then no relationship can 
be drawn from that edge (unless you hold down the Rel Qualifier key, in 
which case you get the one selected in the RelTypes List.)  But with left 
and right, if you select 'None' then Istar tries to work out if there is a 
default type of relationship for a few of its types of item.  These 
include:
      <ul>
<li> For an Attribute box, the default, from both left and right edges, is 
Inference.
<li> For a Form item box, the default from its right hand edge is a 
Contains relationship.
<li> For a Text Fragment item box (top box) the default from either left or 
right hand edges is Precedence relationship.
      </ul>
Further, if the item type does not have a default that Istar can work out, 
then the type selected in the RelType List is chosen.
      <p>
(This means that you will always draw a relationship from left or right 
sides, whereas you can switch off drawing relationships from top and/or 
bottom.)
