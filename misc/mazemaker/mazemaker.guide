@node Intro

                         Introduction

The Mazemaker is shareware ! 
I started coding for about a half year. First it
was written in pure assembler-code but its to much work to make it easy to use.
So i have rewritten the MazeMaker. It is now pure C/C++-code :).
I decided to make the MazeMaker because it is not easy to create the dungeons of
a 3D-Dungeongame without a powerful tool.
Now i am writing a 3D-Dungeongame and so i need this tool very much and i asked
me: why should other 3D-Dung... programmers out there not have that luck to have
the chance to use this powerful MazeMaker ? 
The only thing to do is :
