PManager is a program which helps you manage C projects. It uses
Listtree custom class for hierarchical appearance, like in StormC. You
needn't any project file, just run PManager with path name and it will
scan directory for files. Edit config file to use your C environment,
SAS/C default.

Features:

 - Management of multiple projects.
 - Projects hotlist.
 - Configurable contents of project sections.
 - "Message" window for compiler output (Message Browser).
 - Support for Hierarchical Projects.
 - Asynchronous making/building projects.
 - Use "mkmk" utility for auto "makefile" creation. (SAS/C)
 - Configurable "Tools" menu for using external tools (profiler,grep,...).
 - Support of GoldED and SAS/C SE text editors (others through "scmsg"
   utility).
 - GUI for SAS/C "grep" utility.
 - And others...

@next glo_config
@{b}Installation@{ub}

Double-click on the install icon. Follow the prompts. If you not use
SAS/C compiler go to the @{"Configuration" LINK glo_config}.

If you update previous PManager versions, installer will save "old"
config files with ".bak" extension.

@{b}"PManager.config" file@{ub}

------- SAS/C default -----------
edit     = FROM_SCMSG
compile  = sc
make     = smake
build    = smake -u
debug    = sc:c/cpr -w
makefile = mkmk force target
options  = scopts
run_out  = CON:0/50//130/PManager/CLOSE/AUTO/WAIT
------- SAS/C default -----------

Edit "PManager.config" file to use your editor, compiler etc.. By
default it is SAS/C environment. When need it, file name from the
project will be added by PManager to the end of the lines: "compile",
"debug", "makefile". For example "sc test.c", "mkmk target test", "cpr
test".

"make","build" and "options" are tools that have no args(from PManager).

"edit"     - FROM_SCMSG : read editor configuration from the "scmsg"
	     utility options. If you haven't SAS/C compiler this line
	     should look like this:
	     "edit= your_editor" (example: "edit= ed").

"compile"  - usually frontend to compiler.
"make"     - "make" utility (make, cmake, ...)
"build"    - "make" utility but with "build key".
"debug"    - debugger you want to use.
"makefile" - "mkmk" is a SAS/C tool  which  makes  developing one target
	     projects  easy (no  need  to  edit makefile).

"options"  - utilities like "scopts" help to edit  many  config  options
	     for CLI compiler(include directories, defines, data & code
	     models, debug info, cpu, optimizer and others) and linker
	    (libs & objects to add) and save them to locale options file.

"run_out"  - console output/input from tools and project's target.

@{b}"PManager.sections" file@{ub}

In this file you can find all sections of the project recognized by
PManager. You can add/delete patterns to the sections or delete
sections. Don't change sections names and blank lines between sections,
don't change "Others" section!

@next glo_menus
@{b}Starting program@{ub}

PManager can be running from CLI or Workbench.

@{u}Starting from CLI:@{uu}

"PManager [dir] ... "

If you supply PManager with dir names, it will open windows with
contents of that dirs. Example:

"PManager work:projects/hello_world!"

If this project directory contains source files, makefile, etc. the
window will list them in correspondent sections, if "hello_world!" is
empty you can start creating this project. Running PManager without
directory names will popup requester telling you to select project
directory.

@{u}Starting from Workbench:@{uu}

PManager will popup requester, telling you to select project directory.

@{b}Starting new project@{ub}

Lets create "hello_world!" project:

Start PManager, in popup requester choose directory where you want to
create "hello_world!" directory, OK. Then, select "Create Dir..." from
'Project' menu and in open requester enter "hello_world!". Select "New
File..." and enter "hello_world.c". The editor window will be open with
"hello_world.c" file. Write:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void main()
{
    puts("Hello, World!");
}

Save file. Now, you have section - "Sources" with "hello_world.c" file.
Then, if you have SAS/C, just select "Make All..." in 'Compile' menu and
in open requester enter target name - "hello_world!".

If you haven't SAS/C, you need to create "makefile", by selecting "New
File...".

The making progress will be shown in the "Message" window. At the end,
press "Run" button to execute target.

@{b}Projects Hotlist@{ub}

You can save current project to the "Projects Hotlist" by selecting
"Snapshot" option ('Project' menu). Project will appear in "New", "Open"
and "Close" menu options as sub-menu item.

If you want to "forget" about some project choose it from "Close" option
and then "Snapshot".

"UnSnapshot" delete all projects in Hotlist file.

@{b}"Run..." option @{ub}

Select this option to execute project's target. In the Run window you
can also configure target start/debug: from CLI (with arguments) or
Workbench.

@{b}"Message" window @{ub}

This window list all compiler output. If making/building was successful
the Run and Debug buttons are enable.

To use SAS/C Message Browser capabilities of the "Message" window, you
need to choose "Options" from 'Compile' menu, and in "Message
Options..." select "NoErrorRexx", "ErrorConsole", "NoErrorSource".

Double-click or press Enter on the line with error/warning message to
invoke editor.

@{b}"Generate makefile..." option (SAS/C)@{ub}

When you create/add/delete source or header files in the project
directory, you will need to (Re)"Generate makefile...".

If you want to change target name: delete "old" target file, then choose
"Generate makefile..." and enter new target name.

@{b}Hierarchical Projects@{ub}

You can include other projects (it may also be docs, reference material,
etc) to the currently open. Choose "Add..." option to add sub-projects,
they will appear in the "Projects" section. If you double-click on one,
it will be open in the new window. Select "Make/Build All Hierarchical"
to make all (sub)projects.

Don't forget to "Snapshot" project after you've added sub-projects.

@{b}GST - Global Symbol Table (SAS/C)@{ub}

GST - is a precompiled headers file. PManager helps to manage SAS/C
"all.gst" file. Choose "Options", "Compiler Options..." in "GST" string
enter: "include:all.gst".

'Tools' menu options:

 - "Edit_AllGST" will open editor window with "all.c" file. You can add
    new headers to precompile (for example: #include <libraries/mui.h>).
 - "Make_AllGST" will compile "all.c" file to "include:all.gst".

You can use this global "include:all.gst" file for your projects,
instead locale GST files.

@{b}Adding Libraries and Objects (SAS/C)@{ub}

If you need to include link libraries(.lib) and objects(.o) to the
project, choose "Add Library(s)..." from 'Project' menu. In open
requester select files. Files will appear in the "Libraries" project
section.

ARexx port: PMANAGER.1

Commands:

WINDOWTOFRONT PROJECT_DIR/A      Bring project window to front.
MAKE_PROJECT  PROJECT_DIR/A      Make project.

These commands maybe useful to control PManager from text editor.

I've included "PManager.ged" file (for GoldED) in "PManager_Install/
config/editor/golded" directory. Usage example (from GoldED toolbar):
"GOLDED:arexx/PManager.ged MAKE_PROJECT" - make project which current
open file belongs to.
