Short:    Studio 16 Developer's Information
Uploader: dhomas@youngmonkey.ca <dhomas trenn>
Type:     dev/misc

This archive contains the original Sunrize 1.0 developer's files
(Studio16 v2.x) as well as the most recently found studio.fd file
(Studio16 v3.x).

For some unknown reason the first release of the studio.fd on aminet
(uploaded by someone else and which this archive replaces) seems to be
missing 11 functions.  Both versions of the studio.fd file are included
in this archive, just in case.

Also, see dev/misc/AD1012-Dev.lha for the original Sunrize AD1012
sound card developer documentation.
