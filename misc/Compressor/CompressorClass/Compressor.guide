@node introduction "Introduction"

  Hello users 8-)

    First I have to say that this piece of software the result of
    another project is. Because I think that this class is very useful
    I'm releasing it now to the public and I hope it will be used by
    some people. To show you why you should use this class, here is
    a little list with advantages:

       - No knowledge about XPK is needed.

       - Has an integrated gui for configuration
         (currently MUI, BGUI and GADTOOLS supported)

       - Multiple applications can use one interface
         for their XPK-Configuration.

       - (De)compression is very simple.

       - Localisation support.

    If you want to have something implemented then send me your
    suggestion. Perhaps it will be a feature of a coming version.

@endnode

@node todo " To do "

@node notes " Notes "

  READ ALL ! IT'S IMPORTANT !

  1. This class was written completely in Amiga-E. If your application
     is splitted up in multiple tasks, each task has to open the class
     itself.

  2. I've added C includes plus the translation of my demonstration
     program. I'm mentioning that because this is my first C program
     so it may be that it's not 100% perfect. The only difference
     to the E-Version is the fact that the demonstration of the
     method "CCM_FILES2FILES" is missing because I don't like C and
     I'm currently to tie to go on writing (tomorrow I must work again 8-(
     I will corrigize this in future, when I've got more time.
     The source was compiled with StormC v3.0 and runs correct 8->

  3. If you find any faults (spelling, programming or other type)
     then contact me to let me know what's wrong. This way my
     knowledge can grow and the next distribution will be more perfect.

@node macro_packsize " PACKSIZE() "

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

    size = PACKSIZE( originlen )

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This macro is used to calculate the memorysize needed to
    compress data of originlen length.

  @{b}NOTE@{ub}

    None.

@node macro_unpacksize " UNPACKSIZE() "

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

    size = UNPACKSIZE( originlen )

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This macro is used to calculate the memorysize needed to
    decompress data of originlen length.

  @{b}NOTE@{ub}

    The value originlen is NOT the length of the inputdata.
    It's the length of the inputdata when it's decompressed.
    To find out this length you can use the method @{" CCM_EXAMINE " LINK method_examine} .

@node macro_memsize " MEMSIZE() "

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

    size = MEMSIZE( mem )

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This macro returns the length of the memory area. The passed address of
    the memory must be allocated by the class otherwise it won't function
    correct.

  @{b}NOTE@{ub}

    This macro is used to be able to free the memory. If you are passing
    the address of the area to the exec's FreePooled() you have to reduce
    the address by 4 before.

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

    struct ccmExamine {
      ULONG  methodid;            // CCM_EXAMINE
      STRPTR com_Source;          // path of the source-file or NULL
      BYTE   *com_Memory;         // source-memory or NULL
      ULONG  com_MemoryLen;       // length of the source-memory or NULL
      ULONG  *com_SizeAddr;       // address to write the size to
    };

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This function gets the original length of a datastream or a file.
    This length is needed to calculate the size for decompression and
    will be stored to the address "com_SizeAddr" is pointing to.

  @{b}RESULT@{ub}

    If the method was successful FALSE will be returned, otherwise the
    value will be a XPK-Error as specified in "libraries/xpk.h" .

@endnode

@node method_file2file " CCM_FILE2FILE "

  @{b}NAME@{ub}

    CCM_FILE2FILE

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

      STRPTR com_Source;          // path of the source-file
      STRPTR com_Destination;     // path of the destination-file
      ULONG  com_Compressing;     // 0 = decompressing, otherwise compressing
    };

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This function (de)compresses a file to another file. You should be
    warned that the object doesn't check for an existing destination-
    file, so this file will be overwritten if it exists.

  @{b}RESULT@{ub}

    If the method was successful FALSE will be returned, otherwise the
    value will be a XPK-Error as specified in "libraries/xpk.h" .

@endnode

@node method_file2mem " CCM_FILE2MEM "

  @{b}NAME@{ub}

    CCM_FILE2MEM

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

    struct ccmFile2Mem {
      ULONG  methodid;            // CCM_FILE2MEM
      ULONG  com_Compressing;     // 0 = decompressing, otherwise compressing
      STRPTR com_Source;          // path of the source-file
      BYTE   *com_Memory;         // memory-area as destination
      ULONG  com_Length;          // length of the memory area
      ULONG  *com_OutLen;         // the length of the (de)compressed data will be stored here
    };

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This method will (de)compress a file to a memory area. If you
    want to know how much memory is needed for this operation then
    use the macros as defined in "classes/compressor.h".
    You must allocate the memory and pass it's address and it's length
    with this message. If you have set a memory-pool with @{" CCA_MEMPOOL " LINK tags_mempool}
    you don't need to allocate any mem. In this case you must set
    ".com_Length" to zero and the ".com_Memory" must be the address
    of a LONG. The method will allocate enough memory via the pool
    and then it will store the address in the LONG ".com_Memory" is
    pointing to. If you want to get the size of the memory area you
    must use the macro @{" MEMSIZE() " LINK macro_memsize} .

  @{b}RESULT@{ub}

    If the method was successful FALSE will be returned, otherwise the
    value will be a XPK-Error as specified in "libraries/xpk.h" .

@endnode

@node method_files2files " CCM_FILES2FILES "

  @{b}NAME@{ub}

    CCM_FILES2FILES

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

    struct ccmFile2Files {
      ULONG  methodid;            // CCM_FILES2FILES
      ULONG  com_Compressing;     // 0 = decompressing, otherwise compressing
      ULONG  *com_Sources;        // a NULL-terminated list with the name of the files to (de)compress
      ULONG  *com_Destinations;   // a NULL-terminated list with the name of the files to store
      ULONG  *com_Results;        // a NULL-terminated list which will be filled with the results
      STRPTR com_Suffix;          // if the destination-list doens't exist you can use a suffix which will be added (default = "xpk")
    };

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This method will (de)compress a list of files. If you are passing a
    destination-list, each file will be saved with the path of the
    corresponding element. The destination-list is optional, so if this
    component is set to NULL the (de)compressed files will be saved
    with this suffix (default = "xpk"). If the component "com_Results"
    exists it will contain the result for each file, so you can make
    a detailled error-report or leave it if this component is set to NULL.

  @{b}RESULT@{ub}

    The method returns the number of succesfully processed files, so if
    this number is smaller than the number of list-items, something went
    wrong.

@endnode

@node method_mem2mem " CCM_MEM2MEM "

  @{b}NAME@{ub}

    CCM_MEM2MEM

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

    struct ccmMem2Mem {
      ULONG  methodid;            // CCM_FILES2FILES
      ULONG  com_Compressing;     // 0 = decompressing, otherwise compressing
      BYTE   *com_Source;         // source memory
      BYTE   *com_Destination;    // destination memory
      ULONG  com_SourceLen;       // length of source memory
      ULONG  com_DestinationLen;  // length of destination memory
      ULONG  *com_OutLen;         // address of variable to store the size of written bytes
    };

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This method works like @{" CCM_FILE2MEM " LINK method_file2mem} with the difference that the
    source data is a memory-area. Except this there are no differences
    to the named method.

  @{b}RESULT@{ub}

    If this method is successful it will return FALSE otherwise an errorcode
    will be returned as specified in "libraries/xpk.h".

@endnode

@node method_prefsgui " CCM_PREFSGUI "

  @{b}NAME@{ub}

    CCM_PREFSGUI

  @{b}SYNOPSIS@{ub}

    struct ccmPrefsGUI {
      ULONG  methodid;            // CCM_PREFSGUI
    };

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

    This method will pop up a window, so the user can configure this
    object to his needs. If the button "Accept" will be pressed
    the current settings will be stored. If the button "Reject" or
    the window will be closed then the current settings will be
    lost (the settings before will be restored).

  @{b}RESULT@{ub}

    The method returns if it was successful, otherwise it will return
    TRUE.

  @{b}NOTE@{ub}

    When you are calling this method you should know that this method
    only returns when the user has closed the window. Until that your
    program will be stopped.

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

      With this tag you can get or set the configuration
      with the help of a data-chunk. This data has an
      internal format so you can't change this data by
      yourself. There is an IFF-ID available which should
      be used to store this chunk in the prefsfile of
      your own application. Since you are getting the
      original structure used by the object you are not
      allowed to write any data to it. Simply store or
      read this chunk and you won't have any problems.

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

      With this tag you can set or get the current selected
      mode of the current selected compression-method. The
      mode is a value between 1 and 100. The higher this
      value the better is the compression ratio. This isn't
      true for all methods because most of them aren't
      providing so many different modes. It depends on the
      method.

  @{b}FUNCTION@{ub}

      This is a very specific tag because you can pass a pointer
      returned by exec's "CreatePool()". If you are passing such
      a pointer the methods @{" CCM_FILE2MEM " LINK method_file2mem} and @{" CCM_MEM2MEM " LINK method_mem2mem} are
      having additional functionality. They will do the allocations
      for you if possible. The pool and all memory allocated by
      this class must be freed by you.
