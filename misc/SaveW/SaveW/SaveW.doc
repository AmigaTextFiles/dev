General Description:

SaveW is a little Cli-programm, which saves  the  settings  (LeftEdge,TopEdge,
Width and Height) of the current window to  a  file  or  alternatively  writes
them to the Cli-window.

Later this setting-file can be used  to  change  a  window  to  its  contents.

SaveW is a companion program to SizeW, which should  be  also  on  this  Disk.

SaveW saves the window-settings and SizeW sizes and moves the Window.

SaveW ist only useful if you`re also using SizeW.

System:

You need at minimum Kickstart 2.0 Version 37.xx .

Under Version 1.2 and 1.3 SaveW couldn`t run because of calling a  lot  a  new
library functions and features.


Legal Stuff:


        This  program  and  all files come with it, also the docfiles, are
        released as FREEWARE.

        this means:

            everybody may use SaveW,

            everybody may copy SaveW, if:

                1. You copy all included files, see list at the end of the
                   doc file.
                2. No changes are made,  this  means  the  program and all
                   included files must stay in the original form.
                   Exception: you  may  archieve  it; but in this case you
                              must also archieve the whole package.
                3. If  you  recompile  it, you have to include a notice to
                   the original author. If you also want to (re)distribute
                   in any new form you have to send me a copy.
                4. You may not sell SaveW.
                   Execption: you`re  allowed  to  take  a  small copy fee
                              which should not extend 5US$.
                5. If you want to include SaveW
                   or one of the  included files as a part of a commercial
                   package,  you  must  have  written  permission  of  the
                   author (address see below).


        I take no warranty or garanty for the function of this program.
        The whole risk of using SaveW stays only by the user.


Start Parameters:

SaveW can be called only from Cli and has the following SYNTAX:


SYNOPSIS:        SaveW [Config|INFO/S]

with:


        Config    String          for Config you  should  specify  a  filename
                                  in which the settings of the current  active
                                  window will be written.
                                  If you donot specify any configuration  file
                                  SaveW uses its default file:
                                  's:Window.config'.

                                  This is also the dafault file of  SizeW.  So
                                  you are enabled  to  use  SaveW  with  SizeW
                                  without the need to specify any  commandline
                                  parameter.

        INFO                      if you type INFO instead of  a  config  file
                                  SaveW writes the  settings  of  the  current
                                  active window in the Cli-window.
                                  So you are able to improve  different  sizes
                                  and   settings   before   saving   anything.


        If you specify Config and INFO the config file will be ignored.



Using SaveW:

The useful thing with SaveW and SizeW  is,  to  use  different  sizes  of  cli
windows without the need to type everytime the settings by yourown.
Therefor you can create some Aliases or write Batch-Scripts.

E.g.:
here is a Batch-Script that replaces the  Endcli  command.  Before  the  Shell
terminates the current window settings will be written  to  's:LastShell.cfg'.

( Therefor I assume, that this Batch-Script is placed in the s: Directory with
  the name 'End' and its S-Bit is set by typing 'Protect s:End +s'. )


_____________________________________________________________________________

    .key NONE             ; no Parameters

    SaveW s:LastShell.cfg ; save the window settings
    Wait 1                ; wait for the end of the write-request
    Endcli                ; closing the Shell-window

_____________________________________________________________________________

Now you should close a Shell always by calling 'End'.

Now you have to insert the following line to you s:shell-startup file:


    'SizeW F s:LstShell.cfg'


So you get each time you start a NewShell the  window  settigns  you  had  the
last time you finished a shell by calling End.


NOTICE:

       Bacause of saving always the current window settings, you  should  take
       care that only the Shell-window is the active one. Else the settings of
       another window will be saved.

       You can also use SaveW and SizeW to change settings from other  windows
       as cli-windows. But you should realize that there are some programs that
       react a little critical by trying to size their windows
       (that means GURU).

       Certainly SizeW only sizes windows that have a SizeGadget.


Last:

       I hope many people use SizeW and SaveW.

       If you find any bugs please let me know.

       Also serious critic and/or ideas are wellcomed.
