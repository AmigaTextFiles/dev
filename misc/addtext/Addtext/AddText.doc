   ***************************************************************** 

   Many times have I written text for programs or script files, and then
   had to add the printf, writeln or echo commands by hand.  I decided to
   automate the process and AddText was born!

   Example
   -------

   Let's say we have a text file called "Sheep.pme" which contains the
   following tortured prose...

        Little Bo Peep was a weird little girl

             Who's main love interest was ewe

        How extraordinary this small canary

        Which it's bound tutu
                           
   ...which we would like to have in a program or script file.  Selecting
   the Script option would produce a file which looks like...

        ; Courtesy of ADDTEXT - A N Peck (1995)
        
        echo ""
        echo "        Little Bo Peep was a weird little girl"
        echo ""
        echo "             Who's main love interest was ewe"
        echo ""
        echo "        How extraordinary this small canary"
        echo ""
        echo "        Which it's bound tutu"
        echo ""

   You could now execute this script file to produce the original text.

   The Pascal version would read...

        { Courtesy of ADDTEXT - A N Peck (1995) }
        
        Writeln ('');
        Writeln ('        Little Bo Peep was a weird little girl');
        Writeln ('');
        Writeln ('             Who''s main love interest was ewe');
        Writeln ('');
        Writeln ('        How extraordinary this small canary');
        Writeln ('');
        Writeln ('        Which it''s bound tutu');
        Writeln ('');

   Note that the extra apostrophes have been added.

   Finally the C option produces...

        /* Courtesy of ADDTEXT - A N Peck (1995) */
        
        Printf ("\n");
        Printf ("        Little Bo Peep was a weird little girl\n");
        Printf ("\n");
        Printf ("             Who's main love interest was ewe\n");
        Printf ("\n");
        Printf ("        How extraordinary this small canary\n");
        Printf ("\n");
        Printf ("        Which it's bound tutu\n");
        Printf ("\n");
        
   And that's all it does!  No washing of dishes or carrying out of dirty
   linen, but perhaps a bit easier to insert text into your next program or
   script file.

   The program was written in Assembly with help from Hextract (Chas A
   Wyndham), EdwordPro (Martin Reddy), PhxAss/PhxLnk (Frank Wille),
   Convbrush (David Kinder), Iconian (Chad Randall), DPaint (Electronic
   Arts), and some others I've forgotten.  The source is provided for your
   amusement.

   I hope you find this program useful.  I take no responsibility for it's
   actions but it is freeware!  Enjoy...
