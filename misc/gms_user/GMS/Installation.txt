This  step-by-step  installation is for people that don't have the AmigaDOS
Installer program, or if you like to install programs manually.

1. If you have an old version of GMS you may want to delete it to get
   rid of any old files.  The other option is to copy the new files over
   your old version.  If you are a new user, then simply copy GMS to a safe
   place on your hard-drive.

2. New users must assign GMS: to the main directory.  This is a standard
   assignment that *must* be available or else you will not be able to run
   anything.  To make it a permanent assignment, put it in your
   S:user-startup.

   Example:

     Assign GMS: HD1:System/GMS/

3. Reboot your amiga to make the GMS: assignment active, or open a shell
   and make the GMS: assignment if that suits you better.

4. Run GMS:Utils/GMSPrefs/GMSPrefs, setup the screen settings to suit your
   machine and save it as the default.  If you have OCS/ECS you must set the
   chipset option correctly, as the default is AGA which could crash these
   older machines.

To run the demos, just open a shell window, CD to the GMS:Demos/ directory
and execute them.  If they don't work, then there is either not enough
chip ram available, they can't find the GMS:  assign, or the data files
are missing. Most require some sort of joystick or mouse activity if you
are to see anything happen.

If you have any problems with the executables, the developers archive
contains IceBreaker, which can tell you what is going wrong.


              Demos support Left-Amiga + M screen switching.
