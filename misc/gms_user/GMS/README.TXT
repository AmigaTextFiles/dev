WELCOME to the GMS User archive.  This archive contains all the files you
need to run programs that use the Games Master System, and includes a number
of demos and utilities for you to use.  If you want to get the latest news
or list of programs using GMS, visit our web page at:

   http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~pmanias/

If you are interested in developing programs that use GMS, you will also
need to get the dev/misc/gms_dev.lha archive on Aminet.

You can either read the Installation.txt file to correctly install GMS, or
you can simply run the supplied installer script.  Once you have installed
GMS correctly, you MUST run the GMSPrefs program in the GMS:Utils/GMSPrefs/
directory, and check the settings are correct for your system.  Try
running one of the demos to check that GMS works, and everything should be
fine.

If you have a graphics card, DO NOT select the true colour modes.  You will
need a GMS graphics card driver first, which will be announced on the web
pages as they are developed.


User Registration
-----------------
In this archive there is a great program called GMSPrefs.  It allows you to
edit games to suit your liking, such as upgrading a screen to high
resolution, selecting XPK modes, C2P modules, and so on.  As you might guess
some of the functionality is crippled and you need to register to get full
use of this program.  Also, by registering you can ensure the future success
of the Games Master System on the Amiga.  All the money goes into making GMS
a better product for both developers and users, so your support is worth
something.

The registration fee is approximately $20US ($35NZ), for which you will be
sent a keyfile that unlocks the GMSPrefs program.  The keyfile is good for
TWO YEARS, and this will give you free access to all upgrades over that
period.

You can register online at the website, or print out the REGISTER.TXT file
and send it to:

  DW Productions
  8 Chanel Grove
  Lower Hutt
  NEW ZEALAND

Supply your name, address and e-mail details so that we can send back
the keys.  Payment by cash or credit card (Visa, Mastercard & Bankcard) is
accepted.


System Keys
-----------
Here are some useful key combinations to use when running GMS programs:

  Left-Amiga & M      : Switch to AmigaDOS.
  Left-Amiga & Delete : Instantly kill the running program.
