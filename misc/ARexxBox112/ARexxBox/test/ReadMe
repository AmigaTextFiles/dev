This directory contains the test code for arb/test.arb. The ARB generated
files are those beginning with rx_test, the main function is in test.c.

Demonstration: Run test. It should open a command shell where you can type
in commands for immediate execution. Try e.g. "help stem test." and watch
the result. You can use any of the listed commands.

I have supplied an external command as well.  Try "test foobar", this will
run the script "test.arbtest".

Close the command shell by giving an EOF (ctrl-\). Test will now call the
ARexx script "arbtest" with some parameters to demonstrate a) sending of
commands and b) the result hook mechanism.

After that, it will go into ARexx server mode.  Then you might want to do a
"rx testrx" which demonstrates all commands.

Test can be quit by ctrl-c.

Have a look at the source to see how easy it is to use an ARexxBox
generated ARexx interface! Have fun!
