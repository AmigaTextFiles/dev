USAGE

  makemake is a command line tool which creates a makefile for a
  user-specified list of source codes (the makefile is dumped to the
  console window but can be redirected into a makefile via normal output
  redirection). This tool is designed to be used with the C/C++ mode of
  GoldED. If you want to use it manually, here is the syntax:

  makemake <option> <option> ... FILES=<source code> <source code> ...

OPTIONS

  MF=MAKEFILE/K    name of the makemake output filename. default: makefile
  FILES/M          file(s) to check/parsing
  WITH/K           path of file that contains command line options
  SET/K            set the value of one or more variables in makefile (exp: SET "$var value $var2=val1 val2" )
  GET/K            return the value of the specified variable of makefile

  ALIAS=COMPILE/K  section name in the makemake.config used to create new makefile
                   or the name of the current compiler in GED format: compiler/compiler_target/compiler_version
  EXE=EXECUTABLE/K the path and name of output file (stored in: $(OUTDIR)+$(OUTFILE) )
  PREFIX/K         prefix for the object files (to collect o-files in a subfolder) - stored in $(OBJDIR)

  ASKFILE/S        show ASL-requester for select file(s) for checked
  ASKDIR/S         show ASL-requester for select dir(s) for checked
  PATTERN/K        pattern for ASL-requester (default "#?.(c|cc|cpp|c++)")
  MARGIN/N         recommended line width in makefile (default value is 100)
  NOVERBOSE/S      disable indicate progress
  DEPENDS/S        Looks recursively into local headers (pattern defined as DEFDEPENDS)
  DEFDEPENDS/K     define command name who is used to include file.
                   default: #include " " (defined as: #include *" *")
                   note: command_name init_string end_string (with one space beetween)
                   use: *" for '"' character, ** for '*' character
  DEFCOMMENT/K     define comment chars. default: // /* */ (// /** **/)
                   note: single_line multiline_start multiline_end (with one space beetween)

  *) This option uses MUI user interface.

EXAMPLES

  I. makefile for an compiler (vbcc in example)

  > makemake MODE vbcc SET="$(OUTFILE) test" FILES "main.c"

  This command line creates a makefile for the vbcc compiler suitable
  for compiling the source code "main.c" into the executable "test".
  For set executable name you can also use EXECUTABLE option. The
  makefile is designed to compile the source code directly into the
  executable without explicit creation of object files. Local
  includes (files directly included by "main.c") are considered as
  dependencies but other headers are not taken into account.
  This command line can be modified as follows:

  - add the DEPENDS option to consider dependencies on all local
  headers (makemake will follow all #include statements recursively). This
  is useful if you have a local header file which includes other local
  header files which include other local header files etc.

  - add the OBJECTS options to explicitely create (and keep) intermediate
  object files. If you use this option, you may want to combine it with
  PREFIX="o/" to collect the object files in the local "o/" folder. Keeping
  object files around reduces the time required for recompilation cycles.

  - you may want to use the INCLUDE option to indicate where the globals
  includes are located on your system.

  Before first use makefile - you can use MakePrefs tool to set the other
  compiler option (like output binary directory, compiler object files etc.)

  For update makefile you need just write:

  > makemake MODE vbcc ASKFILE

  (for this mode only file list will be overwrite, rest of makefile - with
  you own change - will be saved)

  II. makefile for the other tool (flexcat in example)

  > makemake MODE flexcat EXECUTABLE "test" ASKDIR

  This command line creates a makfile for flexcat tool. But before makemake
  ask user which directory's will be use to create build catalogs list.

  Note for default makefile settings:
  ----------------------------------
  1. EXECUTABLE (or EXE) opton must be given (or set manualy or by MakePrefs
  before first make use)
  2. Catalog Description (.cd) file must be placed in root directory (in the
  same as makefile)
  3. Catalog Translate (.ct) file must be placed in subdirectory. Output
  catalog file (.catalog) will be placed in (.ct) subdirectory.

  For update makefile you need just write:

  > makemake MODE flexcat ASKDIR
