NAME
    XRefAPI - GoldED API client for use with the xref.library to complete
              phrases

FUNCTION
    Just run GoldED and load this as an API-Client ! Then you have the
    following new ARexx command :

TEMPLATE
    XREFPHRASE CATEGORY/K,TYPES/K,MATCH/K,COMPLETEBEGIN/S,UPPERCASE/S,
               SPACE/S

FORMAT
    XREFPHRASE [CATEGORY <string|pattern>] [TYPES <to search for>]
               [MATCH matchmode] [COMPLETEBEGIN] [UPPERCASE] [SPACE]



FUNCTION
    the XREFPHRASE command tries to complete the current pharse (before 
    the cursor) with the entries from the xref.library. This is done by
    two algorithms :
        - First uppercase letter match :
            This means each character in the phrase must match the
            next uppercase letter in the name ! For example :
            the pharse "ow" matches "OpenWindow()" ("O"pen"W"indow())
        - Second begin match :
            The entry must match the beginning of the phrase !
    There is a automatic two switch between to algorithms :
        - if the pharse consists only of lower case letters the
          uppercase letter match algorithm is used !
        - if in the pharse is a uppercase letter the begin match
          algorithm is used !
    Note the matchmode RECURSIVE uses only the begin match algorithm !

INPUTS
    CATEGORY (STRING) - category string|pattern to search in

    TYPES (STRING) - types, which would only match ("function","struct",
        "function|struct" or so on)

    MATCH (STRING) - one of the following three matchmode strings 
        (default is FIRST) :
        FIRST - always get the first entry, which match the given pharse
        RECURSIVE - much like a Tab-Completion algorithm, it search for
            all entries matches the given phrase and complete it to the
            last character equal to all entries ! If you pass UPPERCASE
            argument the search is case-insenitive !
            If you pass the phrase you passed last and cannot be more
            completed, it switches to the SELECT matchmode and displays
            the window !
            This mode uses everytime the begin match algorithm !!!
        SELECT - it searchs for all entries matching the given phrase and
            if more than one is found, it opens a window you can select
            one !

    COMPLETEBEGIN (BOOLEAN) - use the begin match algorithm instead of
        uppercase letter match !

    UPPERCASE (BOOLEAN) - convert the phrase to upper

    SPACE (BOOLEAN) - if a name is found and inserted place a space behind

RESULTS
    the command returns RC_OK, if it could complete the pharse. RC_WARN
    if not !

EXAMPLE
    'XREFPHRASE CATEGORY #?AutoDoc TYPES "function"' :

    This command will parse all AutoDoc categories and compare the given
    shortcut with any function found in the xreffiles.For example the two
    letters "ow" will completed to "OpenWindow(", if you have the
    sys_autodoc.xref installed from the XRef-System package !
