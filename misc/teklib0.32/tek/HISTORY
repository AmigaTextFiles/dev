TEKLIB HISTORY
---------------------------------------

05-25-2001
- fixed X11 numeric keypad handling
- kernel and tekspace type definition for pens changed from TUINT to TVPEN
- kn/linux/visual/kn_drawrgb() now supports the X server running in
15, 16, and 24 bit, provided that there is no endian swapping involved
between client and server. implementation is still awful.
- kn/amiga/visual now opens a window with exactly the inner size as requested
- cleaned up a lot of the mess in kn/amiga/visual.c
- implemented kn/linux/visual/kn_freepen()
- improved most examples
- added kinematic demo from frank 'copper' pagels

05-07-2001
- started to fix/improve X keyboard mapping
- TSeekNode() was broken. oops!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.31 release
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

05-06-2001
- added MorphOS build
- slightly improved examples
- added doc/manuals/tasks
- typedef TNULL changed from (TAPTR) 0 to 0 for ANSI C++ compatibility

04-15-2001
- added preliminary X11 drawRGB function. currently very raw and primitive,
and only working on 24bit displays.
- added TVGetAttrs and several TVisual attributes which can be queried and
passed to TCreateVisual().

04-14-2001
- elate input handling improved

04-10-2001
- fixed amiga kn_getsize()
- TCreateVisual(): visual task swallowed input events under high load. fixed.
- changed TAttachVisual() freeing of drawmsgs
- fixed TMMUGetSize() for TMMUT_Message

04-09-2001
- added kn_resettimer()
- added #define TEKLIB_PTHREADS_FLAW for workaround for
possible race condition in linux pthreads
- added AmigaOS cross compiler build with gcc

04-07-2001
- added TSendMsg()

04-03-2001
- improved debug headers, fixed elate debugging
- updated README, INSTALL

04-02-2001
- changed select timeout in kn/elate/sock.h

03-29-2001
- swapped meanings of TVFlush() and TVSync(), renamed
kn_sync() to kn_flush
- added TVFlushArea()
- added right mousebutton detection under elate, which
was unexpectedly difficult and is still not fully working:
while a mousebutton is held, another one isn't detected yet.

03-19-2001
- Elate port of visuals is now working

03-16-2001
- added TGetMsgStatus() and TGetMsgSender() as seperate functions/macros.
TGetMsgAttrs() alone is a bit unconvenient most of the time.
- added socket includes in type_amiga.h

03-15-2001
- re-implemented visuals. kernelspace implementations are currently
working on the posix and amiga ports.
- added TTaskAllocHande() and TTaskAllocHandle0() macros.

03-11-2001
- fixed kn/amiga/exec.c/timedwaitevent(). WaitIO() does not always clear
a timerequest's mp_sigbit from the task's set of signals for timer IO.
that caused the task to be constantly retriggered. the signal bit is
now removed from the task's signal mask after processing the request.
- added HISTORY
