 INTRODUCTION

Developing  a  multidirectional  scrolling  game  you  need  a  map-editor.
Currently  I did'nt found any good map-editor for the Amiga, except the old
Freditor by Chris Leathley.  Unfortunately this utility isn't multitasking,
it isn't 100% AGA compatible, and it doesn't support 256 colors maps.

If you are developing a multidirectional arcade game, you need MapEd by
Fabrizio Farenga!

If you'll use MapEd to create a commercial (or PD) game, I'll be happy if
you'll send me a free copy of your product.
If possible please insert my name in the credits screen. :-)

 INSTALLATION

MapEd requires at least OS 2.04 to run.  1Mb of Chip-RAM is strongly
recommended...  Video-Cards (like Picasso II) are not supported.

Please   install  iff.library  (by  Christian  A.   Weber)  in  your  libs:
directory. Iff.library 23.2 is provided in the MapEd archive.

Double-clik on the MapEd icon to start the program.

 HOW TO USE MAPED

To use MapEd is very simple:
just load a blocks file (IFF 320x208), size your map and draw it!

- To move throught the blocks use the standard directional arrows.
- To move throught the map (1 block at time) use the numeric keypad
  directional arrows.

- To move horizontally throught the map (1 page at time) press the SHIFT
key and use the numeric keypad directional arrows.

- To go to the upper right edge of the map, press the key "9" (keypad).
- To go to the upper  left edge of the map, press the key "7" (keypad).
- To go to the lower right edge of the map, press the key "3" (keypad).
- To go to the lower  left edge of the map, press the key "1" (keypad).

- To print a block use the SPACE BAR key.

- To "query" the selected map block, press the key "5" of the numeric keypad.

- You can use the mouse to move through the page and the left mouse button
to print a block. Right mouse button actives the menu.


The IFF blocks files and the map files are "Freditor" compatible.



The Menu:

Project/Open Map    - Open a map file.
Project/Open Blocks - Open a IFF blocks file.
Project/Save Map    - Save a map file.
Project/Save Preview- Save a @{"Preview" Link "PREVIEW"} IFF file.
Project/Resize      - Set the new map size.
Project/About       - Read the copyright notices.
Project/Quit        - Quit the program.


NOTE:
Starting with MapEd 1.3, modifying the IFF Blocks file currently loaded,
with a multitasking tool (e.g.  DPaint V), the file will be auto-reloaded
in MapEd. This is done using the "notify" feature of AmigaDOS 2.04 (or
higher), and doesn't work an all file systems (e.g. Parnet doesn't support
"notifying").

A600 USERS

If you own a little Amiga 600, you know your computer does'nt have the
numeric keypad. This is indispensable to use MapEd. So please use the
keypad emulator (KPatch) by Fabrizio Farenga available on the Aminet
archive.

NTSC USERS

If you are an NTSC Amiga user, I'm sorry, but currently you can't open
Maped in 640x200 (NTSC or DPLNTSC).
MapEd require a 640x256 display (PAL or DPLPAL).

I'll try to add a ScreenMode-Requester in the next version.

@Node "MAPFILE" "MAPED.guide/MAPFILE"

 THE MAP FILES

The MAP format is pretty simple:

4 Bytes - header "MAP " (hex: $4D415020)
1 Word  - width in blocks
1 Word  - height in blocks
x bytes - blocks definitions (x = height * blocks).

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!



NOTE: This format is the same used by the Freditor, so you can import any
      old Freditor's map file.

WARNING:  MapEd can handle bigger maps than Freditor, so using Freditor
          DON'T import maps greater than 256x256 blocks (created with
          MapEd)...

 PREVIEWING MAPS

Starting with MapEd 1.5 it is possible to generate map previews.  Using the
menu option "Save Preview..." MapEd builds a preview IFF image and asks to
you the file name to save it.
The preview file is a full rendered map (scale 1:4).  Each 16x16 block is
reduced to a 4x4 block.  The # of bitplanes will be mantained.

@Toc "Main"

 KNOWN BUGS

- This is not really a bug... This is an Amiga DOS "notify" feature:
  due to some technical reasons, when MapEd detect that the Blocks File
  has changed, it try to re-load it.  If it is corrupted, wrong, or it
  doesn't exists anymore, no error messages can be displayed...  I'll try
  to fix this in next MapEd versions...


I think there are so many other bugs that this page would not be enough...
:-)

Remember:
- No many checks are performed!
- PLEASE Don't run MapEd on 1.3 (or lower) systems!

 FUTURE PLANS

There are several features I would like to include in future versions of
MapEd such as:

- ScreenMode-Requester
- Config file
- Video-Card support.
- Many other features...

 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

I  would like to thank the following people for doing the Beta testing
and providing me with ideas:

Roberto Campus
Stefan Schulz
Alfredo Siragusa

I also want to thank all those people who sent me mail with wishes and
bug reports. Without them MapEd wouldn't work as well as it does.
