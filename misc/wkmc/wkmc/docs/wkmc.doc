1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 WKMC is a fast truecolor-emulation for 8-bit displays. The idea
 came from Stefan Kost's "Multicolor"-system. Because this program
 changes the pixel-aspect and is terribly slow I decided to write my own.
 (I started a Paint-program and tried out some dither-methods.
  Result: The simplest method was the best one.)

 Advantages:
  -pixel-aspect and image-size are not changed
  -high speed
  -more visible colors:
    -every color-channel (RGB) has a diffent number of shades ("eye-sensitive")
    -all 256 color-registers are used
  -no flickering (uses Multiscan)
  -rgb-values are in the usual range 0..255 (not 0.0..1.0)

 Because the rows are created using a more or less tricky
 algorithm and copied into the bitmap directly you can't use
 WKMC on gfx-board's.


2. Examples
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Three examples are supplied:

 *   plasma: algorithm taken from Stefan Kost's archieve (needs 68030+/FPU)
             Example:
              plasma 32 (resolution 320x240)
              ->29 seconds

 *  ppmview: very fast ppm-viewer (needs 68030+)
             Example:
              image: 465x768,  size: 1071375, processor: M68030 40Mhz
               ->5 seconds

 * jpegview: very fast jpeg-viewer (needs 68030+) (no source-code supplied)
             Example:
              image: 704x1002,  size: 176880, processor: M68030 40Mhz
              ->16 seconds

             This program supports the new progressive-format - but
             only color-jpeg's are displayed correctly.

             jpegview uses some libjpeg-code created by the
             Independent JPEG Group.


3. Suggestions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because this program only uses trivial algorithms it's pure FREEWARE.
 But I'm interested in receiving mc-related suggestions or programs.

 How about a mpeg-player using this technique ?
