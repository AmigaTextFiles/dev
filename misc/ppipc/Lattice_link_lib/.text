        In this directory is the Linkable Library module
        (BLINK compatible) containing Resident Library call
        stubs for versions of Lattice (prior to 4.0) that
        cannot use the direct-call pragmas in IPC_proto.h.

        Included are the library module itself (IPC.lib)
        and the assembly sources required to generate it.
        (The component objects are also included.)
