        This directory contains Assembly sources (minor
        modifications of those in Lattice_link_lib/SOURCE)
        that should be suitable for creating linkage stubs
        for accessing the IPC Shared Library under Manx/Aztec.
        There is also a library object file created under
        Manx 3.4.

   [There are no Tools or projects here accessible by icon
   -- use the CLI to access the text files in this directory.]
