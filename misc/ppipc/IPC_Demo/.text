This demo couples a hopefully useful server with a totally useless client...
"FormatServer" accepts numeric and string data plus formatting specifiers
in a message and generates a formatted string.  "FormatClient" sends it
some trivial data for formatting.

Type return in the "Command" (client) window: Formatserver shows the message.
Precede the return with "f" to get the string back to the Client output.
Precede the return with "m" to get the string back via the reply message.

To understand WHY it wants to do these things, see the documentation...
To exit the demo, type cntrl-\ (End-of-file).
