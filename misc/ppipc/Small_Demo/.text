This is a very simple demo where a Client sends a message containing text
items to a Server, which prints them in its window.

Type a line in the "Command" (client) window: Simpleserver shows the message
(prefixed by an identifying string -- also supplied by the client, as a
separate item).

To exit the demo, type cntrl-\ (End-of-file).
