        This is a directory containing a copy of the IPC
        library module (ppipc.library), which you should
        install in LIBS: for running IPC (see Install_Library),
        and the linkage routine module for Lattice (IPC.lib).
        [I believe that the latter will work with any revision
        of Lattice C, but for version 4.0 or later, it is
        preferable to include IPC_proto.h in your source
        (to make the linkages directly).]
