    This Icon installs the "ppipc.library" module
    in your system LIBS: directory.  This must be
    done before the demo Icon (or any other program
    using IPC) can be run.

    The library occupies about 2600 bytes on your
    system disk (under 2000 when loaded into memory).

    If you do NOT want to install the library now,
    click in the Close gadget above.  To install the
    library, click below.
