This directory contains all the Include files that might be needed for
normal use of the IPC library.

    IPC.h           -- definitions of all normally-needed IPC structures
                    and flags; should be included in all modules that use
                    IPC.  It is fairly heavily internally commented.

    IPC_proto.h     -- direct library call definitions for Lattice 4.0
                    or higher. (Avoids needing to link with IPC.lib)
                    Use together with IPC.h.

    IPCPorts.h      -- definition of Port structure; this should NOT be
                    needed for normal IPC usage.  If used, include IPC.h
                    first.

    IPC_lib.i       -- IPC Library Offsets for Assembly level library calls.

    IPC_lib.fd      -- standard Library Function Descriptor File (used to
                    generate IPC_proto.h).
