# This file should contain a list of port names and the corresponding
# commands required to activate them, like:

"Print_Format" run IPCC:FormatServer >CON:0/0/639/80/FormatServer:

# note the format of valid lines -- port name in quotes, followed by
# the command in quotes.  (In the current system, ANY line not beginning
# with a quote is skipped.)
# Note also that COMPLETE pathnames are required (to satisfy "Execute()").
# (It is suggested that an assigned device be used -- as here (assigned
# by the Xicon script in this case).
