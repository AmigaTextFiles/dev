@{MS "Introduction"}

SnoopRouter is a tool that is required when creating drivers for hardware that is currently only
supported by PC, MAC or other systems.@{par}

By using SnoopRouter its possible to get an serial protocol within seconds and your job is only to
write the driver by using this log file.@{par}

An example: It took about 4 to 5 hours to get the full serial protocol of the DexDrive for my
@{"MCControl" link "OtherPrgs"}! By using SnoopRouter this took only 30 Seconds. (Booting windows
not included)@{par}

Mice, Graphic tablets, cameras, mobiles, calculators, satellite receivers, or what ever is out
there. Serial hardware is loosing all its transfer secrets within seconds.@{par}

The idea and the creation of this software came on the Amclust party 1/2000! Someone required an
Driver for his digital camera and Mice said: "Guido, do it!". By using the mental and helpful
support of Hulk and the consume of coke and the chocolate bars we created this universal serial
snoop software, which also allows to scan XPRZ-Transfers and/or to connect systems with different
baud rates!

@endnode
@node "Systemrequirements" "Systemrequirements"

@{MS "System requirements"}

SnoopRouter (should work) works on all Amigas with OS 2.0 or higher! Also required are two serial
ports and an null modem cable.@{par}

In addition its required to have at least one device to snoop and an computer/other device that is
able to communicate with this device.@{par}

That`s all!

This program should be published on every public medium, as long as all files in the archive are
unchanged. If this medium is a CD I expect a free copy. (AminetCDs excluded)@{par}

@{b}SnoopRouter is Mailware.@{ub}@{par}

I expect from everybody, who uses SnoopRouter regularly, to send me an email or postcard. I think
this does not hurt anybody, and I will have more fun to integrate new features.@{par}

@{b}I am not liable for injures or data loss caused by SnoopRouter! The use of SnoopRouter is on

@{MS "Other programs!"}
@{MS "BoulderDäsh        [game/jump/boulderdaesh.lha]"}

Clone of the original Boulderdäsh for Amiga. It is the only version running faster on Amiga than the
original. It looks and behaves like the original. I was asked, where the C64 is. (-8 And all this on
a 68000 without Fastmem.

@{MS "SimpleCat          [dev/misc/simplecat.lha]"}

This tool is for programmers and user. Using this program you can change catalogs of programs with
your favourite text editor in the easiest way. These programs must include a CS file. Search for it
in the archive of the catalogs drawer.

@{MS "Afind              [util/misc/afind.lha]"}

With this program you can search for programs on your Aminet CDs in the easiest way. It is the same
than the original tool on the CD, but here you can use AminetCDs and AminetSets mixed. So you are
not forced to search for a program on the first 5 Aminet CDs, that is on AminetSet1 Disk b.

@{MS "AView              [util/misc/aview.lha]"}

AView is a great multiview enhancement/replacement! It is working like Multiview, but you are able
to specify a special viewer/player for each file type.

@{MS "Guideformat        [text/edit/guideformat.lha]"}

GuideFormat is a simple tool. It is easy to format text blocks, even if there are "links" or other
guide commands in.

@{MS "GuideCheck         [text/edit/guidecheck.lha]"}

GuideCheck ist ein Tool, das es erlaubt ein Guidefile vollständig zu prüfen und alle eventuellen
Fehler aufzudecken.

@{MS "SiedlerBoot        [game/patch/siedlerboot.lha]"}

This allows to start the Settlers direct via CD and save the scores on HD. There is no hard disk
install required. SiedlerBoot requires the "Amiga Plus Sonderheft 9" cover CDROM.

@{MS "Execute64          [misc/emu/execute64.lha]"}

Execute64 allows to transfer file direct into the C64 and to start them. This allows to play games
an use the Amiga a big file server.

@{MS "R                  [util/cli/r.lha]"}

"R" creates a GUI for each DOS Programm. This allows you to use DOS commands even if you aren´t very
good in reading templates.

@{MS "DVBControl         [comm/misc/dvbcontrol.lha]"}

DVBControl is a software project for the Nokia MediaMaster (D-Box) and DVB2000 firmware. It allows
to update firmware, edit channel settings and much more. So if you are using DVB2000 and an Amiga
DVBcontrol is your only choise!

@{MS "MCControl          [hard/hack/mccontrol.lha]"}

MCControl (MemoryCard Control) is a card reader for Playstation MemoryCards. It requires a little
selfmade hardware (~$5) and the free software!

@{MS "VBRControl         [util/sys/vbrcontrol.lha]"}

VBRControl moves the processor vector base to fastram. This is increasing system speed.

@{MS "AvailCPU           [util/sys/availcpu.lha]"}

AvailCPU is a little program that shows the CPU usage by using the PowerLED!

@{MS "TrackDisplayClock  [util/time/trackdisplaycl.lha]"}

A hardware track display is very useful, if you need it! The most time this type of hardware is only
good for lighting up the room! This will be changed when using TrackDisplayClock! TrackDisplayClock
displays the system time on your track display! Its cool, its useful and of cource the time is
always in visual range. Delete all programs using screens, windows or icons to display the time and
of course don´t forget to remove your noclick tool! TrackDisplayClock is doing all these jobs and
your system will be faster than before! (-8

@{MS "SnoopRouter"}

I use a little example to explain the usage of SnoopRouter. "SLAVE" is the hardware you want
to create an amiga driver for. "MASTER" is the system you that supports the "SLAVE"!@{par}

If your mobile is working with an PC, then "SLAVE" is your Handy and "MASTER" is your PC!@{par}

Connect SLAVE to your Amiga and use the same cable that is normaly used to connect it with the
MASTER! Now connect MASTER to your Amiga by using a null modem cable. This should look like
@{"this" link "/Data/Connect.ilbm/MAIN"}!@{par}

Now start SnoopRouter on Amiga by using the following template:

MASTERDEVICE=MD,MASTERUNIT=MU/N,MASTERBAUD=MB/N,SLAVEDEVICE=SD,SLAVEUNIT=SU/N,SLAVEBAUD=SB/N,DELAY/N,TO:@{par}

It look a bit komplex, but its easy to use. Its just the setup for two different serial devices for
Master and Slave! You must specify the ports MASTER and SLAVE are connected to. SnoopRouter virtualy
connects these ports, so you can control your SLAVE by using the MASTER like there are connected
direct. The only difference is that SnoopRouter is logging each transfered byte.@{par}

Examples:@{par}

SnoopRouter@{par}

Is opening the "serial.devive", unit 0 with 38400 baud as MASTER and the same device but unit 1 as
SLAVE! The logfile will written direct into the shell window.@{par}

SnoopRouter hyperCOM30Z.device to t:Camera.logfile@{par}

Here the device "hyperCOM30Z.device" unit 0 will be connected with the "hyperCOM30Z.device" unit 1!
Both sides are working with 38400! The logfile will be writen into "t:Camera.logfile"!@{par}

SnoopRouter hyperCOM30Z.device 0 57600 serial.device 0 38400@{par}

All data from HyperCOM (hyperCOM30Z.device, 57600 Baud, Unit 0) will be send by using the Amiga
internal serial port (serial.device, 38400 Baud, Unit 0) and vice versa! The logfile will be printed
on screen!@{par}

@node "SnoopProtocol" "SnoopRouter - The Protocol"

@{MS "The Protocol"}

The protocol is very easy!@{par}

Each block begins with a direction index:@{par}

MAST - Master-Device sent data@{par}
SLAV - Slave-Device sent data@{par}
CONT - Continues last data message@{par}

Followed by a size ID and a four byte size indicator:@{par}

SIZExxxx@{par}

Now the data ID followed by 0x3A0A (":" and Linefeed) and xxxx bytes of data:@{par}

DATA(y*xxxx)@{par}

Take a look into the example: @{"DexDrive.log" link "/Data/DexDrive.log.hex/MAIN"} (Hex output done
with the AmigaDos type commmand)@{par}
