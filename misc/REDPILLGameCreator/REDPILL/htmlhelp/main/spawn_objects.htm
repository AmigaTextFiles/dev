It is always more optimal to have a tile instead of an Object, but for moving
entities there is no other way than having a Game Object.

The first step would be to have an Object that is not static, an item or an 
enemy for example.

Then there are several ways to achieve the spawn, the best one would be to
use a tile in order to do it. Every time the scroll reaches a tile of that 
type it will spawn an object. You can set this up in the Tile Properpies 
screen inside Tiles section. The object will only be alive and processed after
reaching the part of the level where the tile exist.

In the tile properties, if you activate the checkbox when the screen is 
created for the first time, if the tile exists in the visible area it will
also create the object.

The second way is more flexible but less optimal, just go to the Level screen
and on the bottom right you can add a non static object to the level, then 
just change the position of the new object to the desired position in the 
level. By default the object will be processed once the level is reached, if
you want another behaviour go to the object, and in the advanced section you
can select Awake on screen to specify you want it to become alive only when
it appears in the screen for the first time.
