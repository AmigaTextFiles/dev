 The only utility you'll ever need to fix Xmodem transmitted files. If
 the file is an executable program, and your Amiga tells you it is
 'Not an object module', it has probably been padded beyoud it's normal
 file length by Xmpdem padding during Xmodem transmission. This utility
 fixes that for you. Note that you do NOT have to know the file length.
 Text files, archives, and pictures do not need this, just executable
 programs.

        USAGE: hunkpad <filename>
