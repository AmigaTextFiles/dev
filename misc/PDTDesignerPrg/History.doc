TheDesigner - History.doc                              (C)1993-98 P.D.Turner.

The following is the history of "The Designer".  It details all revisions and
releases of the program.


V1.0            Unreleased
----
The original, written at hardware level.  Major design faults rendered the
program almost unusable.


V1.1            Unreleased
----
Attempted to improve original design.  Still written at hardware level.
This time, problems with the file system corrupts disks.  The Program
however is much better!


V1.2           Unreleased
----
Added a lot to the design to make the program system friendly.  The program
works to spec.  But... Map redraws are very slow.  The program is driven with
gadgets only, and this made the program very difficult to use.


V2.0           Unreleased
----
Scrapped original design completely.  Re-wrote whole design to be much more
user-friendly.  One major target was to make the program look and feel much
more professional, which I did!

Some of the added features for Version 2:


   * On-screen editing, rather than "Remote-control" editing with gadgets!

   * Ability to select tiles by pointing and clicking.

   * File requester.

   * Block commands.  (A bit rough at this stage!)

   * Allowed greater choice of tile size.

   * Ability to save tiles out as IFF or RAW data.

   * Ability to save maps as RAW data.

   * Added "Fast-mover" gadget.  Allows instant placing of editing window.


V2.01           Unreleased
-----
No more design changes now, just updates!
Changed a few areas of the program to acheive the following...

   * Added "Busy" pointer and "Busy" state.  In V2.0 while the program was
     busy doing something, the computer was still collecting inputs from
     the user.

   * Improved menu handling code.

   * Improved calculations used for the "Fast-mover" gadget.

   * IFF routines changed to handle colour maps of different sizes.

   * Fixed a bug in the File requester - If the current dir was changed, the
     directory was read, but you couldn't load or save anything.

   * Removed "Next Tile" and "Provious Tile" from the menus and implemented
     them as keyboard only commands.

   * Made various functions refresh the display properly when new data is
     loaded.


V2.10           First release, as shareware.  May 1993
-----
Made the following changes to the program...

   * Re-wrote file requester.  File list now sorted.  User able to operate
     gadgets while the directory is being read.

   * Added a palette requester.

   * When changing tile size, check with user first.  If tile size is changed
     the whole map is checked, if any tiles values are found to be too high
     they are changed.

   * Re-wrote block selection code.  Now uses an "elastic-box", rather than
     the dodgy "click on two corners" approach!

   * Added an option to allow user to paint with tile, rather than needing to
     place each tile individually.

   * Re-wrote code that handles mouse movements to be faster.

   * Re-wrote map draw routine to be faster.

   * Added ability to increase and decrease map in any direction.

   * Added a filled box command.

   * Added a tidy custom requester to replace the OS AutoRequest();

   * Re-wrote failure routines to give more detail about what went wrong,
     rather than just saying - "Failed!"

   * Added argument handling and WBench startup.

   * Added option to create an icon for maps.

   * Added user control of WBench screen.

   * Removed "Include Tiles?" requester when saving, and replaced it with an
     option on the prefs menu.

   * Made program recognise PAL and NTSC televisions and adjust screen size
     accordingly.  This is much better than distributing two versions.


Plus I found and fixed the following bugs!...

   * When selecting a block, the menus remained active.  If the user selected
     a menu option everything went wrong!   Fixed!

   * When the map was smaller than the screen, the "Fast-mover" gadget failed
     to set the x co-ordinate properly.   Fixed!

   * If the mouse was in the editing window and all data was cleared using
     the keyboard short-cut, and then you move the mouse... CRASH!!!
     Fixed!

   * Various commands used dbra loops.  When using very large maps or blocks
     the commands failed because dbra operates on WORDs only.   Fixed!

   * When clearing data not all the default values were restored.   Fixed!

   * If you changed the size of a large map to smaller than one screen, the
     display was not re-drawn correctly.   Fixed!


V2.11           Unreleased
-----
Just a few of bug fixes and enhancements...

Bugs...

   * When loading an IFF with a mask (DPaint stencil etc), the loader was
     supposed to discard the mask plane.  Instead it included it as part of
     the image.   Fixed!

   * The palette requester used the default font.  This was fine if you boot
     in 80 column mode.  In 60 column mode the gadget text was all over the
     place!   Fixed!


Enhancements...

   * Changed file requester so it ignored the icon ".info" files, as this
     looked very untidy.

   * Included this file on the public disk.

   * Added 2nd example file.  Made sure that all other example maps had their
     tiles saved as part of the map.

   * Had instruction manual re-written.


V2.12           Released, January 1994.
-----
Re-wrote code which handled keyboard short-cuts because it relied on RAW key
codes.  RAW key codes relate to position rather than what is printed on top 
of the keys.

This meant that in certain countries the keyboard short-cuts were different.

This has now been fixed so that all counties use the same keys.  Don't forget
that for this to work you will have to install the keymap for your country in
the startup-sequence.

I have also extended the short-cuts to include functions added after the
original V2.0 update.

Note: I have tried as far as possible to keep the short cuts the same, there
is only one change this is the "Get Tiles Block" which has changed from "P"
to "B".  Note also that the case of the keys is now important, this enabled
me to put more than one function on one key.

In a future release I may decide to change more short-cuts to make them more
"Obvious".  This will also happen if I add a significant number of new 
functions.


V2.13           Released, Febuary 1994.
-----
I don't know!!  The new documentation had a couple of omissions,  the page
numbers in the contents for chapter seven somehow escaped!  Also, the listing
of the disk contents was incomplete.

I have also added the following...

   * When you are selecting a map block, the tile number is replaced with the
     word "BLOCK", and the size is replaced with "GRAB".

   * When in filled box mode, the tile number is replaced with the word 
     "BLOCK", and the size is replaced with "FILL".


I have done the above to save people getting confused when they select one of
these modes and nothing appears to happen.


I also found and fixed the following bugs...


   * If you changed the size of a large map to smaller than one screen, the
     display was not re-drawn correctly.  I thought that this bug had been
     fixed in V2.10, but it came up again.  It is now definitely fixed.

   * If you changed the size of a large map to smaller than one screen, the
     editing window was not relocated properly.  This left the editing
     window somewhere in the middle of nowhere!   Fixed!

   * If you had a map smaller than one screen, it was possible to move the
     cursor around in the blank area that was not part of the map.
     The program had built in protection so that it was impossible to place
     tiles outside the map, but when selecting a block or area to fill, it
     was possible to select this blank area.
     It is now impossible to move the cursor out of the map.

   * The calculations for the "Fast-mover" gadget were always slightly wrong.
     They are now correct.


I have now decided to offer people the source code for The Designer.  More
details on how to obtain this are contained in the "Read_Me_First" file, and
are repeated as part of the "About" text in the program.


V2.14           Released as full version only.  (No PD version).  April 1994.
-----
This release is only for people buying the full version, ie. there is no
cut-down V2.14 in the public domain.

Immediately after sending off V2.13 I discovered the following small bugs...

   * Amiga hardware (before AGA) cannot open a high resolution display using
     more than 16 colours.  The Designer still gave the option to use a high
     resolution screen even when there were 32 colours, this resulted in a
     blank screen (OS1.3) or a dodgy looking 16 colour one (OS2+).

     Now when you have more than 16 colours, the hi-res menu option is
     disbaled.

   * It was possible to select a tile size larger than the actual tile page.
     (eg if you had only a few tiles and the page was 16 pixels high you were
     able to select a tile size 32 pixels high).
     
     Now invalid tile sizes are disbaled.

   * If you had a tiles page larger than one screen and you wanted to select
     a block of tiles from an area outside the first screen, the cursor would
     not move into these areas.   FIXED!!!

   * The cursor was always drawn one pixel too big in each dimension.
     FIXED!!!


V2.15a           Full product release via Aminet.        July 1998
------
The full version, available through aminet and licensees only.

Updated the status graphics, I thought the originals had dated too much in
four years, it now has an OS2> look to it.

Also uploaded public source disk for version 2.14 to aminet.


Additional Notes
----------------
Under Kickstart 2+, you are able to drag screens using a key as well as
the mouse, since I designed the program before I knew this, it is possible to
mess up the display...

Under Kickstart 2+, the screen depth arangements are handled differently, so
if you press the Left-Amiga N combination to get to the Workbench screen you
need to press it twice.  Or only half of The Designers display gets moved.

The above two points are not bugs in the program, but are caused by small
differences in Kickstarts.  Since I was using V1.3 when I designed the
program and also for most of the time I was writing it, I was not aware of
these problems until it was too late.  I apologise if this causes anyone any
inconvenience.
