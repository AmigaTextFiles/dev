This archive supports you with easy to use
assembly language functions to support EGS
and/or CyberGraphX Boards in game/demo stuff.
This can be considered as some sort of a preview
for rtgmaster.library (even if this is no library),
as the code is MAINLY compatible to the later to be
released library. (But you have to do more things
yourself with this code, it is intended for people
who can't wait, but have to release a game/demo
soon...)

This stuff is mainly ripped out of the source code
of rtgEGS.library and rtgCGX.library on which i am
working.
