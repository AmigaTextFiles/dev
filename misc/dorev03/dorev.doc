                   ---------------------------------
                  

1. Why ?

I've seen many times those nice sources headers built automatically, and so
I searched some programs that made them, but none was what I wanted.
So I begun programming this little utility for programmers and in two
days I finished it. I hope you would like it...

2. How it works ?

In the header that it creates, there's two parts :
The Generic part and the History part.
The Generic part contents are as follows :

 Name          : The name of the program (module).
 Copyright     : (optional) The copyright.
 Creation Date : When the program (module) was first created.
 Translator    : (optional) The compiler that the programmer use.
 Compiler opts.: (optional) The options to compile the program (module).
 
The History part is formed of variable number of lines with :

 Date          : When the revision was made.
 Rev           : The revision number.
 Author        : The author of the revision.
 Comment       : Should be clear :-)
 
3. How to use it.

All is controlled by the commandline, type in the CLI "DoRev ?" and all should
be clear.
DoRev watch before the commandline and then the source file.
You can for example do not specify the copyright : If DoRev finds a copyright
in the source file, it will repeat the source's copyright. But if it doesn't find
the copyright neither in the source, the copyright line wouldn't be generated.
Another feature of DoRev is that some text may be specified in env-variables :
Copyright, Translator, CompilerOpts, Author : Are env-varables that can be
set with the "SetEnv" command. This is very useful : for example you can
save your copyright (store the env-variable in ENVARC:) and you haven't
to write it every time you make a new header. To make DoRev ignore the env-variables, 
set the NOENV switch in the commandline.

4. Greetings...

I would like to thank especially the "Amiga Club Ticino" and it's
"Programmatori Amiga Ticino" with all the members of this neat group.
