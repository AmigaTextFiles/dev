Since Flexy 1.4 use other settings inside .config file. The old one is not
compliant with it.
Flexy should handle correctly and propose you to replace (overwrite) the
old one by a new one. Anyway, in case of problem (no start, launch and
quit in a couple of seconds, ...) then I suggest you to delete the old
Flexy.config (normaly in `S:') manualy and try again.

Feedbacks are welcome.
Enjoy...
