@NODE Droits Copyrights

Flexy is under copyright of its author. It MUST NOT be modified neither sold!

Flexy is e-mailWare, only for I can know if people use it and if it is
usefull than I continue to update it.

Exept this, Flexy is free to use and free to release. :-)

In all distributions, " Flexy ", must keep its full joined
package (documentation and sign file (Flexy.sig)).

@{B}WARNING@{UB} : The author can't be responsible for any damage or loss
due to the use of Flexy. Use it at your own risks!
Stop here the paranoia protocol. ;-)

FlexCat is copyright Marcin Orlowski. See Flexcat documentation.
Flexy is copyright Hervé Dupont. See this guide. ;-)
@ENDNODE

@NODE Requis Requested
Flexy needs an Amiga with at least a 68000 CPU OS 3.x and ARexx. ;o)

By the way, it needs these softwares to work:

        - FlexCat 2.4+      (Aminet)
        - FlexCat 2.6.6+    (http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexcat/)
        - AwnPipe 2.34+     (http://web.ukonline.co.uk/awnpipe/index.html)
        - RexxReqTools 1.3  (Aminet)
        - ClassAct          (http://www.amitrix.com/Files/classact33.lha)


See @{" Greetings " LINK "Merci"} part for more informations about their
respective authors.

@ENDNODE

@NODE installation
@{B}@{U}Information@{UU} : @{UB} Flexy can be modified in easy way, so to
avoid maximum fake versions, I choose to sign it with PGP 2.6.3i. I invite
you to check it, before updating it.

My PGP pub key is available on request.

How to check: PGP:PGP ram:flexy.sig ram:flexy

@{B}@{U}Installation@{UU} : @{UB}
Best is to use the installation script provided in package. It should
process all correctly, well... I hope. ;-)

If you prefer to install it manualy, respect the following:

- Copy Flexy directory where you want. But if you want to use the catalog
of your language, you need to copy it to Locale:Your_language/ or make
Flexy directory as autopath like assign or Path add.
Eg: "Path DH2:my_dir/flexy/ add ".

- A good way is to use SYS:Tools/Flexy path.

- Check stack is set to 12000 or more.

You NEED also to use some other software: ARexx must be launch, AwnPipe must
be mount (L:awnpipe.handler and Mount awnpipe: (inside a Shell or CLI)).
Library RexxReqTools.library must be in Libs:

See the documentation of each program...

@ENDNODE

@NODE Presentation "Presentation"
@{U}Note@{UU}: ARexx must be launched and AwnPipe: mount. See
@{"installation" LINK installation} page.

Easy to use, Flexy uses the three following clicktabs:

1) ClickTab @{"options" LINK onglet1} gives a way to activate/desactivate all
   V2.4+ FlexCat options.

2) ClickTab @{"Commands" LINK onglet2} is the main window of Flexy. Use it to set-up
   and start the catalogs compilation.

3) ClickTab @{"Settings" LINK onglet3} will give you a way to use some Flexy settings and
   to Load/save options.

4) Some Key stroke @{"Shortcut" LINK gen}.

You can now quit Flexy by a normal way with the close gadget or use either
the menu item, or the Quit button in third clicktab gadget or use ESC key.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Onglet1 "ClickTab Options"

@{B}Options :@{UB} This page is splitted in two parts. The first one inside a frame is
a copy of three options which can be set or unset in main window @{"Commands" LINK onglet2}.
Second one shows all other options that Flexcat can manage with.

No special order:

See Flexcat documentation...

@ENDNODE

@NODE Onglet2  "ClickTab Commands"
@{B}Commands :@{UB}

Select the name of description catalog file. (Source)
Select the name of initial or new translation file.
Select the name of second translation file if update needed.
Select the name of final catalog file. (Destination)

Both gadgets (buttons) to the right of description and translation fields
provide a way to make an automatic copy of the file name and its path to the
field below and to add the right extension.

First gadget will react only in creation translation mode and in others
modes if translation file exists.

@{B}Mode@{UB} :

   @{U}Make catalog@{UU} : Create a catalog file from a description file and a
   translation file.

   @{U}Update translation@{UU} : Make an update of a translation file from a
   (new) description file and an (old) translation file.

   @{U}Make translation@{UU} : Make the first translation file from
   a description file.

@ENDNODE

@NODE Onglet3  "ClickTab Settings"
@{B}Settings :@{UB}

- Clever mode (names): a 'clever' management of filenames from description
  file which provide an automatic choice (if exists) of other files with
  automatic extensions. Eg: `File.cd' => `File.ct' and `File.catalog'.

- Add path in fields: Add in other fields the path used above.

@{fg highlight}*@{fg text} - Default path : You can enter here the working
  directory used a lot for your translations work.
  When this field is empty, it's the 'PROGDIR:' (where Flexy was launched)
  path which is used.

  This option can be used mixed with 'Clever mode names' but it can becaomes
  ennoying when using differents path for each type of files like '.cd',
  '.ct' or '.catalog'. I, this case, disable 'Clever mode'.

  This option became obsolete the one on 'Add path in fields', anyway,
  feature is prety different and can be useful for some people, so I kept
  it. I had hardly break my mind on conception to not remove a work... ;-))

                        ---------------------------

- Load settings at launch: Load Flexy settings when it launch. Else it use
  a default configuration.

- Ask before to quit: Show a request to confirm the quit action.
  Flexy do not says if settings were modified or not!

- Create log file for Flaxcat messages: when this option is activated,
  errors and warning messages than Flexcat could send, are saved in
  'RAM:Flex_Error' file.

Note than messages like that when making un update :
Prgs:Sources/language.ct, ligne 215. Warning: ID MSG_Msg_win, is missing
 from .ct.
is not realy an error, that's just to inform you the string isn't in the
initial .ct file. Logicaly, it could appear in the new .ct file (updated)
with comment ;***NEW*** just below.

                        ---------------------------

- Both buttons « Load » and « Save » are used to load and save the Flexy
  settings. Flexcat options and Flexy prefs are put in a Flexy.config
  located to `S:'.

Note: « Load » button is available only if a config file already exists.
      (saved a previous one).

@ENDNODE

@NODE utilisation "Utilisation"
@{fg highlight}*@{fg text}
Well, here how to use Flexy with efficiency.

The default settings are good enough for most of work then usage is done
by clicktab Commands:

@{b}A/ How to make a '.ct' file?@{ub}

1) Select 'Make translation' in Mode cycle gadget.

2) In first field 'Description' place your 'Flexy.cd' file by using the
file gadget between the name of field and field itself.

3) By default, the correct name 'Flexy.ct' is filled automaticly in the
second field 'Translation' with the full path of previous field.
Example: 1) Description: DH4:Translations/Flexy.cd
         2) Translation: DH4:Translations/Flexy.ct

Your are free to chose any location.

4) Click on 'Compile' button.

5) The screen make flash (Bip), if option 'Create log file...' is set in
'Settings' clicktab, you can find in a file named 'RAM:Flex_error' with
the errors or warnings reporting by Flexcat.


@{b}B/ How to update a '.ct' file?@{ub}

You already have a '.ct' file and got a new '.cd' file then to update the
translation file without loose your previous job, play like that: ;)

1) Select 'Update translation' in Mode cycle gadget. The third field will be
available.

2) and 3) like @{b}A@{ub} section

3 bis) if the translation named is not using exactly the description
basename, you have to select the file with the file-requester (gadget).
Example: 'Flexy.cd' and 'Flexy_Fr.ct' the part '_Fr' will not be handle
automaticly.

The third field 'Updated .ct' should display the name of the updated '.ct'
file with an extra 'N' at end like 'Flexy.ctN'. N stand for 'New'. ;-)

4) and 5) as previous.

Now you just have to go in your favorite editor and update the translation
file. I suggest you rename old '.ct' file '.ct_old' and '.ctN' by '.ct'.


@{b}C/ How to create a catalog '.catalog' file?@{ub}

1) Select 'Make catalog' in Mode cycle gadget. The third field will be
disalable.

2) and 3) like @{b}A@{ub} section

3 bis) if the translation named is not using exactly the description
basename, you have to select the file with the file-requester (gadget).
Example: 'Flexy.cd' and 'Flexy_Fr.ct' the part '_Fr' will not be handle
automaticly.

4) and 5) as previous.

Check catalog errors using Catcheck (Aminet) of Sönke Tesch to verify
the conformity between '.cd', '.ct' and '.catalog' files.

That's all... :)

More tips:

@{b}D/ I've work a lot and each dir-path are far away from default path@{ub}

To get back on default path, you have two choices:
  1) Load settings, (menu or 'settings' clicktab).
  2) Click on GetDir defalt path gadget and validate by ok.

In both cases, default path will be back in the four string fields.

@ENDNODE

@NODE gen "Shorcuts"

`ESC' key is used to quit the window (Flexy) (with confirmation or not in
function of your settings set in @{"Settings" LINK onglet3} clicktab).
`ESC' will also quit the other information windows.

The `Return' key is used to validate a field or to say `Ok' in other windows.
