  The oop.library contains only one class called RootClass. The methods
  and attributes for this class will be described here.

    METHODS

  OOPRCM_NEW_OBJECT (APTR MemoryPool, APTR *UserObject, struct TagItem *AttrList)
    This method is used to allow a class to create it's own data structure for
    an object. The pointer to this object should be returned in UserObject
    (Example: *UserObject = MyOwnPrivateData). The MemoryPool is a standard
    amiga os memorypool, allocated with only the MEMF_ANY flag. The AttrList
    is a taglist containing the initialisation values for the attributes.
    The method can be viewed as the C++ constructor.

  OOPRCM_DELETE_OBJECT (APTR MemoryPool)
    When an object is deleted, this method is called to allow the class to
    free any private data. The method can be viewed as the C++ destructor.

  OOPRCM_GET_ATTRIBUTES (struct TagItem *AttrList)
    Used to get attribute values. The values will be written in the taglist's
    data fields. Note that the implementing class itself should replace all
    processed tags by TAG_IGNORE and propagate the method upwards if
    necessary, by returning OOPMCR_METHOD_PROPAGATE.

  OOPRCM_SET_ATTRIBUTES (struct TagItem *AttrList)
    Used to set attribute values. Note that the implementing class itself
    should replace all processed tags by TAG_IGNORE and propagate the method
    upwards if necessary, by returning OOPMCR_METHOD_PROPAGATE.


    ATTRIBUTES

  OOPRCA_VERSION - version number of the class.
  OOPRCA_REVISION - revision number of the class.
  OOPRCA_INFO - a general description of the class.
  OOPRCA_AUTHOR - the name of the author of the class.

oop.library/OOP_AddClass                             oop.library/OOP_AddClass

    NAME
  OOP_AddClass -- add a class to the public classlist

    SYNOPSIS
  error = OOP_AddClass(class, name)
  D0                   A0     A1

  LONG OOP_AddClass(APTR, STRPTR);

    FUNCTION
  This function will add a class to the public classlist. If the class
  is already present on the list, this function returns with an
  errorcode.

    INPUTS
  class -- the class that should be added to the list.
  name -- the name under which the class should be made public.

    RESULT
  This function will return OOPACR_OK if the class was added to the list,
  or an errorcode defined in oop.h.

    SEE ALSO
  OOP_RemClass(), oop.h

oop.library/OOP_AddMethod                           oop.library/OOP_AddMethod

    NAME
  OOP_AddMethod -- add a method to a class

    SYNOPSIS
  error = OOP_AddMethod(class, methodID, hook)
  D0                    A0     D0        A1

  LONG OOP_AddMethod(APTR, ULONG, struct Hook *);

    FUNCTION
  A method will be added to a class, if the method did not exist already.
  This function assumes that the given hook is valid. Patching an existing
  method can be done by removing the old method first and then adding the
  new method with the same methodID.

    INPUTS
  class -- the class to which the method should be added.
  methodID -- the unique identification for the method.
  hook -- a completely initialized hook structure. If the h_Data field
          contains anything but NULL, this value will be put in a6. This
          was done to overcome some problems with calling libcode (which
          expect the libbase in a6) through callback hooks (which will
          have the library that contains the callback function in a6).

    RESULT
  OOPAMR_OK, if all went ok. An errorcode defined in oop.h if something
  wasn't right.

oop.library/OOP_AddSuperClass                   oop.library/OOP_AddSuperClass

    NAME
  OOP_AddSuperClass -- add a superclass to a class

    SYNOPSIS
  error = OOP_AddSuperClass(class, superClass)
  D0                        A0     A1

  LONG OOP_AddSuperClass(APTR, APTR);

    FUNCTION
  This function will add a superclass to a class. This superclass will then
  be used to provide inheritance for it's subclasses. If a superclass is
  added to a class that already has objects of itself, the needed superclass
  objects are automaticaly added to those objects. Note that the added
  superclass objects will be initialized to their default values.

    INPUTS
  class -- class to add the superclass to.
  superClass -- a class that will provide it's functionality to the specified
                class through inheritance.

    RESULT
  OOPASCR_OK if the adding was successful, an errorcode otherwise.

  D0                       A0

  LONG OOP_DeleteObject(APTR);

    FUNCTION
  This function will delete an object and all it's superclass objects. Note
  that this function will fail if the given object is a class that has
  objects or if the class is added to the public classlist. If the object
  is a class, all of the classes' methods will also be removed.

    INPUTS
  object -- the object to delete.

    RESULT
  OOPDOR_OK, if successful, an errorcode otherwise.

  LONG OOP_DoMethod(APTR, ULONG, ULONG *);

    FUNCTION
  This function will perform a method upon an object.

    INPUTS

             method. Look at the method description, to see what should
             be in this array.

    RESULT
  OOPMCR_METHOD_ACCEPTED, OOPMCR_METHOD_REJECTED, or an errorcode.

  LONG OOP_DoPropagatedMethod(APTR, ULONG, ULONG *);

    FUNCTION
  This function will perform a method upon an object and all it's superclass
  objects. The method will start at the top of the superclass tree and it
  will be propagated until all superclass objects and the object itself have
  performed the requested method.

    INPUTS
  object -- the object to perform the method upon.
  methodID -- the method that should be performed.
