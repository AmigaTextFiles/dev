That program shows the POWER (!!?) of my 24bit to 256colors remapping, the
PPct !! It is very fast, you can see from the Kube demo, wich loads 6
textures and remaps them very fastly; the quality is not the best possible,
but is quite good: this program shows you. Start the ShowAllWithKubePal
script, it will show you all the 6 textures of Kube remapped into the
palette of the Kube demo, wich is a summary of all the palettes of the
images: I have done with PPaint. Note, that program is not FFFast, because
for every image everything is reloaded: wild,extensions,screen,....
to see the speed, see Kube: the time after the screen opening and the
first frame you will see the HD flashing 6 times: the time between 2 reads
is used to remap the 24bit chunky texture into the palette of the scene.
