That's a demo to show the load/save abilities of Wild. It can read a file (of a scene,
so you can read simple.wabl (from SimpleWorld) or fountain.wabl (from FountainOfFire)
and save it in another file format. The only load format now if WABL, and also the
only SAVE one. The SAVE is still not perfect... it lacks textures/palette saving (coded,
but not works) and some other things, so won't work perfectly if you overwrite the
original file: you have to manually edit it.
Also, obviously, ALL names,labels, are lost in the conversion: Wild re-generates the
names, in a not very esotic way... if you had World/[DeeperUnderground], you will
probably have in the saved one a World/[World000000A2] ...

17/5/99: Now you can even use this demo to convert scene files from WABL to WSFF
(and vice-versa), simply do: LoadSave WABL WSFF simple.wabl simple.wsff to convert
the SimpleWorld's file (WABL) to WSFF. WSFF saving works perfectly, WABL has
still some bugs...
