Yeah !
That's the first Animated demo, wich shows the new Animation features of Wild.
This includes only traslation animation (so objects are managed in their moving,
but not in their rotating). It shows a Fountain that creates a lot of Drops (1
every new frame, so depending on different systems) and makes them doing an Action.
An Action is something like a :
SET the Y speed to -10, SET the Y acceleration to +2,WAIT 200 ticks, then stop (and
cancel the drop). So, you can set to any sector a speed and an acceleration (a X,Y,Z)
and then all is automatically managed. Also, it's TIMED (in ticks: 50 ticks=1 second).
You can see that is TIMED by pressing the JOY-BUTTON: as other demos, this will
freeze the frame. When you release it, you will see the drops are fallen also if you
didn't see them (unlike Cynematik animation, wich was manually done and NOT timed).

17/5/99: Now also rotation of the drops, to show the rotational engine...
