That is the classic 3D demo: a rotating textured cube.
Note: it has still some problems, due to my BSP-tree bugs, and also
because it is handly made, some BSP-nodes may be wrong. Also some
drawing bugs are showed there !! ARG ! This program shows ANY bug I
have !! Just see the positive things: 24bit remapped textures,
... uhm.. very bad !

20/4/99 !!! Fixed a bug in the scene construction ! Was an edge wrong !
	That was the face with the sunset bug! Not a broker bug as I 
	thinked before !
17/5/99 Various fixes in Wild, now looks even better, and you can see 
        the light on top more clearly now...
