That is one of the first demos, and you can see from the source, if you
get it in the DEV archive. The objects are not made using wild STD funcs,
because they did not existed at this time, but are builded in the source.
Only the texture is loaded with the new method.
I keep those demos because they are the best-looking ones: the Skrumpler
object shows even some FEATURES of wild, and not only bugs... :)

17/5/99 I don't know if this is still working, because a lot of things changed and
        this demo is coded in an OLD way, without objects constructed or loaded, but
        pre-assembled in the source... BAD. It seems to work when no texture is
        loaded, but NO WARRANTY on that... included just for historical reasons...
