This demo is done to:
- show a lot of polys on screen (1776)
- show the rotational engine power: you see the earth rotation, and the sun (and the ring)
  rotating with it. Then, the ring rotates on his axis by his own, and even the sun.
  Just 3 moves (and an unique action) to have this...
You should try this on PPC, it's much better... (even on PPC it's slow, but it's a
question of optimization: this Wild PPC is NOT optimized: just think the BSP is always
re-made, and mooore things to improve. I have to think some BSP-optimizations, to
cut out all useless re-calculations...)
