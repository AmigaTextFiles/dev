That is another important demo, because it is the first using the
LoadWildObject function, and using the WABL loader. That fileformat
is very simple and long (text-based, with a gerarchical tree, objects
and attributes) but is enough for now. The file is handly made, if
you want, you can modify it...
Also this demo shows some bugs: my lighting is quite bad...
sorry, next release will show better gfx, I hope...
