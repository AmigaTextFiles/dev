That is another important demo, because it is the first using the
LoadWildObject function, and using the WABL loader. That fileformat
is very simple and long (text-based, with a gerarchical tree, objects
and attributes) but is enough for now. The file is handly made, if
you want, you can modify it...
Also this demo shows some bugs: my lighting is quite bad...
sorry, next release will show better gfx, I hope...

8/5/99: Now the lighting is better, even if it's not sooo nice, but it's a
gouraud problem, I think: that algo is not good for BIG faces, and the ground
here is a TOO big face...
This demo is kept WABL, just to show that is still exists and it's good, for
little scenes. Other demos are converted to WSFF (WildSuperFastFile (super?
eh, compared to WABL, anything is SuperFast...))
