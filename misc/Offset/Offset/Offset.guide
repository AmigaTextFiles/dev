Offset is a little utility for programmers to calculate the offset of
a field from any OS 3.1 structure, the size of the structure or what field
there is at a certain offset. For example:

offset gadget.width          @{B}Output:@{UB} @{FG SHINE}8@{FG TEXT}

offset gadget.8              @{B}Output:@{UB} @{FG SHINE}Width@{FG TEXT}

offset gadget                @{B}Output:@{UB} @{FG SHINE}44@{FG TEXT}

offset gadget.$1e            @{B}Output:@{UB} @{FG SHINE}MutualExclude@{FG TEXT}

offset gadget.0x1A           @{B}Output:@{UB} @{FG SHINE}GadgetText@{FG TEXT}

There are some additional options available. See @{" Usage " LINK "Usage"}

Use the supplied installation script to install Offset!!! If you do not then
watch out:

Offset usually needs to have it's comment (fib_Comment) set to the path of
"Structure.Offsets", i.e. the file containing the information about the OS
3.1 structures. I say usually because if Offset can't retrieve the path from
the comment it will still try to load the file from (in this order):

	"Structure.Offsets"
	"PROGDIR:Structure.Offsets"
	"S:Structure.Offsets"

Offset can actually be used only from a Shell:

The argument template of Offset is:

                 @{FG SHINE}NAME/A,SHOWHEX/S,SHOWSIZE/S,SHOWWINDOW/S@{FG TEXT}

@{FG SHINE}___________________________________________________________________________@{FG TEXT}
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

@{FG SHINE}NAME@{FG TEXT}        Depends on what information you want to get. To get the size of
            a structure specify only it's name. For example:

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Window
	        136

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Window SHOWHEX
	        136 0x0088

	    To get the offset of a structure field specify both the struc-
	    ture name and the field name, separated by '@{FG SHINE}.@{FG TEXT}', '@{FG SHINE}->@{FG TEXT}' or '@{FG SHINE}^.@{FG TEXT}'.
	    For example:
	    
		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Window.Title
		32

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Window->Title
		32

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Window^.Title
		32

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Window.Title SHOWHEX
		32 0x0020

	    To find out what field there is at a certain structure offset,
	    you must specify both the structure name and the offset, again
	    separated by '@{FG SHINE}.@{FG TEXT}', '@{FG SHINE}->@{FG TEXT}' or '@{FG SHINE}^.@{FG TEXT}'. The offset must be specified
	    either in decimal or hex format. For example:
	    
		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Screen.14
		Title

	    	@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Screen.0xE
	    	Title

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Screen.$E
		Title

	    Note that some structures have more fields at the same offset
	    (unions). Offset will output all of them, including the union
	    name. For example:
	    
	    	@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset DosList.16
		dol_misc
		dol_misc.dol_handler
		dol_misc.dol_handler.dol_Handler
		dol_misc.dol_volume
		dol_misc.dol_volume.dol_VolumeDate
		dol_misc.dol_assign
		dol_misc.dol_assign.dol_AssignName


@{FG SHINE}SHOWHEX@{FG TEXT}     Print the result also in hex. The output will be:

		<DEC><@{FG FILL}SPACE@{FG TEXT}><HEX>

	    For example:

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Screen.Title SHOWHEX
		22 0x0016

	    This option does of course not affect the output if you were
	    asking for the field name of a structure's offset.


@{FG SHINE}SHOWSIZE@{FG TEXT}    Prints also the size of a field. If you were asking for the off-
	    set of a certain structure's field, the output will be either:

		[<FIELDSIZE>]<@{FG FILL}SPACE@{FG TEXT}><OFFSET>

	    or, if you have also specified SHOWHEX:

	    	[<FIELDSIZE>]<@{FG FILL}SPACE@{FG TEXT}><DEC-OFFSET><@{FG FILL}SPACE@{FG TEXT}><HEX-OFFSET>

	    If you were asking for the field name of a structure's offset,
	    the output will be:

		[<FIELDSIZE>]<@{FG FILL}SPACE@{FG TEXT}><FIELDNAME>

	    The width of <FIELDSIZE> is always three characters! Examples:

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Screen.Title SHOWSIZE
		[  4] 22

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Screen.Title SHOWSIZE SHOWHEX
		[  4] 22 0x0016

		@{BG SHINE}1.@{BG FILL}@{FG SHINE}Boot:C@{BG SHINE}@{FG TEXT}>@{BG BACKGROUND} offset Screen.22 SHOWSIZE
		[  4] Title


@{FG SHINE}SHOWWINDOW@{FG TEXT}  Instead of printing the result to the output window it will be
	    shown in a requester.

@{FG SHINE}@{B}PowerWindows (Shareware):@{UB}@{FG TEXT}

This Program allows you to move Windows out of Screen!!!!!!! No joke!
It's real! The Windows also get an Iconify-Gadget which allows you to
iconify Windows in a 100 % compatible way! Check this out!! Tons of
features, works on GFX-Boards!!!

@{FG SHINE}@{B}PowerWB (Shareware):@{UB}@{FG TEXT}

PowerWB improves the good (??) old (!!) standard Workbench of the Amiga a
little bit. I know there are more and more Workbench replacements coming
out, these days. Some of them are really good but anyway not everybody
of us will stop using the standard Workbench, whatever the reasons might
be (too much memory usage, incompatibility, too expensive, too slow etc.)

PowerWB adds the following new features to the Workbench:

- Two new gadgets will be added to the titlebar of the workbench windows.
  One to switch the "View by" mode ("Icon" / "Name") and the other to switch
  the "Show" mode ("Only Icons" / "All Files")

- PowerWB allows you to use the keyboard for some operations which normally
  can only be done by accessing the menu or the gadgets.

@{FG SHINE}@{B}PowerIcons (Giftware):@{UB}@{FG TEXT}

This little commodity removes the border around the Icons when you drag
them. It makes color 0 of the Icons transparent. This program is especially
useful if you use NewIcons V3. NewIcons already removed the border around
the Icons but not when you dragged them.

@{FG SHINE}@{B}StackAttack (Freeware):@{UB}@{FG TEXT}

StackAttack can help avoiding/killing GURUs (especially strange and casual
ones). GURUs are sometimes caused by a too low stack of some programs. With
StackAttack you can select what minimum and additional stack new processes
(programs) shall get. Source is included.

@{FG SHINE}@{B}KeyReq (Freeware):@{UB}@{FG TEXT}

Small but cool requester improver. Does *not* replace the requesters with
the ones from ReqTools. It's possible to cycle through the gadgets of the
requester (similiar to MUI). You can have the requesters opened in the cen-
ter of the screen or under the mouse pointer. Works also with requesters
created by BuildEasyRequestArgs() and BuildSysRequest(). Supports asynchron
requesters. You can control the requester with the keyboard. Source is in-
cluded.

Like CopyNewIcon, but copies both the old image and the NewIcon image. This
utility is especially useful for programmers who want to have the icons of
their programs in both the old and the new look. Source code is included.

@{FG SHINE}@{B}WBAttack (Freeware):@{UB}@{FG TEXT}

WBAttack is a little program which allows you to change the backdrop mode
of the main Workbench window. It is (mainly) intended to be used with pro-
grams like Toolmanager which allow starting programs with a configurable
hotkey. As such hotkeys can be used in any occasion (it does not matter
which window or screen is the active one) accessing the icons of the main
Workbench window (by switching the Workbench backdrop mode off, which brings
the Workbench window automatically to front) will be very very easy.
