LIBSearcher 3.1b by Thomas Kessler

Fast library function searcher, including all AmigaOS 3.1 functions!
Custom functions can be added via datafile.

This new LIBSearcher is based on the old LIBSearcher 2.01 by Joep Grooten
(Digital Intelligence, J.J. Allanstr. 222, 1551 RR Westzaan, Holland).

I wrote Joep some lines quite a while ago and asked for an update
but I didn't get any response, so I decided to make an own update.
First I only wanted to implement the new AmigaOS 3.x functions, but
then I added a lot more small details and features:

- added all AmigaOS 3.1 functions
- removed all private OS-functions (I hope, I got them all)
- improved search-speed
- added hex-offsets
- added custom datafile-support
- added pubscreen-support
- rewrote most of the original code in asm
- other small enhancements
- removed detaching from Shell (crashed sometimes my Amiga)
- needs OS2.0+ now

If you want more or other features, just send me a small email with
your suggestions.

Usage from Shell: LIBSearcher DATAFILE,PUBSCREEN/K

DATAFILE
 can be your own datafile. If no datafile is specified, a file
 called 'LIB.Data' will be searched in the current directory.
 Take a look at the supplied datafile for the datafile-format,
 which should look like the following lines:

 dc.b "!libname:",$0a
 dc.b "dec hex function1(parameter)(regs)",$0a
 dc.b "dec hex function2(parameter)(regs)",$0a

PUBSCREEN
 can be a public screen, where the LIBSearcher-window will be
 opened on (if possible). The syntax is PUBSCREEN=<pubscreenname>
 at the LIB commandline. Default is the Workbench-screen.

Some hints:

Type -offset instead of offset if you search for a decimal value
and type $offset if you search for a hex value to avoid wrong results.

Add smth. like 'Alias LIB Run <>NIL: Work:Tools/LIB Data:data/LIB2.data'
to your S:Shell-Startup for better handling.

History:

3.1  (1.2.96) first release
3.1a (1.2.96) enabled custom datafile-reading (forgot that :-)
3.1b (3.2.96) fixed a small bug that could lead to 'trashed' text-output
