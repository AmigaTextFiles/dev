Projects to do in this wild, some designs...

Now: separe apps and scenes: are different things: an app may change scene, a scene
may be shared by more apps.

Library sections:

 - app manager: add,remove,manager (can make the library render,calc things,and more)
 - scene manager: provides funcs to help the user in the scene animation, like
   rotate, animate funcs, maybe also define an anim format... more to define...
   also load,remove,... different formats loader (the first will be the LoadSeg file,
   but in a future there may be also an IFF format, to make less dependent on dos.library.
   in the future, by somebody other, may also be a LW-loader and similar... or VRML...


AppManager section:

 -needed funcs:
  -AddWildApp,RemWildApp,SetWildAppTags,GetWildAppTags
  
 - about the render engine: should be a sub-task, with the same or lower pri of
   the game (or it will block everything) and higher than normal tasks (would be
   slow). Best i thing is 8 for renderer and 9 for game. Obviously, game should
   only check the events, and pass much time waiting.
   
 - the render function should work async: first of all, should refer all to Camera
   (this, sync: need to be sure it's not changed) then ask the renderer task of the 
   app to start calcing everything else. The game then would wait the message of my
   rendered task to start rendering next frame.
 

SceneManager section:
 
 -needed funcs:
   LoadScene
