WildEngineer is a sublib of wild, like WildPrefs.

It will be used to provide support funcs like Modules finding,
engine repairing and anything will come.

Maybe i'll move the LoadModule & KillModule management here...

Functions:

HaveModuleInfo(tags).	This structure will return an info about the module,
			more to define. I'll need to know about the Types.
FreeModuleInfo(minfo).	This will free the buffer allocated by HaveModuleInfo.
HaveBestModules(tags).	This will return a LIST of modules,all the ones wich fit
			in the description gave by tags. If some tags are not
			restrictive but just indicative (Speed,Quality...) they
			are sorted from the best to the worst.
			MUST specify ONE type: use the WIAP_??Module set to TRUE
			to select.
FreeBestModules(bm).	This will free the buffer allocated by HaveBestModules.
HaveEngineCheck(wapp).	This will check if the engine is working (all modules
			well initialized, all modules compatible...).
			If bad, will return a structure describing the problems.
FreeEngineCheck(ec).	This will free the buffer allocated by HaveEngineCheck.
RepairEngine(wapp,tags).Will call checkengine, and then repair the engine by
			flushing useless modules and loading the right ones.
			The tags can define your preferences in the modules
			selecting and flushing, by using indicative tags (Speed,
			Quality) and giving a score to the Modules (with the STD
			WIAP_??Module tags): if there are multiple soluctions, 
			will be used the one keeping your preferred modules, if
			possible.
LoadModule(tags).	Future: do here the Module loading, WITH TAGS!
KillModule(module).	Future: do here the Module killing.
