Saver module design.

It's the complement of Loader. It will be used mainly for editing funcs, so the
objs simple editors will use it. Maybe also useful as object-converter Wild use,
but that's a future thing.

Funcs: the complements of the Loader.

SaveWildObject will call SaverModule and will ask:

NewObject(type,prec,parent): Will make a new object. Objects are linked themself
                             by a list, if they are brother. If no prec specified,
                             no brothers. If parent is specified, link to it and
                             allocate new memory from parent's pool.
SaveObject(...): Will save on file the object created and filled previously.
SetObjectAttr(obj,attr,value): Will set an object's property.
OriginalObject(obj) returns the original Wild object from the Saver's object.
PrivateObject(wobj) returns the private object for the Wild's one.
FreeObject(obj)  Frees the object and all the childs. (POOLS ARE STRONGLY ADVICED!)
