(19/10/98) First public release. It's quite an alpha.

- FIXED:	A double opening of a module CAUSES BIG TROUBLES !!!
		The NODE in list is RE-Inserted in the list, and causes big
		troubles. This is the DOUBLE-Closing bug in the wild.library!
		(to fix, do a check in load/kill module, add a wild opencount,...)
		Now IT's FIXED, with the wm_CNT! Warning with old modules !

- FIXED:	KillerBug in DisplayPlanarScreen: first, it was writing in the
		Draw engine data, not in the Display !! And then, it allocated
		the TmpRas, the AreaInfo and more with AllocVecPooled and freed
		it with FreeMem ! Bleah.

- FIXED:	Now, i have a working draw pipeline, so i can concentrate on the
		3D checking of the Refs system. I viewed it was all wrong. I'm
		looking for the bugs in TDCoreSimplyFast.
		I've fixed one, where were exchanged the child and the parent link.
		Then, fixed more: now seems ok. But never say...
		
- TO FIX:	The DOUBLE-Closing BUG REVENGE !!! Maybe some modules too old, to
		fix from the first time ? Or more conceptual bugs like the precedent?
		Mah.			
		
- FIXED:	Another (new) bug in the closing: the tables killing!
		Was because i changed the input of KillTable: no more pointing
		on the struct wt_Table, but on the wt_Data !! So, when killing,
		was forgot to add wt_Data to a1.
		Probably, that was the DOUBLE-Closing revenge... but is to check.
		
- TO RECODE:	In TDCoreSimplyFast, there is a bad-working test, the diagonals
		edges outcheck: it removed more edges than is should do. So, just
		for now, i removed it. When there is time, recode ! It causes bad
		errors, especially with very big faces!

- FIXED:	In TDCoreSimplyFast, recoded the OutFace check: 3 Hidden-> OutFace
		and 2 Out-> OutFace! Caused BAD Crashes ! (Crash04 is ALSO for this
		bug.)

- FIXED: 	In TDCoreSimplyFast, bugs in the BSP-Inserting routine!? The
		BspPointers have a bad offset and trash-up the structure!?
		!! It's AllocVecPooled who Trashes everything !! Because of
		a bad write, the Pool is broken, so this routine does bas things.
		Thanks to my MungwallLike system (just added) i found the badwrite.
		It's in the BSPEntries memory: more faces than they should are
		written here: SOME ARE INSERTED TWICE !!!
		So, it's a BSP-Insert BUG !!! FindOut it.
		Fixed! Was a very Unlucky case: if 2 sectors child were attached
		to the same parent's face, the BspSave of this face was broken:
		after the first attach, all ok, after the second attach, was
		copyed on bspsave also the first attach. So, one sector was
		kept attached even after the breakjoins cycle.
				
- TO FIX:	There are more bad writes, probably in the Draw modules (hope no
		Display!) because my MungwallLike system signals some hits (in
		the Display module,why ? go to check,please!) with all the Flat
		series (Fluff & Candy), and all the same hit.

- FIXED:	A closing bug in DisplayPeter&James: if no screen, a lot of bad
		free were done.

- TO FIX:	If all edges are z-out in distance (may be in other cases also)
		bad errors, like edges with no TmpBuffer but not flagged as bad.
		If you have time...

- TO FIX:	Peter&James can be dangerous if used by more than 1 app, because
		of the variables inside the code (chunky buffer pointers, mainly),
		you must reload them on every frame!

- FIXED:	In Peter&James was used my AllocBitmap routine, but was useless and
		buggy (memory crash), so i used the STDBITMAP screen type. Better
		and safer.

- TO FIX:	Still some bugs when faces are Z=0 (i think), they are splatted around.

- TO DO:	In Tix+ broker the textures edges loop is very sure but very 
		unoptimized. When have time, do the rewrite.
		
- TO ADD:	The SUBS system: all the modules can require wild to open some more
		sublibs, containing maybe only one routine: for example, a lot of
		brokers may require the scanline part, and that can be put in a
		sublib.
		
- TO ADD:	In a quite far future, to make more perfect, add a WildManager:
		a simple library useful to manage objects lists: Modules, Extensions,
		Tables and what more else. That library must have 4 funcs principally:
		a FindObject(object id tags),AddObject(object params) (with
		double-loading check using FindObject, done automatically), a
		RemObject(object) with automatical OPENCOUNT and a DropAllObjects(header)
		to expugne all objects in the list.
