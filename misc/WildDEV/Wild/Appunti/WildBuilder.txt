WildBuilder is the part of wild.library (not a sublibrary, now)
that manager the creation of the scene and all related objects.

Needed funcs:

- AllocWildObject(wapp,tags)		; used to allocate everything... (wapp used for pool use)
- FreeWildObject(obj)			; (allocated via allocvecpooled: nothing more needed)
- SetWildObjectTags(obj,type,tags)

BETTER!!:

- BuildWildObject(tags)			; used to manage the object, set tags, and even BUILD IT if the BuildObject tag is specified and TRUE. Returns the pointer if BUILD is TRUE, or TRUE if nothing bad happened. FALSE for any error.
- FreeWildObject(obj)			; same.
