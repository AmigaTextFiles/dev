        NAME
                AddWildApp
        
        SYNOPSIS
                wildapp = AddWildApp(WildPort,TagList);
                D0                      A0      A1
                
                struct WildApp *AddWildApp(struct MSGPort *,struct TagItem *);
                
        FUNCTION
                Allocates a WildApp struct, and initializes it with the provided
                tags. Not specified tags are set to wild's default. SetWildAppTags
                is called by this function.
                
        INPUTS
                WildPort - A STD exec MSGPort, used to comunicate with wild.
                TagList  - taglist to initialize the app.
                
        RESULT
                WildApp  - a WildApp struct, used for everything in Wild.

        NAME
                AddWildThread
                        
        SYNOPSIS
                wildthread=     AddWildThread(WildApp,TagList)
                D0                              A0      A1

                struct  WildThread      *AddWildThread(struct WildApp *,struct TagItem *);
                
        FUNCTION
                Allocated a WildThread struct and starts the new thread.
                Note: Your thread doesn't need to preserve any regs, or to
                manage any Process Flag (those boring PRF_FreeCli,FreeOutput,Free??)
                because Wild manages them for you. The WildThread structure is
                given to the Thread as input in the A0 register: read there your
                Args (specified with WITH_Args tag.)
                
        INPUTS
                WildApp - A WildApp structure.
                TagList - A TagList to init the Thread.         
        RESULT
                WildThread - A WildThread structure.

        NAME
                BuildWildObject
                
        SYNOPSIS
                object= BuildWildObject(tags)
                D0                      A0

                ULONG   *BuildWildObject(struct TagItem *tags);
                
        FUNCTION
                That's a powerful function to create anything in the Scene.
                It's quite low-level, is mainly used by the Loader modules when
                loading a scene-file. 
                You can use this func to create new objects or to modify existing.
                See tags description.
                
                WIBU_ObjectType :(REQUIRED) The type of object to create/modify.
                One of those OBJECT_???.
                WIBU_BuildObject:If you want to create a NEW object, set this to true;
                You MUST also give the WIBU_WildApp tag, when creating new things,
                because wild needs to have memory from your pool.
                WIBU_WildApp    :Pass your WildApp here, NEEDED when creating 
                NEW objects.
                WIBU_ModifyObject: If you want to modify an existing object, pass it
                here. Obviously, you CAN'T specify that with WIBU_BuildObject !!!
                
                Then, you can specify ATTRS and FRIENDS, but not CHILDS. Those are used
                to code Loader modules.

        INPUTS
                tags = A taglist defining the properties of the object to build or modify.
                
        RESULT
                object = The modified or builded object.

        NAME

                LoadWildObject

        SYNOPSIS
                object= LoadWildObject(wildapp,tags)
                D0                      A0      A1

                ULONG   *BuildWildObject(struct WildApp *wapp,struct TagItem *tags);

        FUNCTION
                Loads an object from a filehandle, or using a readhook.
                Note that the specified file (or filehandle, or readhook)
                must contain the object you specified, not anything else.
                Usually, you should load a Level, or a Scene, but you can
                also load Textures, or Aliens, or even Faces (but these are
                untested).

                You can specify those tags:
                WILO_ObjectType :(REQUIDED) The type of object (OBJECT_???) to load.
                WILO_FileName   : The filename to load. If you specify that, the file
                will be loaded using dos.library. (in the future, also XPK support,
                but not now).
                WILO_FileHandle : Alternative, you can specify a filehandle of an already
                open file. The file will be readed from the current position, no Seek(0)
                will be performed. This allows you to read files step by step.
                WILO_ReadHook   : Another alternative, you can specify a hook to be called
                to read from anywhere: you can fake and read from mem, or using trackdisk,
                or anything else. Hook convention: A0:Hook A1:Buffer to fill A2:Len to read.
                Your hook should contain something like a file handle in the h_Data.
                WILO_LoadedAttrsFirst : Says to use first the attrs found in the file, and
                then, use yours attrs to fill the ones not present in the file. If you
                specify FALSE this, wild will first use your attrs and then fill the
                more needed with the ones loaded from the file.

                Then, add more ATTRS and FRIENDS, used as you specified.
                Note that those will affect only the object you load, but not any other
                child: if you load a scene, you cannot modify the world, the arenas, the
                aliens loeded with it. You can only modify the scene.

                Note that the object you have is made by BuildWildObject, so you
                can free it with FreeWildObject(); but remember: FreeWildObject won't
                free the object's childs.

        INPUTS
                wildapp = your WildApp.
                tags = taglist defining the file and the attrs of the object to load.

        RESULT
                object = a wildobject, or NULL if no object can be loaded.
