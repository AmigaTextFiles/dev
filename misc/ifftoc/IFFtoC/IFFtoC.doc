    Disclaimer:
    -----------

    I'm a poor man, so I must write this:

    This program is given to Public Domain with sourcecode as FREEWARE.  You
    may use it, like you want.

    If you want cook coffee with it ... feel free, to do it ... ;-))

    You can use the source complete or partially for your  own  product,  as
    long as you give a short remark in the source, from where you had gotten
    it.

    I held NOT liable in any manner, if by the use  of  the  source  or  the
    program occure any damage on hard- or software. Use it at your own risk.

    How to use:
    -----------

    1. Start the program by:
        - doublecklick the IFFtoC-icon or
        - in the CLI with : IFFtoC



    2. The program opens at first a little window, in which you  can  choose
       some options for the converting process:

       Sprite Header:    If you want to convert a  pic  for  a  sprite  (for
                         example  for  a  custom pointer) the program writes
                         the output as a sprite.
                         Default: off - no sprite

       Image Structures: Sometimes it maybe  not  neccessary  to  write  the
                         Image Structur for the pic (maybe if you convert  a
                         sprite) you can switch it off.
                         Default: on - Image Structure will be written

       Comments:         If this  switch  is  on,  the  program  writes  the
                         bitpattern  of  each  line  as a comment behind the
                         line. So you can roughly see your pic.
                         Default: On - comments will be written

       Left/TopEdge = 0: The LeftEdge and the TopEdge-values in  the  Image
                         structure are set to 0. This is usefull if you had
                         saved the pic as a iff-brush from a paintprogram.
                         The brush mostly contains the  Left/TopEdge-values
                         from the cutting.

       If all is choosen, click OK.


    3. The program then asks for the destination dir. This maybe  the  same,
       like the dir, in which your iff-files are placed.

    4. The program asks now for the iff-file(s). You may do a multiselect by
       holding down the Shift - key.

    5. By clicking OK, the program starts  the  conversion.  This  is  done,
       mostly  very  fast.  The  program  gives a message, which iff-file is
       current converted.

       The program creates each time a outputfile with the same  name,  like
       the  pic-file,  with  the  difference,  that  the extension ".iff" is
       exchanged by ".c". The filename is also used in the code (without the
       extension). You may alter it later, like you want.

       If there is already a file in the desination-dir, which have the same
       name,  like  the  oufile of the current for converting prepared file,
       you will get a warning, to decide if the file shall be overwritten or
       not.

    6. After the last conversion the program ask you, if you want to convert
       away (more files). So you can convert for example pics in another dir
       without to restart the program.

       If you answer with "Yes" the program starts again at number 3.

       If you want to alter the options, you must choose  "No"  and  restart
       the program.
