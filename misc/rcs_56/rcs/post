Revision Control Sys. v5.6 *AmigaDOS 2.0 ONLY*

This is version 5.6 of RCS, the latest from the RCS folks (the
one that came out on the Amiga World Tech Journal disk was 4.3).
The new version works with binary files as well as text files,
and has several other enhancements. Archive includes manual
pages (in Amiga format) and binaries: ci, co, rcsdiff, rlog,
rcs, merge, rcsmerge, and rcsclean. Also includes the latest
GNU diff (v1.15) which is required for RCS. *FREE* and the
source code is available. Send bug reports / comments to me:
