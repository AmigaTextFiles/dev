PatchAmigaBASIC

   There is one bad instruction in AmigaBASIC which the 68000 in a 
   standard Amiga seems to execute properly.  A 68020 has trouble
   with this bad instruction and performs a Guru Meditation trap.
   This program will fix the bad instruction in AmigaBASIC.

   USAGE:   PatchAmigaBASIC Path:AmigaBASIC

   Supply the full pathname for the location of AmigaBASIC.

   EXAMPLE:   PatchAmigaBASIC df1:AmigaBASIC

   You only need to run this program once on any copy of AmigaBASIC.
   The patched AmigaBASIC will still run on a normal 68000 based
   Amiga.  If you copy a patched AmigaBASIC to another disk or volume
   the copy retains the patch and will not have to patched again.
   This patch program is known to work properly on versions 1.0 and 1.2
   of AmigaBASIC.
