@{ub}

Inspector  was created to accompany the IceBreaker debugger.  When watching
the  IceBreaker  output,  you  will  notice  that  it  gives you all of the
addresses  of the objects being passed around the sytem.  For example, look
at the following output clipped from a real demo:

Init()                Bob-Tags: $43fea0, Screen: $45fa88
 Get()                Bob
 Message:             Bob trigger received.
 Get()                Picture
  Get()               Bitmap
 Init()               Bob: $462988, Screen: $45fa88
  Init:               Initialising Bob from a Picture source.
  CheckInit()         Object: $462bc0
  Init()              Picture: $462bc0

We can see three objects in this listing, and they are:

  Screen:  $45fa88
  Bob:     $462988
  Picture: $462bc0

What  we  can  do  here is use Inspector to find out further information on
these  objects.   If  we were to type in "View $45fa988" into the Inspector
console, we would get to see all of the Screens details, as follows:

  SCREEN VERSION 1
  ----------------
  Size:       320x256x5
  Attrib:     DBLBUFFER
  ScrMode:    LORES
  Bitmap:     $460428
  BmpXOffset: 0
  BmpYOffset: 0
  MemPtr1:    $1e6fe0
  MemPtr2:    $1f37f8
  MemPtr3:    $0
  Raster:     $0
  Switch:     0
  X-Offset:   0
  Y-Offset:   0

    BITMAP VERSION 1
    ----------------
    AmtColours: 32
    ByteWidth:  40
    Data:       $1f37f8
    Flags:      None
    LineMod:    200
    MemType:    PRIVATE|VIDEO
    Palette:    $45fa78
    Parent:     $4602a8
    PlaneMod:   40
    Restore:    $4629b8
    Size:       320x256x5
    Total Mem:  51200
    Type:       ILBM

As  you  can  imagine  this  makes  debugging of your objects a lot easier.
Inspector  also allows you to view memory in text or hexadecimal format and
in  future  will  allow  you  to  edit  objects directly.  See the commands
section for further explanation of Inspector's functionality.

@Node "Usage" "How to use Inspector."
@{b}
                                   USAGE
@{ub}

Inspector can only be used from the shell, as follows:

   1.> Inspector

There  are  no special arguments to use.  You will need to run Inspector in
combination  with IceBreaker, because you will need to get object addresses
in order to use the View command (more on this later).

If you have KingCON then it is highly recommended that you make use of this
program to view output when using the CLI, as you will have a scroll bar to
view debug history.

Once  you  run  Inspector,  you  will receive a short message and a command
prompt will appear in the CLI.  Type HELP at any time if you get stuck.

@Node "Commands" "Inspector command list."
@{b}
                                COMMANDS
@{ub}

Inspector allows you to enter the following commands into the console:

  @{b}View <Address>@{ub}
  Views details on a GMS object that is located at the given address.  If
  you supply an incorrect or unrecognisable address, an error is returned.
  Do not type in addresses of objects that have been initialised and then
  Free()ed, as this will give you an error.

  @{b}HexDump <Address> <Length>@{ub}
  Dumps memory data in neatly formatted hex output.  The memory output will
  start at the given Address, and you may specify the byte length, which is
  optional (the default is to dump 208 bytes of data).

  @{b}TextDump <Address> <Length>@{ub}
  This command is identical to HexDump, but it dumps memory data in text
  format.

  @{b}Help@{ub}
  If you can't remember the commands, type "Help" to get a complete list.

  @{b}Quit@{ub}
  Takes you back to AmigaDOS.

Look out for more commands appearing in future versions!
