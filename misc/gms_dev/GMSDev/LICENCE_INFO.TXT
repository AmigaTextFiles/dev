                            GAMES MASTER SYSTEM

                           LICENSING INFORMATION




The Games Master System is not a free project.  It has taken a lot of time
and effort to build, and that effort is still continuing.  In order to keep
this effort of the highest quality, GMS developers are required to pay
license fees for the use of this product.  This money goes back into the
cost of development, so by paying your licence you are giving GMS (and your
programs) a better future.

Before we continue, please consider the following:

* All the development materials necessary to write programs in GMS
  are freely available without restriction.

* System updates are in constant development and become available
  every 1-2 months, for -free-.

* 30% of the existing system code is publicly available, with this to
  rise to 80% by the end of the year.

All of these things were a factor while building the licensing scheme.  A
lot of input was taken from the Questionnaire files, and most people opted
for a licence based method of payment.  If you have any queries then please
write to pmanias@ihug.co.nz with your questions.


How Much?
---------
The following table illustrates how much you will have to pay for a licence
when you want to release a single game.  "The cost of your game" is defined
by the amount of money that a consumer has to pay to buy it.  For example,
if it costs me $10US to buy your program, your licence will cost $20US. 
Once you have your licence you can sell your game for as long as you like,
and are also allowed to distribute the GMS binaries with it.  In the above
case, the licence cost would be recovered after selling just 2 copies of
the program.  Frequent GMS developers are rewarded with lower licence fees.
This is unique to every developer, and I will mail you with some options
after your second licence, or you can ask me about this directly.

Here is the table:

      +-------------------+--------------+ +--------+
      | Program Cost (US) | Licence (US) | | (NZ $) |
      |                   |              | |        |
      |                   | Approximate* | |        |
      +-------------------+--------------+ +--------+
      |                                  | |        |
      |     $0 -  0.00    =     FREE     | |  FREE  |
      |                                  | |        |
      |     $1 - 13.99    =     $20      | |  $35   |
      |                                  | |        |
      |    $14 - 18.99    =     $30      | |  $55   |
      |                                  | |        |
      |    $19 - 23.99    =     $40      | |  $75   |
      |                                  | |        |

      |                                  | |        |
      |    $30 - 34.99    =     $80      | |  $150  |
      |                                  | |        |
      |    $35 - 39.99    =     $120     | |  $225  |

Other Extras
------------
When you apply for your licence, you get sent some added extras.
This includes:

   + Access to any restricted documentation.

   + Keyfiles for Inspector and IceBreaker.

   + Programs costing $14+ get free user registration for 3-6 months
     (NB: Not the full 2 year user registration). 

   + Free publicity and advertising on our web pages.


About Freeware Licences
-----------------------
The good news is that freeware licences are available at no charge.  You
miss out on advantages such as IceBreaker and the excellent Object
Inspector, but at least you don't have to pay me anything if you don't want
to.  Note that you should still write to me about your game, then I can put
you on the registered and news pages.


Important Notes
---------------
If you release a sequel to your game (e.g.  "Super Tetris II") you will
need to renew your license.  Major revisions (e.g.  V2.0) also require new
licences.  Minor revisions (e.g.  V2.1), bug fixes, and patches do not
require you to re-license your game.


You're Charging Me Too Much!
----------------------------
You should be able to recover your license cost after selling only 2 to 4
games.  Keep in mind that all licence fees go towards the continuation of
the project, so by paying the fees you can ensure that GMS has a good
future.

If you want to get a licence at a reduced cost, you can do some work for us
and get one for free.  Some people have one-off licenses and others have
long-term or even licences for life.  People like Julian Boibessot (French
translator) have access to this.  If you want this, you have to help out on
a regular basis.


Failure to Pay Licence Fees
---------------------------
If you release a game without a licence you will face some penalties.  It
not only damages the project, but moves it closer to the PC (I have one
sitting on my desk).

The GMS WWW page contains a listing of all current licences, games released
by each person and so on.  If necessary, we will also run a list of people
that are found to have not paid for licenses.  Since the list is publicly
available, it may be e-mailed to other web pages and newsgroups for
posting.  To be fair to you, we give up to 2 weeks notice if you haven't
paid the licence fee.  After that, you go on the list.

So far this hasn't been necessary, and I look forward to not having to
ever implement this.


Methods of Payment
------------------
Credit card payments are the easiest method - we accept Visa, Mastercard
and Bankcard transactions.  Just print out the mail order form, fill in the
details (make sure that you sign it) and send it in.

You can also register GMS on-line at the web pages, just take your credit
card to "http://hompages.ihug.co.nz/~pmanias/licensing.htm"

Alternatively you can send cash in either US, UK or NZ dollars.  If you are
not sure about the exchange rate in UK or NZ dollars, visit the GMS home
page for correct pricings in these currencies.
