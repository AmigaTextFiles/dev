Hello!

Included in this Package are small demos for TGE, Which will be released
on 15th November 1998. All of these need the GMS_User.lha archive off my webpage or
aminet. Enjoy!

Included Demos:

Moire    -> Port of the origional GMS demo, by Paul Manias
Line     -> Simple Line bouncing around the screen
LineZ    -> Makes a nice pattern out of lines
Snow     -> Origionally by Garfield Benjamin in AMOS, much faster in TGE (still has a bug from the origional one, after
            running for a while it exits.
3DStars  -> Port of the origional amos demo, the moas one did 20stars, this does 500 (and can do 1500 on 060 smoothly ;)
LoadIff  -> A IffPiccy loader, when it loads the piccy, it scroll's it onto the screen
Circle   -> draws a full circle at the mouse's X and Y with radius 12

Please note that TGE still isnt complete and may very well have bugs
esp seen that I changed the screen handling yesterday and havnt tested it much.
Please report all comments to:

Peter Cahill -> cahill4@iol.ie

Thanks!
