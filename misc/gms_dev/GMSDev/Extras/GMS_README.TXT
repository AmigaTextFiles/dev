                              By Paul Manias



The Games Master System is a developers tool that was used in the creation
of this program.  If you do not already have GMS installed on your
machine, you can get it from Aminet:

  ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub/dev/misc/gms_user.lha

And if you are interested in creating your own GMS programs:

  ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/pub/dev/misc/gms_dev.lha

The Games Master System also comes with a preferences program that you can
use to manipulate games to suit your own needs.  You will find this in the
user archive and we highly recommend that you make the most of it.
