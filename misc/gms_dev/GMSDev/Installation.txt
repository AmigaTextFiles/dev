This  step-by-step  installation is for people that don't have the AmigaDOS
Installer program, or if you like to install programs by hand.

NOTE:   Before  installing  the  developer  files  you  must  have  already
installed the gms_user.lha archive on your hard drive.


1. You can copy the GMSDev/ directory to any place on your hard drive,
   but we recommend storing it in the user directory GMS: for easy
   referencing.

2. Open your S:user-startup file and add the lines:

     Assign GMSDev:   <Enter GMSDev location here, eg GMS:GMSDev/>
     Assign INCLUDES: GMSDev:Includes/ ADD

   If you are going to be using the E programming language, also add:

     Assign EModules: GMSDev:EModules/ ADD

3. If you have CygnusEd and are interested in the assembler sources, copy
   Extras/ceddefaults.s to your S: directory.  This will set the correct
   tab stops for the source files (which have a .s extension).

4. Dice C owners must copy GMSDev:Includes/lib/dpk.o and tags.o to DLIB:
