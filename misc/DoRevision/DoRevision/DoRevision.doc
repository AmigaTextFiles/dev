=========================== DoRevision 1.0 ===========================
======================================================================

This  is  a  very  simple  tool  to be used together with DClock.  The
purpose  of  DoRevision  is  to  supply  an  easy way to keep track of
changes  and  updates  inside of 'C' program source codes.  In fact it
creates  revision headers quite similar to the ones to be 'admired' at
the top of every Amiga 'C' header file.  This tools is used internally
at MXM to help us to get 'through' each other's source codes.

=============================== Usage ================================
======================================================================
DoRevision 1.0 operates from CLI only and takes two arguments:

	DoRevision <Source file name> <Log message>

If  DClock  is  running time and date of the current revision are read
from  the  supplied  environment variables.  The following environment
variables are supported but not really required:

AUTHOR ........	Author of the current revision.
COMPANY .......	The company the copyright for this file belongs to.

Please  note  that  these environment variables are Manx type, not the
new  AmigaDOS  type  (yech!).  They can be set using the Manx 'Set' or
the ARP SetEnv command.

The  code is quite portable and should run with minimal changes in any
'C' environment.

DoRevision 1.0 stores a temporary copy of the source file in T:, so be
sure it is assigned anywhere before DoRevision is started.
