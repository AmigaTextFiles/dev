 If you have ever used @{"Mungwall" link "Programs" 0} and @{"Munglist" link "Programs" 0} to find out if your program loses
memory, you will probably know, that these only tell you the amount and sizes of
memory-packets that get lost. They cannot tell you exactly where in your program
you lose the memory.

Now it is possible to execute your program line by line in a debugger. If you start
Munglist after every line, you can find out in which source-line you allocate
memory, which you do not free afterwards.

And thats exactly what findmemloss.cpr does. It is an Arexx-script for @{"cpr" link "Programs" 0} which
executes a function of you program line by line and then tells you in which line
you have allocated the memory, that gets lost.

But be careful: It is written in Arexx and it starts Munglist after every line.
Thus it is very slow... but it works!

 You need an AMIGA personal computer with at least AMIGA OS 2.0 (because you need
Arexx)

 Then you need @{"CodeProbe" link "Programs" 0} from the SAS/C package.

@{" Mungwall" link "Programs" 0} and @{"Munglist" link "Programs" 0} should also reside on your harddisc.

 Thats all.

@node "Using" "Using FindMemLoss"

 Its pretty simple: You start findmemloss.cpr either by typing

@{i}findmemloss NameOfTheFunction@{ui}

in the debug-shell of cpr, or by typing

@{i}rx findmemloss.cpr NameOfTheFunction@{ui}

in a shell.

@{i}NameOfTheFunction@{ui} is the name of the function you want to check. For example
@{i}findmemloss main@{ui} would execute @{i}main@{ui} and afterwards tell you in which line(s) you
lost memory.

Certainly cpr has to be started before that!

If you want to start findmemloss from @{"cpr" link "Programs" 0} you have to copy it to sc:rexx.
FindMemLoss will stop calling @{"Munglist" link "Programs" 0} as soon as the your program leaves the
function you passed as an argument.

Afterwards you have to quit the program. Then FindMemLoss will tell you the results
of its examination.

Note: FindMemLoss.cpr does its output not to cpr´s debug-shell but to the shell
from which you called cpr. So the result of this Arexx-script will normally not
appear on cpr´s screen.

 Like always: I´m not responsible for any damage this program does, the copyright
is mine but you may use it without paying anything to me and if you think you have
to change something write a little note in the source and send it to @{"me!" link "Address" 0}
