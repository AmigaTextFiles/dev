During final testing, I noticed some peculiar behavior with the 16-bit
int version of the library, so I would recommend using the dbug32.lib
version instead, until I have time to resolve the problems.  A quick
scan of the code indicated several possible problem points, such as
having the argument to the Delay() function as an unsigned int (which
is correct for the Unix sleep() "equivalent"), rather than a long int.
