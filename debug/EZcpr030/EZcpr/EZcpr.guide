================================================================

The idea behind EZcpr is to making using the SAS/C debugger(CPR) 
easier to use.  Why have to type in all those variables you want 
to trace, when you can just select them out of a list that is 
automatically generated from your source code?

Essentially, EZcpr will allow you to extract the variable names 
from your source code and then allow you to select which 
variables you want to trace.  You can then save the selections 
to a CPR script file which you can load in to CPR to 
automatically trace the variables you selected.

NOTE: EZcpr is shareware software.  If you find it useful please
      register your copy.  You have 1 month to evaluate it.  If
      after that time you have not registered you should delete 
      it.  Please refer to the @{" How to Register " Link HowToRegister} section of
      this documentation.

@Node Requirements "EZcpr/Requirements"

                          REQUIREMENTS
                          ============ 
     
a) AmigaOS 2.04(or greater)

b) 512Kb free memory is more than enough

c) SAS/C v5.x installed with lc: assigned
If you are using SAS/C v6.x you should assign lc: to sc:c
This is so grep and cxref can be found

d) sort located in the standard c: directory

e) AmigaGuide installed in the System:Utilities directory in 
   order to access the online help system(If you do not have 
   AmigaGuide you can double-click on the EZcpr.doc file to 
   open a MORE window) 
   
f) You must compile your source code using the DEBUG options in 
   order for CPR to be able to trace your variables

@Node Installation "EZcpr/Installation"

                           Installation
                           ============

Copy all the files from the EZcpr disk onto your Harddrive or 
make a duplicate of the EZcpr disk.  NEVER work with original 
disks.

If you are using SAS/C v5.x then ensure lc: is assigned to the
proper directory.  If you are using SAS/C v6.x, add the 
following line to your User-Startup:
assign lc: sc:c
This is necessary so that EZcpr can find grep and cxref.

@Node Usage "EZcpr/Usage"

                              Usage
                              =====

The steps involved in using EZcpr are:

1) Start EZcpr by either:
 
   a) typing EZcpr in a CLI 
OR b) double-clicking with the mouse on the EZcpr icon 

2) The EZcpr screen should now appear

3) Pick CSRC to load in your C source code.  EZcpr will extract 
out your variables and then put them in the NOTRACE list gadget
   
4) To select the variable you want to trace, merely select them 
and select the "->" gadget to place them in the TRACE list gadget
   
5) When you are done selecting variables to trace, select the 
SAVE gadget.  This will write out a <filename>.cpr file which you 
can load into CPR by using the "ex" command.

If you later want to change the variables you want to trace you 
can rerun EZcpr and load in the <filename>.cpr file you created 
with the SAVE option by selecting the EZCPR gadget.

NOTE: There is one other way to load in the variables to trace.  
      If you use the CXREF command that comes with SAS/C, you can 
      create a XREF file.  When doing so use the -x and -n 
      options or else EZcpr will not be able to load the XREF 
      file properly.  After creating the XREF file you can run 
      EZcpr and use the XREF button to load the file.  Using this 
      method, you can create a XREF file with all the variables 
      in your program, even if your program has multiple source 
      files.

@Node VariableFiltering "EZcpr/Variable Filtering"
                         Variable Filtering
                         ==================
                         
When I first started using EZcpr, I noticed that in my programs
I usually had a set of variables that never had to be traced.  I
never wanted to see them listed in neither the NOTRACE nor the 
TRACE lists.  I thus created an option to allow you to have a 
filter file.  Basically this is a file in which you list the 
variables you don't want to see.  It uses the grep command with
the -v option to filter out the lines with the variables you 
list.

Use the FLTR gadget to specify your filter filename.  To have 
EZcpr make use of your filter file you MUST activate the filter 
by turning on the filter checkbox gadget(just click on it with
the mouse, a checkmark will appear)

NOTE: Since it is using the grep command if you put an entry of
      "hi" in the filter file and you have a variable "hipe",
      "hipe" will be filtered out, so be careful what you put
      in the filter file.

                           ==========

1) Start EZcpr by either:

   a) typing EZcpr in a CLI
OR b) double-clicking with the mouse on the EZcpr icon 

2) Select CSRC.  A filerequester should appear.  Select Example.c
Example.c is a small C program that has a few variables you can 
trace.

3) After loading a list of the variables in Example.c should 
appear in the NOTRACE list.

4) Select which variables you want to trace by clicking on them and
then clicking on the "->" gadget to put them in the TRACE list.

5) After you have finished selecting the variables you want select 
the SAVE gadget.

6) Quit out of EZcpr

7) Start up CPR with the Example file

8) Load in the variable file by typing "ex Example.cpr"
The variables you selected will now be traced if you open the trace
window.

1) Run the SAS/C cxref program on Example by typing
"cxref -x -n Example.c > Example.xref"

5) After you have finished selecting the variables you want select 
the SAVE gadget.

6) Quit out of EZcpr

7) Start up CPR with the Example file

8) Load in the variable file by typing "ex Example.cpr"
The variables you selected will now be traced if you open the trace
window.

JUMP - The jump button allows you to move EZcpr from one PUBLICSCREEN 
       to another.  

TOOLTYPES SUPPORTED
===================
PUBSCREEN - can set the default public screen that EZcpr starts on
HEIGHT    - to be done soon

                          Limitations
                          ===========

These 2 limits were just arbitrarily chosen.  If I get people 
registering who would like these limits increased, there would be no
problem doing so. 

-Maximum number of variables allowed after filtering 200
-Maximum number of characters a variable name can be  50
