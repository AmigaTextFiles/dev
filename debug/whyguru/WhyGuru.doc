(1) Introduction

You certainly have already got one of this nasty red blinking bo-
xes to inform you that your computer has crashed. This is the ti-
me where you hate your Amiga.  But what you perhaps don't know is
that she tries to tell you something.
Unfortunately, she does this by giving you the coded cause of the
crash,  coded in an 8-digit-hexadecimal.  But who knows all these
different codes in mind?  So you have to use either a book  where
you look for the specified code or a program  which does the same
for you. Such a program is WhyGuru.

Since the first version in  February '96  I have tried to improve
and to expand this program. Unfortunately :(( version 1.3 got the
victim of a bad disk read/write error  before I have been able to
publish it.
This  version  has  been totally rewritten as the code of earlier
versions has been  (a) a little bit ugly and (b) a little (?) bit
buggy and non-system-conform (except version 1.3).

I would say  you read the manual even  if you are already used to
an older version of WhyGuru since it isn't still the same.


(2) How to start WhyGuru

Running WhyGuru is an easy thing.  Just double-click it's icon on
the workbench or enter its name in a CLI-window.  WhyGuru runs on
any Amiga with at least  512kB RAM and KS1.3 (??), although I had
not the chance to get it tested on other models than my A12oo.

(I doubt that it runs any longer under OS1.3 ??? If anybody could
test this and inform me I would be very pleased.)


(3) The window

You've either the choice to run WhyGuru in a  window or a  shell.
By  using  an  Intuition  window,  the layout looks  a little bit
better. The layout's been created with David Benn's ReqEd.  Using
a shell will give you the same informations (ooops, without s; if
my English teacher would see this ;-),  but just as text. In  the
former case  you need the  thinpaz.font in your FONTS: directory.


(4) Options and tooltypes.

I tried to make  WhyGuru  as  comfortable  to use as possible. As
said above, version 1.3 has been "killed", so many functions have
been gone again ;-(
I  will  try  to add them again in the next version  if anyone is
interested (font sensitivity, set window location, ...).

At the moment there are only three options/tooltypes:

 (a) Only start if there has        CLI : AUTO
     been a guru                    WB  : AUTO=ON/OFF

 This option is for including  WhyGuru  in  your StartUp-Sequence
 or in your WBStartUp drawer,  since it will check  whether there
 was an alert and if there has been none it won't start.
 Furthermore,  WhyGuru  overwrites the last alert code with zeros
 when finished (but _only_ when using "AUTO")  since  if  you are
 going to do a reset via CTRL-LA-RA,  the last code will still be
 in memory and Whyguru would explain it again. By overwriting the
 code this problem is fixed.

 (b) Toggle display                 CLI : WINDOW
                                    WB  : -

 If  WhyGuru  has been launched from a shell,  no  window will be
 opened  but a text will be printed. By using WINDOW WhyGuru will
 not do that but will open the same intuition window as if it has
 been launched from WB.

 (c) Sensitive mode                 CLI : SENSITIVE
                                    WB  : SENSITIVE=ON

 It may be  that you get regularly  crashes  you don't want to be
 shown (i.e. after having made a reset, guru 14041004 [trackdisk.
 device can't open a device]  appears  within  WhyGuru,  although
 EXEC didn't show this guru. This does happen on my 12oo.)
 So you have the possibility to create a file called  WhyGuru.not
 in your  S:  directory where you can specify an unlimited number
 of  guru codes  which won't be displayed anymore  when using the
 sensitive mode.
 The  file's  structure  is  easy.  Lines  starting  with a # are
 comments. A guru number is specified by beginning a new line and
 typing the 8 numbers of it.  There  MUST  be  NO space after the
 number,  otherwise  it  is  ignored.  Just save the file than as
 S:WhyGuru.not and it will be ready for use.

 P.S. : Make sure that there's a free line at the end of the data
        file.

 P.S.S. : When using the SENSITIVE mode and a guru appeared which
          is specified in s:WhyGuru.not, WhyGuru won't start  (as
          if no guru occured and the ALWAYS mode is on).

(6) Known bugs

This bug is no bug (but could lead to misunderstandings):  If you
press the right mouse button  or do a warm reset  when your Amiga
displays an alert, it might be that the guru number is lost !!!!!
Do always "answer" an alert by pressing the left mouse button!

I was told  that the bottom lines of the bevelboxes are sometimes
destroyed.  This did NOT happen on my A5oo  but since I am having
my new 12oo :-))))) I have also been able to watch this -> fixed.

Another problem could be the position of the guru number in memo-
ry. It should be in ExecBase->LastAlert. Curious, but this is not
the case on my A12oo. Here it is at $100 (interrupt vector). This
version  does  read its value from $100  as I have not heard  any
complaint until now  (1.x versions got it from $100 as well).  If
WhyGuru does not work on your machine, please, contact me!

As to my knowledge  there are no more bugs,  but one can never be
sure. So if you find one -> my address can be found below.




(7) Future features

Well,  I'd like to hear YOUR ideas  and I want your help.  If you
have any idea,  suggestion  or even bug reports,  improvements or
adding or better explanations for alert codes  please contact me.

And what  I really need are texts for a <Detailed>¹ function.  So
if you can explain an alert code in no more words than fitting on
a HiRes screen  with Topaz 8,  perhaps with some typical examples
which cause such a guru in ACE, Assembler and/or C PLEASE!!! tell
me!

                                    ¹ I thought of a button which
                                      will deliver more! than one
                                      line of explanation. When I
                                      have enough texts, I'll add
                                      this feature.


(8) History

version  date      description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1.00     16-02-96  first try
         18-02-96  finished
1.10     20-02-96  removed 2 awful bugs : in the developed source
                   I forgot a }  and all hexadecimal codes in the
                   data lines were handled as decimal :(
1.20     12-03-96  created window layout with ReqEd1.11s by David
                   Benn, so that WhyGuru can now be launched from
                   the workbench.
1.21     16-03-96  How could that happen!?  I have just found out
                   that there is _again_ an awful bug: instead of
                   the subsystem the detailed explanation code is
                   printed :((( Fixed.
         17-03-96  Added feature to change the font for  display-
                   ing the explanation texts
1.22     13-05-96  Added 39 (!) new explanations. Found in books'
         14-05-96  appendices and in other guru programs.
1.30     15-05-96  Created new layout
         19-05-96  added the "new alert code" gadget but had some
         20-05-96  problems converting the input
         26-05-96  fixed also some problems with the graphics
         27-05-96  optimizing
         28-05-96  wrote manual
         29-05-96  lost the whole source -> the only survivors
                   were the manual and the ReqEd file :-(
                   Perhaps I should not have used NoName disks ?
                   I am happy to have a harddisk now :-))
2.00     28-03-97  Rewrote the whole source
         31-03-97  After having had a nice Easter weekend I fixed
                   some bugs and wrote the manual.  Furthermore I
                   added some more (30) alert codes ;-)
         04-04-97  Added the AUTO function
         05-04-97  Fixed a bug when reading the tooltypes
         03-05-97  Fixed a bug.
         05-05-97  Fixed a bug  (actually a bug in  NAP  but this
                   lead to some unprocessed defines  and ACE just
                   put some random value in these "variables")
         08-05-97  Added the sensitive function.
         15-05-97  Fixed a bug in the sensitive function.
