This little program tries to tell you why your Amiga has crashed,
e.g. what these cryptic guru numbers really mean. Right now there
are about 128 guru codes implemented.

WhyGuru can be launched either from shell or workbench  and opens
therefore either a window or print to standard output.

More features:          - "SENSITIVE" mode: Don't display certain
                          alerts
                        - "AUTO" mode: Do only run when there has
                          been a guru  (ideal for use within your
                          user-startup or in WBStartUp !!!)

Requirements:           - an Amiga
                        - workbench's thinpaz.font

Please read the manual carefully! I hope you'll like this program
and I hope it will help you.
