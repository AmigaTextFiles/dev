@node intro "BugAdvisor / What does it do ?"


Even if we care for every single byte of our source codes, as far as we are human, 
it's normal that our executables suffer of bugs and imperfections.

BugAdvisor gives us an hand because it can output well-made ASCII bug report forms in
a very intuitive and simple way.The report can be sent later with email tools or 
just by snail mail.

It can be called from inside the program itself (this was the original idea) or just 
from Workbench

@node config "BugAdvisor / What does it need ?"

In order to use BugAdvisor you need :

1)   OS 2.0 at least
2)   'ED' tool (distributed with the system disks)
3)   Very little RAM

@endnode

@node usage "BugAdvisor / How to use it ?"

There are two methods for calling up BugAdvisor:

1)   USER      method
2)   DEVELOPER method

The difference between one and the other is very little and simple: the first one 
consists in accessing the tool from WB, which implies TOOLTYPE reading ; the second
one consists in accessing the executable from inside a SHELL process, which implies
ARGUMENT parsing.

But why have I called these two ways 'USER' and 'DEVELOPER' ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reason is very simple. Every developer can call BugAdvisor with SystemTagList()
function (dos.library). Let's have a look to this AmigaE example:

___________________________________________________________________________________
PROC main()

DEF       my_executable[50]:STRING,
          myself[50]:STRING,
          argument[100]:STRING

StrCopy(my_executable,'BugAdvisor 1.3 ',ALL)
StrCopy(myself,'Riccardo ',ALL)
StrCopy(argument,'BugAdvisor ',ALL)
StrAdd(argument,myexecutable,ALL)
StrAdd(argument,myself,ALL)        -> arg is 'BugAdvisor "BugAdvisor 1.3" Riccardo'

SystemTagList(argument,NIL)        -> Let's call BugAdvisor !
ENDPROC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see this is more developer oriented. Nevertheless everyone can call the tool
from inside a Shell process , with the syntax:

BugAdvisor PROGRAM-NAME/A AUTHOR/A

If you want to use the executable from WB, set the tooltypes in BugAdvisor icon:

EXECUTABLE=<name of the program with a bug>
AUTHOR=<name of the author of the program with a bug>



Simple, isn't it ?!?

@node afc "Amiga Foundation Classes"

AMIGA FOUNDATION CLASSES

What are the Amiga Foundation Classes

"Amiga Foundation Classes" (AFC from now on) is the name of a library of
Object Classes designed to manage the several features of Amiga.  Each
Class will constitute an interface between the programmer and a particular
aspect of the Amiga Operating System, trying to make the design and the
coding of a program for the Amiga OS computers easier.  The AFC have been
also designed to assure a quicker porting of the Amiga programs on the
future Amiga-Compatible Operating Systems.  See section 2.4 for more infos.

What are the Amiga Foundation Classes for

We have designed the AFC for different reasons:  first of all the necessity
of fully exploiting the object oriented programming (OOP), that allows to
"recycle" code using it in other Classes or in other programs.  The
recompilation of the AFC on future computers with an Amiga-Compatible OS
will allow a quicker porting of software products. See section 2.4 for more
infos.

Who will use the Amiga Foundation Classes

The AFC will be available to all programmers using a language supporting
the OOP.  The AFC can be used freely in FreeWare, ShareWare, PD or
Commercial programs without paying any royalty.  Probably, in the final
version of the (C)Copyright of the AFC we will ask to programmers that use
them in their code to include a message of the form "This program uses the
AFC", but we have not decided it yet.

Future of the Amiga Foundation Classes

The AFC have been designed to warrant a reliable base of Objects to be used
in the future Amiga-Compatible machines:  by recompiling the AFC source
code will be possible to obtain an excellent library of Classes with which
one can easily build applications for the new computers.  The advantage of
using Classes of objects over the Operating System calls is due to the fact
that such Classes work as an "interface" between the OS and the programmer:
people that programmed on the Amiga using the AFC will bring their code on
the new machines by simply recompiling the sources and using the AFC
version implemented on the new computer on which they are working.  Thank
to the AFC, programmers will save a lot of time (otherwise spent in
learning the new OS) and will keep on using the same Classes with the same
sintax and the same behaviour.  This implies, at least in our intentions,
that the software will be developed better and in a shorter time.  The risk
that every new Operating System has to face, when it first comes to life,
is the lack of professional software.  Thank to the AFC it will be possible
to provide in brief time professional products for these new OS.

Interfacing with new Amiga OS Compatibles

It's our intention to freely supply developers of Amiga-Compatible OS with
the source code of the AFC, be they Phase5, VisCorp, Be Inc., AROS, p-OS,
PIOS, etc.  Indeed, we are persuaded that the future of a new machine,
possibly not depending on Microsoft, is to be found in the possibility of
having in a short time software products of a professional quality.  Thus
the AFC sources will be provided to every OS developer that will ask for
them.  Then the particular implementation will be examined by the
supervisors of AFC that will give their approval and allow the
distribution.  See section 5.0 for more infos.
