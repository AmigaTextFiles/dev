1. Purpose

This small file handler was written to help debugging the Amiga "Samba" port.
With its help you can have debug output that normally goes to a file sent
through the usual debug output channel, where it can be captured with tools
such as "Sashimi". The point of having debug output delivered this way is that
you can see "Enforcer" hits show up along with whatever debugging information
the software throwing the hits may produce all by itself.


2. Installation

I have provided a mount file ("Debug") and the file handler itself
("debug-handler"). These should be copied into the following directories on your
SYS: partition:

   Debug         -> "DEVS:DOSDrivers" (or "Storage/DOSDrivers")
   debug-handler -> "L":

When finished, use "Mount DEBUG:" to activate the 


3. Source code

Complete source code for SAS/C is provided ("Source_Code") and should build cleanly
if you enter "smake".
