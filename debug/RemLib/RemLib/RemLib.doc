                             written 1992

                                by H.P.G


RemLib is a OS 2.0 only Tool, that means it doesn`t run under OS 1.2 und 1.3 .

RemLib is a simple CLI-program which tries to close resident
libraries softly (system-conform).


Legal Stuff:


        This program and all files come with it also the docfiles are released
        as PUBLIC DOMAIN.

        this means:

            everybody may use it, modify it and (re)distribute it.
            It would be very nice to include a notice about the original author.

        I take no warranty or garanty for the function of this program.
        The whole risk of using it stays by the user.


The name(s) you give to RemLib are casesensitive.

If RemLib doesn`t find the given library, you get a message.

If RemLib finds it, it will ask Exec to close the library.
If no other program is still using these libraries they will be closed.

RemLib has the following cli

Syntax: RemLib LibName/M/A

This means you can specify multiples library names.
If RemLib have closed a library it puts a message to the cli.
If the library could not be found or the library could not be closed,
it will also inform you.

Technical:

       RemLib is written with the Manx Aztec 5.2a Compiler. remLib uses the ReadArgs and
       the FindName functions.

Have fun ...
