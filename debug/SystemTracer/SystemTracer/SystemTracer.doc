	SystemTracer V1.0
	-----------------
	a tool for viewing and editing the Amiga system structures
	written in 1990 by Guido Burkard


1. How to start the SyTra
-------------------------
To start the SyTra, just type its name in the CLI. To start SyTra in the
background, type "run SystemTracer -bg". The SyTra "sleeps" now until you
hit the HELP key.
Note: The SyTra will automatically notice whether you're Amiga is running
with the NTSC (USA,200 pixels y) or the PAL (Europe, 256 pixels y)
resolution and will open its window fitting in the Workbench Screen.

2. How to use the SyTra
-----------------------
When the SyTra is started, it opens its own window and you can see the ">>"
prompt. Now you can enter commands. Here's a summary of SyTra's commands:

l	List structure		List current structure:
				The title tells you the type and the name
				of the structure. The following structure
				listing	contains (from left to right):
				- absolute address (hexadecimal)
				- relative structure offset (hex)
				- number of the structure entry (decimal)
				- type and name of the entry
				  (if the entry is a member of an array,
				   there is also the array index)
				- content of the entry
				After starting SyTra, "ExecBase" is the
				current	structure. You can pause the output
				by holding down the CTRL key and stop the
				output by hitting the SHIFT key.

n	New(next) structure	Jump to a structure named or pointed at
				in the current structure. SyTra will ask
				you for the entry number (and for the
				index if it's an array). You can look up
				entry numbers in the structure listing
				(command l). If you enter a number which
				doesn't belong to a structure, SyTra will
				produce an error message. 

p	Previous structure	SyTra remembers the path on which you went
				to the current structure. With the p
				command you go one step back on the path.
				If you are yet at the place where you began,
				SyTra will produce an error message.

o	Open lib/get base	With this command you can begin a new path 
				through the structures starting at one of
				the following structures:
				- ExecBase  - IntuitionBase  - GfxBase

s	System hex/dec		Change from one system to the other:
				- hexadecimal  - decimal
				Note: Addresses, offset and memory para-
				meters are always shown and entered in hex.

e	Edit entry		Change the value of an entry in the current
				structure. You have to enter the entry
				number and - if you want to change the
				member of an array - the array index (also
				shown in the structure listing).
				If you want to change whole structures,
				you have to enter every part of the
				structure (and also sub-structures, 
				sub-sub-structures, and so on).
				If you want to change structure pointers,
				there are several possibilities:
				- a allocate
				Allocate new memory for the structure,
				enter the new structure and set the
				pointer on it. If you want to allocate
				memory, SyTra will always ask you for the
				memory parameters. This is the same number
				as AllocMem needs.
				(e.g. $02 for CHIP-memory)
				- o overwrite
				Write over the existing structure being
				pointed at.
				- p point
				Just set the pointer at any place in the
				memory, where there is yet such a structure.

w	Write structure		Write any structure anywhere in the memory.
				SyTra will ask you for the structure name.
				It will do if you enter just the first few
				letters of the structure's name if there's
				no other one beginning with the same
				letters.
 				Note: SyTra differs between capital and
				small letters!
				- o overwrite
				Just write anywhere in the memory
				(use carefully!)
				- a allocate
				Allocate memory and write structure there.

r	Read structure		Read any structure from anywhere in the
				memory.

f	Free structure		Free structure's memory which you wrote 
				(allocate mode) before to the memory.

t	Type string to memory	Same as "Write structure" but for strings.

u	Untype (free) string	Same as "Free structure" but for strings.

m	Monitor memory		Hex monitor listing
				hold down CTRL to pause
				hit SHIFT to stop

x,q	Exit (Quit)		Terminate SyTra

c	Close window		Closes the SyTra window but keeps running
				in the background (exactly as if you'd
				have started SyTra with the "-bg" option).
				Hit HELP to re-open window.			

h,?	Help			Command help
				Gives a short summary of the SyTra commands.

d	Disk operations		A list of disk functions will be shown and 
				the "disk>>" prompt will be shown.
				You can either select one of the functions
				by typing its shorthand or exit the disk
				operations menu by just hitting ENTER.
				- s save structure
				saves a structure from memory to disk
				- l load structure
				loads a structure saved with the save
				operation into memory
				- a save as Assembler code
				translates a structure into assembler
				source code and saves it as ASCII to disk
				note: certain pointers and structures have
				to be filled in afterwards by the user
				- c save as C code
				translates a structure into C source code
				and saves it as ASCII to disk
				note: certain pointers and structures have
				to be filled in afterwards by the user
				- m save memory
				saves a part of the memory to disk
				- e load memory
				loads a file into memory

3. Notes
--------
a) Be careful with this tool. It's easy to cause system crashes with it...

b) The m (monitor) command is a bit slow. Sorry for that...

c) I wrote this tool under Kickstart 1.2, so it may cause troubles
   under V1.3, and I'm quite sure that it won't work under V2.0...

d) This program is Public Domain and may be freely distributed.

e) Critics and contributions are welcome, write to:
