S.I.M. v1.72 - System-Independent Monitor
Copyright © by Stefan Walter, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED
-------------------------------------------------


This version of SIM is not official. It was released and initially put
on the FTP site amiga.physik.unizh.ch because some programers I know
have requested an update and because all developers of Amiga Mach shall
have access to it as long as the Mach debugger can't be used. However, I
encourage everybody else to have a look at this debugger and use it.

I don't accept any responsability for functionality, bug freeness etc.
If neccessary, regular updates will be available on amiga.physik.unizh.ch.

The distribution contains:
