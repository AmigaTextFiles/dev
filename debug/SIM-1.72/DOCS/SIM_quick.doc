                         SIM - QUICK DOCUMENTATION
                         -------------------------

This  is a very short description of the most important features of SIM and
how  to  use  them.   It's intended for htose users who just want to have a
glance at it to see if they can use it and don't want to read all the other
documentations.   If  you want to know about more advanced features, you'll
need to read the big documentation anyway.


Basic monitor commands:


       m (s)(e)        Displays a hexdump from (s) to (e)

       d (s)(e)        Disasembles memory from (s) to (e)

       r (r)(x)        Displays register or sets register (r) to value (x)

       z               Executes a trace step

       u               Executes a trace step but does not enter sub routines

       b (s)           Lists or sets/clears a breakpoint at address (s)

       e (s)           Edit memory at (s)

       n (s)           Assembly to memory at (s)

       x/X             Leaves SIM


By pressing <ESC> a part of the display is used to display registers and
one or two views containing a dump of the memory. Control of this 'window'
is done with left or right Amiga shortcuts:


       AMIGA+<m>       Chooses hexdump as output form of view

       AMIGA+<d>       Chooses disassembly as output form of view

       AMIGA+<b>       Sets a breakpoint at start address of view

       AMIGA+<z>       Trace step

To scroll in the view use AMIGA+<cursor> and AMIGA+SHIFT+<cursor>. F1 and F2
can also used to trace.
