                     CHANGES AND BUGFIXES since v1.70
                     ================================





SIM v1.71 distribution:
=======================


SIM:

	- If access scan was sucessful, wrong text was printed in 68000
	  version. Bug fixed.

	- Amiga-Z Shortcut to enable EA calculation while tracing and
	  for condition BKPTs.


SIMBug:

	- Under 68000 an address error happenend when an old copy of
	  SIM was found at startup. That's what happens when you develop
	  under 68030 :). Bug fixed.


bug.libfile30:

	- The definitions for dos.library were wrong from the vector Cli().
	  Bug fixed.






SIM v1.72 distribution:
=======================


SIM:

	- The delay value for the handshake in the keyboard routine was
	  too small for certain accellerated A2000B models. The delay 
	  value is now individually calculated to ensure a delay of
	  85 microseconds.

	- Performance calculation failed on 68040 because of prefetch
	  problems with RTE, causing all disk commands not to work. 
	  Bug fixed.

	- Enable/disable function key shortcuts printed wrong text for
	  F10. Bug fixed.

	- Interrupt lockup problem solved! If either interrupt level 2
	  or level 3 locks up because of an interrupt request from an
	  external device (i.e. a harddisk controler), SIM will now
	  automatically exit, execute the corresponding interrupt
	  handler and return through the JSR entrance.

	- Bug in assembler fixed. MOVEM <EA>,<REGLIST> was disassembled
	  to a location 4 bytes above the desired destination.

	- SIM will now wait until blitter DMA has finished before disabling
	  it. Stopping the blitter in the middle of its work caused problems
	  in certain situations.

	- Some command's output didn't send a <CR> when the printer was on.
	  Bug fixed.

	- Debugger window open by default now.


SIMBug:

	- If SIM was quitted from the wrong process, a requester is now
	  displayed, leaving the choice to either continue or to suspend
	  the process.


PostSIM:

	- Added task list command.

	- Added task interception feature.

	- Problem with task traphandlers solved. In earlier versions it
	  happened that when PostSIM terminated, it attempted to restore
	  the traphandlers of tasks which already didn't exist any more.

	- Some general improvements done. :)
