What is MMS ?
*************

   MUI-MemSnap (short: MMS) is a tool to show the usage of mem and to
generate low memory situations.

   MMS snaps the current situation of mem, ChipMem, FastMem, TotalMem
and another kinds of mem (see EXTENDED at Arguments & Items). It
displays the usage in relation to the snap. These snaps are listed in a
listview, so many different snaps can be generated.

   A snap uses two lines in the listview, the first one contains a
little rectangle at begin of line and shows the snaped memory values.
The second displays the difference between the actual and the frozen
memory snap, that means the used memory is shown.

   While in allocator mode (see ALLOCATOR at Arguments & Items) there
are two sliders, one for ChipMem the other for FastMem, here you can
allocate mem in steps of 10KB. To produce a low memory situation put
the sliders to the right, almost all mem is allocated, only if the
largest mem block is greater than 10KB.
