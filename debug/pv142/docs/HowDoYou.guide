@Node PVScreenToLace "How Do You ... ? : Set the PowerVisor screen to interlace"
The easiest way to do this is the following sequence of commands :

< mode lace <enter>
< fit main <enter>
< saveconfig <enter>

See the appropriate documentation for more information (@{" mode " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Mode"}, @{" fit " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Fit"}
and @{" saveconfig " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Saveconfig"}).

@Node StartDebuggingAProgram "How Do You ... ? : Start debugging a program"
The easiest way to start debugging is by using the standard @{" fdebug " Link "pv:docs/Aliases.guide/Fdebug"}
alias (this alias is defined in the PowerVisor-startup file). This alias
opens the source and debug windows and redefines some keys so that you
can easily singlestep in your programs (the defined keys are like the
keys used by the 'monam' (© HiSoft) debugger). The 'fdebug' alias will
show all the keys that are defined. The 'fdebug' alias opens the
source window. This window is only used for sourcelevel debugging.
If you don't need this you can close this window with the @{" swin " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Swin"}
command.

After opening the fullscreen debugger with 'fdebug' you also need to
load the program. For programs intended to be started from the Shell
or CLI you can use :

< debug l <programname> <enter>

It's better not to use this command if you have AmigaDOS 1.3 since the
1.3 version of PowerVisor does not create a CLI structure for the loaded
program.

The best way to load a program (in case you have AmigaDOS 1.3 or
if you want to debug a WorkBench program) is with :

< debug n <enter>

PowerVisor will now wait for the next program. With this command it is
possible to debug WorkBench programs. After typing 'debug n' you can
double click on an icon and PowerVisor will intercept the program.
Note that you can't debug resident programs!

Because 'debug n' does not load the symbols ('debug l' does) you have
to load them yourselves :

< symbol l <programname> <enter>

If you want to load the source (for sourcelevel debugging) you must
use the following command (also for 'debug l') :

< source l <programname> <enter>

Note that you can only use sourcelevel debugging if you have compiled
or assembled your program with special options (these options depend
on your compiler or assembler).


See @{" Debugging " Link "pv:docs/Debug.guide/Main"} for additional information about debugging.

@Node InterruptPowerVisorOutput "How Do You ... ? : Interrupt PowerVisor output"
Normally you can interrupt PowerVisor output with the <esc> key. You can
redefine the interrupt key to another key but <esc> is the default. See
the @{" prefs " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Prefs"} command for more information about redefining standard keys.

@Node RestorePowerVisorAfterARexxError "How Do You ... ? : Restore PowerVisor after ARexx error"
Normally ARexx scripts started from within PowerVisor (with the @{" rx " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Rx"}
command) run asynchronously with PowerVisor. This means that you can still
type commands on the PowerVisor commandline while the ARexx script is
running. However, it is possible that an ARexx script wants complete
control over PowerVisor and the commandline. In that case this script will
probably use @{" sync " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Sync"} to synchronize PowerVisor to the script. After the
script is done it will use @{" async " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Async"} to restore PowerVisor. But, for one
reason or another, it is possible that the ARexx script 'forgets' to use
the 'async' command (because of a bug or because the ARexx script is
interrupted). PowerVisor has no way to know that the ARexx script is ready
so the PowerVisor commandline will remain locked forever. You can solve
this problem by sending an 'async' command from the Shell or CLI
commandline like this :

Cli< rx "address rexx_powervisor async" <enter>
