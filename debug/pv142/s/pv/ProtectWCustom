;Little script to protect the write-only values in the custom chips
;for reads. Note that you must use the 'watch' command before you
;use this script
;
;Note that it is rather dangerous to modify the values used in this
;script. Only do this if you are VERY VERY sure that you know what
;you are doing!!!
;
;Also note that this script causes a VERY big slowdown of important
;system features. Don't do any diskwrites or other potentially harmful
;things while you are using this protection
;
;You can use this script in combination with 'ProtectRCustom' which
;only protects the read-only values. But you must first use 'ProtectRCustom'
;before you use this script
