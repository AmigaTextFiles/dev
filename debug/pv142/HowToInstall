Installation for AmigaDOS 2.0 or 3.0
------------------------------------

   If you have a harddisk (and about 3 megabytes free) the easiest way to
   install PowerVisor is to make a subdirectory named 'PowerVisor' and
   extract the PowerVisor archive in that subdirectory. After that
   double click on the 'InstallPV' icon and installation (with many
   confirm options) will start (in another subdirectory). After
   installation simply remove the 'PowerVisor' subdirectory. (Note
   that you must have the 'Installer' program (© Commodore) to use
   the 'InstallPV' script. If you don't have this program you must use
   the manual installation method described below).

   If you don't have a harddisk or you don't have enough free harddisk
   space, but you do have a lot of memory you can also make the
   'PowerVisor' subdirectory on your RAM: disk and repeat the above
   procedure.

   If you don't have a harddisk and you don't have enough memory you
   can make use of the fact that the 'Docs' and 'PVDevelop' subdirectories
   need not be on the same disk or volume as the rest of the PowerVisor
   archive. You can easily put 'Docs', 'PVDevelop' or both on another
   disk or volume. The install script will notice the missing subdirectories
   and will ask for the other disk. Please remember that you MUST use
   the subdirectories on these other disks even if the disk only contains
   one sort of files. Thus, the disk with the manual MUST contain
   a 'Docs' subdirectory containing all the manual files.
   Warning! Please give each disk you use another name, otherwise there
   might be problems.


Manual installation for AmigaDOS 2.0 or 3.0
-------------------------------------------

   If you don't have 'Installer' or you want to install PowerVisor manually
   (because you distrust my install script) you must install PowerVisor
   manually. Just perform the following steps one by one. Not all steps
   are needed. The advantages of all steps are explained below.
   Note that I assume that your harddisk or disk is called 'work:'. If this
   is not the case just replace 'work:' by the correct name everywhere in
   these steps. Also note that some installation techniques are recommended
   above others. The recommended method is always the one that is also
   compatible with the 1.3 version of PowerVisor unless otherwise noted.

   To install a minimal PowerVisor execute the following steps :

      o The best way is probably to make a subdirectory (called 'PV' for
        example) where you can put all PowerVisor files.
        Add the following line to your S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence :

            assign pv: work:pv

      o Make a subdirectory called 'c' in the 'PV' subdirectory and put
        the 'pv' executable there.

      o Adjust your path or let c: assign to that subdirectory (with the
        AmigaDOS 2.0 multiple assign feature) like this
        (add to S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence) :

            path pv:c add      (recommended)

        or

            assign c: pv:c add

      o Copy the 'powervisor.library' to your LIBS: directory (recommended)
        or make a subdirectory 'libs' in the 'PV' subdirectory and put the
        library there. In the last case you must also use the multiple assign
        feature like this (add to S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence) :

            assign libs: pv:libs add

   You now have a minimal installation of PowerVisor. This is just enough
   to run PowerVisor, but you will have no online help, no error messages
   (only numbers), no manual, no examples, no PowerVisor-startup file
   (containing useful PowerVisor extensions), no menus, no reqtools
   requesters (unless you already have reqtools), ...

   Use the following step(s) if you want online help, error messages and
   menus :

      o Copy the following files to the same directory where you put the
        executable ('pv') (recommended if you plan to use PowerVisor only
        in AmigaDOS 2.0) or put them in your S: subdirectory (only
        recommended if you plan to use PowerVisor in AmigaDOS 1.3 now and
        then) :

            PowerVisor-help.qq  (or PowerVisor-help)
            PowerVisor-ctrl
            PowerVisor-menus
            PowerVisor-errors

        All files ending with '.qq' are compressed. Use the 'dc' utility
        in the archive to decompress them like this :

            dc PowerVisor-help.qq PowerVisor-help 4
            delete PowerVisor-help.qq

        You won't need the 'dc' utility for anything else. Delete it when
        you are ready with it (after the installation, you may need it
        once more for parts of the manual).

   Use the following step(s) if you want to use reqtools requesters in
   PowerVisor (some of the PowerVisor-scripts and some of the menus use
   these requesters. If reqtools.library (© Nico François) is not available,
   PowerVisor uses very primitive replacements) :

      o Copy 'reqtools.library' to LIBS: (recommended) or to the same place
        you put 'powervisor.library'. Note that you must make sure that you
        don't overwrite a more recent version of reqtools. Check the version
        with the following commands :

            version reqtools.library

        and

            (first make sure that the reqtools.library from the PowerVisor
            archive is in RAM:)
            lha x pv.lha libs/reqtools.library ram: (or something like this)
            version ram:reqtools.library file

        If the second version is more recent you should copy the newer
        reqtools.library over the old one (probably somewhere in LIBS:)

   When PowerVisor starts it will execute the S:PowerVisor-startup file if
   this file exists. The PowerVisor-startup file from the archive is rather
   useful and installs some nice new commands and features. It is highly
   recommended. Note that you should also install all example PowerVisor
   scripts if you install the PowerVisor-startup file because some of these
   example scripts are used in the startup script.

      o Copy 'PowerVisor-startup' to your S: directory (recommended)
        or make a subdirectory 's' in the 'PV' subdirectory and put the
        file there. In the last case you must also use the multiple assign
        feature like this (add to S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence) :

            assign s: pv:s add

      o Make a subdirectory 'pv' somewhere in S:
        Note that it is best to put all PowerVisor scripts (except the
        PowerVisor-startup script) in 'S:pv' because then you don't need
        to type this pathname when you use the 'script' command (PowerVisor
        automatically looks in that subdirectory)

      o Put all example scripts from the archive (in subdirectory 's/pv')
        in that new subdirectory

      o The included PowerVisor-startup file also needs FD: assigned to
        the subdirectory containing your fd-files. Fd-files are files
        containing information about Amiga library functions. If you don't
        have these files (note that you can find the AmigaDOS 1.3 fd-files
        on the Extras 1.3 disk) you must delete the four lines in the
        PowerVisor-startup file starting with '-lfd', otherwise add
        the following line to your S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence :

            assign fd: <subdir for fd-files>

   Execute the following steps to install the manual (which can also be
   used as an enhanced online help file if you have MultiView
   (© Commodore) :

      o Make a subdirectory called 'docs' in the 'PV' subdirectory (this
        place is only important if you plan to use MultiView. MultiView
        will look for the documentation in 'pv:docs')

      o Copy all files from the archive (the complete 'docs' subdirectory)
        to the new 'docs' subdirectory

      o It is possible that the 'CommandRef.guide' file is compressed
        (to make it possible that the manual fits on one old filesystem
        disk). If this is the case it will be named 'CommandRef.guide.qq'.
        Decompress it with the 'dc' utility like this :

            dc CommandRef.guide.qq CommandRef.guide 4
            delete CommandRef.guide.qq

        You won't need the 'dc' utility for anything else. Delete it when
        you are ready with it

      o If you have MultiView you can use it to read the documentation.
        You can also start MultiView from within PowerVisor (with 'ahelp',
        'cmdhelp' and 'funhelp') so you have a magnificent online help
        environment. If this is the case you can delete the following
        files :

            ConvertGuide2Doc
            ConvertGuide2Doc.c
            doc.info
            ConvertDoc.script

      o If you don't have MultiView but you don't mind the MultiView
        commands in the manual you can also delete the previous files
        like in the previous step

      o If you don't have MultiView and you want to convert the manual
        to a more readable (readable with a normal textviewer, that is)
        format you must follow the following procedure :

            cd pv:docs
            for each #?.guide file do

               ConvertGuide2Doc #?.guide #?.doc (don't use wildcards,
                                                replace with correct
                                                filename)
               delete #?.guide
               delete #?.guide.info
               copy doc.info #?.doc.info

        After this you can delete the four files like in the previous
        steps

      o The 'docs' subdirectory also contains a 'searchit' program. This
        program is used by the 'index' alias defined in the
        PowerVisor-startup file. If you have the 'ixemul.library' it is
        probably best to replace 'searchit' by 'searchit.gcc' because
        this version is much faster and shorter :

               copy searchit.gcc searchit

        You can delete 'searchit.lc' and 'searchit.gcc' after that.
        You can also delete 'searchit.c' if you don't want to look
        at the source

   There are some additional utilities that you can use to enhance some
   features of PowerVisor. Execute the following steps to install them :

      o If you want to change the online help (PowerVisor-help) you need
        the 'QuickHelp' utilities. Copy the following files in the same
        subdirectory where the 'pv' executable is located :

            MakeHelp
            ArcFiles
            Help

      o If you want to make your own structure files (see the 'addstruct'
        command) you must copy the 'MStruct' utility in the same
        subdirectory where the 'pv' executable is located

   If you also want to run PowerVisor in AmigaDOS 1.3 (or 1.2) you must
   also copy the 1.3 versions of all executable programs. All 1.3 versions
   have the same name extended with 13.

      o Copy the wanted files to the same subdirectory as 'pv' :

            pv13
            MStruct13
            MakeHelp13
            ArcFiles13
            Help13

   If you want you can also copy the additional 'Examples', 'Source' and
   'PVDevelop' subdirectories. PowerVisor does not need these. They are
   for your information only.

   This concludes the manual installation for AmigaDOS 2.0.


Manual installation for AmigaDOS 1.3 (or 1.2)
---------------------------------------------

   Follow these steps if you want to install PowerVisor for AmigaDOS 1.3.
   Just perform the following steps one by one. Not all steps are needed.
   The advantages of all steps are explained below.
   Note that I assume that your harddisk or disk is called 'work:'. If this
   is not the case just replace 'work:' by the correct name everywhere in
   these steps. Also note that some installation techniques are recommended
   above others. Note that if you install PowerVisor like described below
   you will not be able to run PowerVisor in AmigaDOS 2.0. If you want
   to use PowerVisor in AmigaDOS 2.0 and AmigaDOS 1.3 at the same time you
   must follow the AmigaDOS 2.0 installation procedure.

   To install a minimal PowerVisor execute the following steps :

      o The best way is probably to make a subdirectory (called 'PV' for
        example) where you can put all PowerVisor files.
        Add the following line to your S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence :

            assign pv: work:pv

      o Make a subdirectory called 'c' in the 'PV' subdirectory and put
        the 'pv13' executable there (if you want you can rename it to
        'pv')

      o Adjust your path like this  (add to S:user-startup or
        S:startup-sequence) :

            path pv:c add

      o Copy the 'powervisor.library' to your LIBS: directory

   You now have a minimal installation of PowerVisor. This is just enough
   to run PowerVisor, but you will have no online help, no error messages
   (only numbers), no manual, no examples, no PowerVisor-startup file
   (containing useful PowerVisor extensions), no reqtools requesters
   (unless you already have reqtools), ...

   Use the following step(s) if you want online help, error messages and
   menus :

      o Copy the following files to S:

            PowerVisor-help.qq  (or PowerVisor-help)
            PowerVisor-ctrl
            PowerVisor-errors

        All files ending with '.qq' are compressed. Use the 'dc' utility
        in the archive to decompress them like this :

            dc PowerVisor-help.qq PowerVisor-help 4
            delete PowerVisor-help.qq

        You won't need the 'dc' utility for anything else. Delete it when
        you are ready with it (after the installation, you may need it
        once more for parts of the manual).

   Use the following step(s) if you want to use reqtools requesters in
   PowerVisor (some of the PowerVisor-scripts use these requesters. If
   reqtools.library (© Nico François) is not available, PowerVisor uses
   very primitive replacements) :

      o Copy 'reqtools.library' to LIBS:
        Note that you must make sure that you don't overwrite a more recent
        version of reqtools. Check the version with the following commands :

            version reqtools.library

        and

            (first make sure that the reqtools.library from the PowerVisor
            archive is in RAM:)
            lha x pv.lha libs/reqtools.library ram: (or something like this)
            type ram:reqtools.library opt h

        If the second version is more recent you should copy the newer
        reqtools.library over the old one (in LIBS:)

   When PowerVisor starts it will execute the S:PowerVisor-startup file if
   this file exists. The PowerVisor-startup file from the archive is rather
   useful and installs some nice new commands and features. It is highly
   recommended. Note that you should also install all example PowerVisor
   scripts if you install the PowerVisor-startup file because some of these
   example scripts are used in the startup script.

      o Copy 'PowerVisor-startup' to your S: directory

      o Make a subdirectory 'pv' in S:
        Note that it is best to put all PowerVisor scripts (except the
        PowerVisor-startup script) in 'S:pv' because then you don't need
        to type this pathname when you use the 'script' command (PowerVisor
        automatically looks in that subdirectory)

      o Put all example scripts from the archive (in subdirectory 's/pv')
        in that new subdirectory

      o The included PowerVisor-startup file also needs FD: assigned to
        the subdirectory containing your fd-files. Fd-files are files
        containing information about Amiga library functions. If you don't
        have these files (note that you can find the AmigaDOS 1.3 fd-files
        on the Extras 1.3 disk) you must delete the four lines in the
        PowerVisor-startup file starting with '-lfd', otherwise add
        the following line to your S:user-startup or S:startup-sequence :

            assign fd: <subdir for fd-files>

   Execute the following steps to install the manual (which can also be
   used as an enhanced online help file if you have MultiView
   (© Commodore) :

      o Make a subdirectory called 'docs' in the 'PV' subdirectory (this
        place is only important if you plan to use MultiView. MultiView
        will look for the documentation in 'pv:docs')

      o Copy all manual files from the archive (the complete 'docs' sub-
        directory) to the new 'docs' subdirectory

      o It is possible that the 'CommandRef.guide' file is compressed
        (to make it possible that the manual fits on one old filesystem
        disk). If this is the case it will be named 'CommandRef.guide.qq'.
        Decompress it with the 'dc' utility like this :

            dc CommandRef.guide.qq CommandRef.guide 4
            delete CommandRef.guide.qq

        You won't need the 'dc' utility for anything else. Delete it when
        you are ready with it

      o If you have MultiView you can use it to read the documentation.
        You can also start MultiView from within PowerVisor (with 'ahelp',
        'cmdhelp' and 'funhelp') so you have a magnificent online help
        environment. If this is the case you can delete the following
        files :

            ConvertGuide2Doc
            ConvertGuide2Doc.c
            doc.info
            ConvertDoc.script

      o If you don't have MultiView but you don't mind the MultiView
        commands in the manual you can also delete the previous files
        like in the previous step

      o If you don't have MultiView and you want to convert the manual
        to a more readable (readable with a normal textviewer, that is)
        format you must follow the following procedure :

            cd pv:docs
            for each #?.guide file do

               ConvertGuide2Doc #?.guide #?.doc (don't use wildcards,
                                                replace with correct
                                                filename)
               delete #?.guide
               delete #?.guide.info
               copy doc.info #?.doc.info

        After this you can delete the four files like in the previous
        steps

      o The 'docs' subdirectory also contains a 'searchit' program. This
        program is used by the 'index' alias defined in the
        PowerVisor-startup file. If you have the 'ixemul.library' it is
        probably best to replace 'searchit' by 'searchit.gcc' because
        this version is much faster and shorter.

               copy searchit.gcc searchit

        You can delete 'searchit.lc' and 'searchit.gcc' after that.
        You can also delete 'searchit.c' if you don't want to look
        at the source

   There are some additional utilities that you can use to enhance some
   features of PowerVisor. Execute the following steps to install them :

      o If you want to change the online help (PowerVisor-help) you need
        the 'QuickHelp' utilities. Copy the following files in the same
        subdirectory where the 'pv13' (or 'pv') executable is located :

            MakeHelp13
            ArcFiles13
            Help13

        If you want you can remove the '13' suffix from their names

      o If you want to make your own structure files (see the 'addstruct'
        command) you must copy the 'MStruct13' utility in the same
        subdirectory where the 'pv13' (or 'pv') executable is located


   If you want you can also copy the additional 'Examples', 'Source' and
   'PVDevelop' subdirectories. PowerVisor does not need these. They are
   for your information only.

   This concludes the manual installation for AmigaDOS 1.3.
