| How To Get The Source ?                          Tue Nov  3 17:23:12 1992 |

If you send another $25 US (in addition to the $25 shareware fee) I will
send you the source of the latest PowerVisor. Before you do this however, you
must consider the following things :

- PowerVisor is almost completely in assembler. The only parts in C are the
  ARexx port and the disassembler
- I use Macro68 to assemble PowerVisor and SAS/C to compile the C programs.
  I've made NO attempts what so ever to make the source compatible with
  other assemblers or compilers (see also below)
- I use the new assembler syntax supported by Motorola for the 68020 and
  higher. This means that the following instruction (for example) :
            move.l 7(a0,d0),d2
  is written as :
            move.l (7,a0,d0),d2
  This new syntax is more logical (in my eyes) than the old 68000 syntax.
  The problem with this approach is that you can only assemble PowerVisor
  on assemblers supporting this new syntax (Macro68 is the only assembler
  I know which does that)
- The source for PowerVisor is approximately 1000K large. So I think it's a
  rather big challenge to try to understand it completely (I'm not sure that
  even I understand my own source completely :-)
  It's more than 47000 lines machinelanguage and a bit C
- The source is well documented FOR ME. Initially the source was not ment
  to be read by other people. Therefore the comments may not always be
  very clear
- I'm not very proud of all pieces of code I have made :-)
- I use include files belonging to several other packages (like reqtools)
  which you must get seperately and I use precompiled include files with
  Macro68
- I use tab size 3 for assembler and tab size 2 for C

In summary, I think it will not be easy to reassemble PowerVisor on another
Amiga with other development tools.

If you find bugs in the source I would very much appreciate it if you send
me some info about the bug(s) (where in the source I can find them, possible
corrections or other suggestions)
