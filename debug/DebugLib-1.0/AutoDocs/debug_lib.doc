   NAME
        KCmpStr -- compare two NULL-terminated strings. (V37)

   SYNOPSIS
        mismatch = KCmpStr(string1, string2)
        D0                 A0       A1

        LONG KCmpStr(STRPTR, STRPTR);

   FUNCTION
        string1 is compared to string2 using the ASCII collating sequence.
        If the strirngs have different lengths, the shorter is treated as if
        it were extended with zeros.

   INPUTS
        string1, string2 - strings to be compared.

   RESULT
        result - value representing relationship between string1 and string2:
                     <0 means string1 < string2
                     =0 means string1 = string2
                     >0 means string1 > string2

   NOTES
        @KCmpStr, @KStrCmp, @kstrcmp, KStrCmp are identical assembly
        interfaces that want two pointers in registers. _KCmpStr, _KStrCmp,
        _kstrcmp are C interfaces that expect the parameters on the stack.

debug.lib/KDoFmt                                             debug.lib/KDoFmt

   NAME
        KDoFmt -- format data into a character stream. (V37)

   SYNOPSIS
        nextData = KDoFmt(formatString, dataStream, putChProc, putChData)
        D0                A0            A1          A2         A3

        APTR KDoFmt(STRPTR, STRPTR, void (*)(), APTR);

   FUNCTION
        Interface to ROM RawDoFmt() function.

   INPUTS
        formatString - "C"-language-like NULL terminated format string.
        dataStream   - stream of data to be interpreted.
        putChProc    - the procedure to call with each character to be
                       output.
        putChData    - the value that is passed through to the putChProc
                       procedure.

   RESULT
        nextData - pointer to end of the data stream (the next argument that
                   would have been processed).

   NOTES
        @KDoFmt, KDoFmt are identical assembly interfaces that want pointers
        in registers. _KDoFmt is a C interface that expects the parameters
        on the stack.

debug.lib/KGetChar                                         debug.lib/KGetChar

   NAME
        KGetChar -- get a character from the debugging console. (V37)

   SYNOPSIS
        char = KGetChar()
        D0

        LONG KGetChar(VOID);

   FUNCTION
        Busy waits until a character arrives from the debugging console
        (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud).

   RESULT
        char - a character that arrived from console.

   NOTES
        @KGetChar, @kgetc and KGetChar are identical assembly interfaces.
        _KGetChar, _kgetc are the C interfaces.

debug.lib/KMayGetChar                                   debug.lib/KMayGetChar

   NAME
        KMayGetChar -- get a character from debugging console if present,
                       but don't wait. (V37)

   SYNOPSIS
        flagchar = KMayGetChar()
        D0

        LONG KMayGetChar(VOID);

   FUNCTION
        Checks the status of the debugging console (defaults to the serial
        port at 9600 baud). Returns either -1, saying that there is no
        character present, or whatever character was waiting.

   RESULT
        char - a character that arrived from console, or -1 if there was
               no char waiting.

   NOTES
        @KMayGetChar and KMayGetChar are identical assembly interfaces.
        _KGetChar is the C interface.

debug.lib/KPutChar                                         debug.lib/KPutChar

   NAME
        KPutChar -- put a character to the debugging console. (V37)

   SYNOPSIS
        char = KPutChar(char)
        D0              D0

        LONG KPutChar(LONG);

   FUNCTION
        Puts a character to the debugging console (defaults to the serial
        port at 9600 baud). This function will not return until the
        character has been completely transmitted.

   INPUTS
        char - a char to be outputted.

   RESULT
        char - a character that was outputted.

   NOTES
        @KPutChar, @kputc and KPutChar are identical assembly interfaces that
        expect character in D0 register. _KPutChar, _kputc are the C
        interfaces that expect a character to be a longword on stack.

debug.lib/KPutStr                                           debug.lib/KPutStr

   NAME
        KPutStr -- put a string to the debugging console. (V37)

   SYNOPSIS
        KPutStr(string)
                A0

        VOID KPutStr(STRPTR);

   FUNCTION
        Puts a NULL-terminated string to debugging console (defaults to the
        serial port at 9600 baud). This function will not return until the
        string has been completely transmitted.

   INPUTS
        string - a string to be outputted.

   NOTES
        @KPutStr, @kputs and KPutStr are identical assembly interfaces that
        expect a string pointer to be in A0 register. _KPutStr, _kputs are the
        C interfaces that expect a string pointer to be a longword on stack.

   SEE ALSO
        KPutChar(), KPrintf().

debug.lib/VKPrintf                                         debug.lib/VKPrintf

   NAME
        VKPrintf -- print formatted data to the debugging console. (V37)

   SYNOPSIS
        nextData = VKPrintf(format, data)
        D0                  A0      A1

        APTR VKPrintf(STRPTR, APTR);

        nextData = KPrintf(buffer, format, ...)

        APTR KPrintf(STRPTR, STRPTR, ...);

   FUNCTION
        Prints data formatted with C-like string to the debugging console
        (defaults to the serial port at 9600 baud). The data is formatted
        using ROM RawDoFmt() function.

   INPUTS
        format - "C"-language-like NULL terminated format string.
        data   - stream of data to be interpreted.

   RESULT
        nextData - pointer to end of the data stream (the next argument that
                   would have been processed).

   NOTES
        @VKPrintf, @VKPrintF, KPutFmt, KPrintF are identical assembly
        interfaces that want the two pointers in registers.
        _VKPrintf, _VKPrintF, _vkprintf, _KPutFmt are C interfaces that want
        the two string pointers on stack.
        _KPrintf, _KPrintF, _kprintf are C interfaces that expect the format
        string pointer on the stack, and the parameters on the stack above
        that.
