This is version 1.6 of serlog.

I'm currently quite busy and there is not much time left for serlog.
However, people keep on asking for features and I've implemented quite
a couple of them meanwhile. There are also some general improvements
and new features since V1.3, the last public release.

I gave a lot of pre-releases and partial updates away lately and as I
just don't know when I'll find enough time to finish my plans regarding
serlog I've decided to release it in it's current state.

If version 1.3 fits all your needs you might want to stay with it.
I decided to get 1.6 out mainly because I don't want to wait until
people start calling me Commodore because of the delay ;-)


Well, here are some important things you ought to know about this
release before you use it:

  * No part of this package is able to read the old configuration-file.
    Be sure to delete it (env:serlog.prefs and envarc:serlog.prefs)
    before you install the new device.

  * If you're using OS 2.x the perferences are only written to ENV:
    but not to ENVARC: You'll have to do that yourself if you want
    them to survive a reboot.

  * If the device cannot read the preferences for some reason it will
    always use the defaults WITHOUT telling you about it.

  * Actually, the preferences-stuff should be completely rewritten --
    that's why I have not changed these quirkys.

  * A TIME option has been added. Use with care and don't be curious
    about large numbers in the protocol. It's the result of a
    "emergency" feature-request :)
    No bug, just a do-only-what's-absolutely-required implementation.
    This will change with the next "real" update.

  * Very little testing has been done. I don't expect problems but
    a warning usually doesn't harm.
