ATTENTION !
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a new version of Rem wich replaces v1.1. That had a bug in the
scanning through the lists (forgot one node, sorry). I added acess to task
ready lists.

BEGINNING
~~~~~~~~~
Excuse me for my english but I'm not one (ok je suis français).
It's the first program I put on Aminet.
First of all I don't suggest you read the legal stuff but I tell you it is
at the end of this document (that's the place for a boring thing).
You assume you will read it.

WHAT IS IT ?
~~~~~~~~~~
Rem is a debug utility. For my own I use it to remove the trash window or
task that perturb my work after I got a crash because of my program test.
Yes, if you are a programer I'm sure you understand what I mean and how
usefull it is. Yes, yes, yes I know there is ARTM (by the way
© 1990 - 1994 by D. Jansen & F.J. Mertens) wich does more than my little Rem
but ARTM can't be proud of only 3064 bytes ! (it's 52732 bytes - I don't
tell you how much memory usage is). The other advantage of using Rem is
that it's freeware (ARTM is shareware). No problem with law. Yes Rem is
little and is a cli command too. Why ? Well, when I program I use a cli
window. Nothing more natural to use a debug cli utility. Rem uses only the
amount of memory it's in. No memory for useless gadgets.

HOW DOES IT WORK ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Usage : Rem [address]
Read the '.ouput' files.
For :
- a window : it clears its IDCMP port, removes its pointer, menu and closes
  it.
- a screen : it removes it (you cannot close a screen if there are windows
  opened for V36).
- a library : it closes it (how many times it's necessary) and removes it
  from memory.
- a device : it removes it from memory (if possible).
- a task : it removes it from memory (ready tasks are shown first).

TIPS
~~~~
When you start a program from cli, a task whose name is 'CON' is created (if
you run it you'll get 'Background_Cli' task). If your program crashes you
can remove the first 'CON' (or 'Background_Cli' ) task because I notice that
the current shell task is at the bottom of the list. It seems to be general:
the active window is at the bottom too. You may remove the task
'shell process' associated with your shell window. I could'nt find the name
of the cli process without using some V36 functions and I wanted that my
program ran on all amiga models. Rem is secure : you can give it a wrong
address. If it didn't find the address in its lists it outputs an error
message. Rem handles Ctrl-C and perfectly multitasks.

A LITTLE STORY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now a little story about Rem.
I programed it with E (by the way © Wouter van Oortmerssen). I used 2.1b
version that is freeware. Why E ? Well, like some of us, I tried much
compilers. The problem is that I have a very, very little amiga (an amiga
600 with no extensions). I've used C because it's the usual machine
language compiler I knew. Before I tried to program in assembler. But it's
difficult for a guy who have no books (only general C books). I got E from
a friend and I put it in the wait list because I found no interest to use
another new language. A coupple of years have been spent and I decided to
retry E. And a magic thing happened to me after I read the docs. I found
the PHILOSOPHAL STONE in it ! I discovered that E was the best (simple,
natural) language I knew in all the world ! In fact E is a high level
language 100% compatible with machine code. Yes ! You can program in
Assembler with E ! And with the registered version (3.22), you can use
objects notions like Eiffel, Ada or C++ does (but better). And the magic
thing is that I succeeded to put all the E system in only one disk ! I used
EPU (by the way © Jaroslav Mechacek) to compress files. The only problem is
that E isn't portable on others systems as far as I know. I don't know if
its autor will make a PC version. But who cares ? Try to port a graphical
amiga program to C. That's impossible ! You can only port simple programs,
with C code only and it's very simple to translate an easy program to E or
C.

REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rem run on all amiga models (at least 1.3)

FUTURE ?
~~~~~~~~
If somenone put some interest in Rem I can improve it to do a little things
more (it's free). I can't use gadtools stuff because there is ARTM. I can
add for example the ability to flush the vectors (very used by viruses) :
ColdCapture, CoolCapture, WarmCapture, KickMemPtr,KickTagPtr,KickCheckSum.
I can give access to the list of residents, ressources, last guru number ?,
part of memory, put a little more informations on output, interrupts. The
program won't grow because of it.

LEGAL STUFF
~~~~~~~~~~~
I took this from GNU General Public docs. You can use it for your programs.
