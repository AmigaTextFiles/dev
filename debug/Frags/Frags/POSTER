Somewhere along the way, I picked up a program called frags. It
reports the number of free blocks of size 2^(n-1) to (2^n)-1 for n up
to 19 or so (blocks of max size 512K-1). Since it's easy to have
blocks bigger than 512K, I rewrote it to handle n up to 24 (blocks of
16Meg). Those of you with 68020's can rewrite it to handle n up to 32
if you wish. Since the result is also 300 bytes smaller than the
original, I'm happily replacing the old one everywhere.

I tweaked it a little on the way through, so blocks smaller than any
possible (8 is the smallest possible), including zero-sized blocks,
are handled (just to prevent them from raping things should they occur
because of bugs elsewhere. I also deleted the header so that the
output can be fed to filters. Oughta delete the `:' also, but...

This also represents my first attempt at Knuth's "literate
programming." Need to go read the references to get it right, but the
results speak for themselves (at length).
