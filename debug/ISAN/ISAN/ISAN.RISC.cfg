* The following two lines work but can be achieved automatically (and more
* efficiently) by adding the "TOTAL" command line switch.

*$0000,$FFFF,"  -- TOTAL --  "	;OUCH !! matches all 64K combinations!
*$FFFF,$0000,"---------------"

* WATCH HOW YOU USE THE DON'T CARE MASK FIELD, THE MORE 1s IN IT, THE
* SLOWER "ISAN" WILL BE AT UPDATING ITS WINDOW !!
