Realtime program opcode stream analyzer.
.description
Allows you to monitor any Task's instruction stream in real-time!
Let's you find out (for example) whether a program uses any
020/030/040/88x	instructions, or whether it's most likely
compiled or not.
Output is in the form of a bargraph window and/or a Screen
displaying all 65536 680x0 opcodes mapped to pixels.
An ASCII configuration file defines which individual opcodes
or opcode groups you're interested in snooping on.
