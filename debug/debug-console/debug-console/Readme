Preface

This program was originally made as debugging-help for someone.
I would like others to use it too if they see it useful.

------------------------------------------------

Introduction

When you make a library, I have guessed it is a problem to print debugging
messages like in an ordinary C-program because you don't have access
to dos.library. Without causing a lot of work I have solved this problem
for the lazy ones ;)

My program listens to a public message-port. By using a function
from my example-source, your library will be able to print messages,
for example to the console, easily without accessing dos.library directly.

------------------------------------------------

Features

o Add debug-printing facilities to "programs" with no console-access,
   like libraries. (others?)
o easy to use, does not require an "Einstein" to make it happen.

o compiles under SAS/C 6.56,
  minor changes for other compilers.

------------------------------------------------

Requirements

o exec.library for message passing
o dos.library for message printing.
o a C-compiler

------------------------------------------------

Usage

o insert the function(and its code) from debug-test.c in your own work.
  BOOL printDebug(char * string)

  Add calls to printDebug("a useful message") whereever you need.

o recompile your work.

o start debug-console in a shell. You can redirect the output to a file
  for logging.

  debug-console >filename

o now do whatever you used to do to test the new features of your program.

o Smile. 8)

History

980622 Ooops, strange SCOPTIONS file. Replaced it with a working one.
       Not a serious problem but saves some trouble.

Comments

o I can't make it startable from workbench.
  It's probably something silly but now you know.
