			 Debug v2.10


  If you are a Debug v1.0 user, please read this file.


                    --  Changes from v1.0 --
		    
  
-	Load will now accept parameters to the filename.

- 	Symbolic dissasembly supported.

-	Hexidecimal is no longer the default input radix in all cases.
	To specify say, $a0, "$a0" should be typed.  Otherwise, debug 
	will use the contents of register a0 or attempt to locate a symbol
	called "a0" from the loaded symbol table.

-	'Go' syntax changed.

-	Expression evaluation added with the '=' command.

-	Help is available.

-	Simple expressions may be used as arguments.

-	Zip no longer displays any messages.

-	Breakpoints are displayed in the dissasembly.

-	Trace automatically skips breakpoints  (you don't have to
	clear them).

-	Breakpoint toggle command added.

-	It is no longer an error to reuse the same breakpoint.

-	The 'r' command displays next instruction too.

-	Workbench startup is now supported.

-	The 'n' command is no longer supported. 

-	The 'b' and 'a' commands are no longer supported. Use the
	'=' command instead.

-	The number format conversion  routines have  been changed
	to use the '=' syntax as well - so instead of typing $44, 
	you would type =$44.	

-	The 'm'  command will no longer  insist on dumping memory 
	from an  even address.  If you  specify an  odd  address, 
	dumping will start there.

-	Using the dos.lib  Exit() function  will no longer unload
	Debug.

-	Memory writes are now supported via .b .w and .l commands,
	and f.b, f.w and f.l commands for memory write, and memory
	Fill respectivly.

-	The syntax for displaying the segments is now 'H'.  The H
	stands for 'Hunks'.

-	The default input radix may be altered if desired.

-	Input / output redirection to / from files is supported.
