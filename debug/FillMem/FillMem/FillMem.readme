I have ran into few commands that are said to clean/fill
free memory, but all were throwing hits on my machine
or even worse, so I have made what you see.
As all tools of this sort tend to crash the system I have
included the source code...

Usage: FillMem $11

Fills free memory with $11. Complicated?
Default fill value is 0.
