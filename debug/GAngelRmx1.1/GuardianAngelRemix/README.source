This has been assembled with BAsm, but if you know what you are doing you
should be able to make it work on other assemblers without too much work.

It doesn't install its own MMU tables completely, but it does make a clone of
the current one that is used when it does its magic.

It also doesn't install any bus error handler so Enforcer or CyberGuard is
needed to handle access violations.


If there are any question (doesn't work? can you help on 68030?) do not
hesitate to email.
