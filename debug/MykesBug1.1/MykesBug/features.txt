MykesBug Debugger Version 1.02

Differences between 1.01 and 1.02 denoted by '*'.

Mykesbug Features:

	SAS Level D1 source debugging.  This allows 'C' source debugging
	as well as assembler source debugging (Adapt and Macro68).

	Debugger uses zero OS calls during debugging sessions.  This means
	that when the Operating system has crashed, you can still use the
	debugger to do post mortems or otherwise recover without a reboot.

	Resident portion of debugger catches gurus when you aren't debugging.

	Resident portion of debugger supports infinite (RAM limited) debugging
	contexts.  You can debug as many programs/tasks as you want at the same
	time.

	Smart disassembler - knows about library calls.  Uses the current A6
	value to decide which LVO offset is being referenced.

	Debugger supports suspending each debugging session to allow you to use
	the OS (i.e. edit, etc.) and then resume the debugging session.

	Copper List disassembler

	32 user breakpoints

*	Intelligent display of ExecBase and Exec lists

*	Allows breakpoints in interrupt handlers!!! (not tested, but it should work).
