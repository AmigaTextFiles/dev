 The purpose of RemoveLibrary is to remove a library from memory.  This is
useful for everyone who develops an exec shared library or who accidentally
forgot to close a library (surely not a problem of Cluster programmers,
since libraries are closed automatically by the modules' exit code).  In
the first case you should prepend the RemoveLibrary command to your
library's make script, then you will never be again surprised when the
libraries behaviour doesn't change although you modified a lot things in
your source code.  Remember:  The library remains in memory until a
RemLibrary() call is done or the machine is low on memory, so the
OpenLibrary() function doesn't bother about the newly compiled *.library
file on disk.
 A program with the same function and even the same CLI template exists in
AmiNet (RemLib), but it always tells me, that removing of the library is
impossible.  Another programm called Rem is not able to remove libraries
specified by name, so you can't use it in scripts.

CLI arguments:

LIB
 The name of the library/datatype/gadget class etc. to be removed. The
name includes the extension (*.library/*.datatype/*.gadget), that means
exactly the string you would pass to OpenLibrary().
 
FORCE
 If a library is not used but still in memory this option should be left
out. Otherwise you can use the FORCE option to remove the library. Be sure
that there is no program that still uses the library or which tries to
close it at same time like RemoveLibrary. FORCE ought to be used only if
the program that opened the library is crashed.

 Since RemoveLibrary obtains the library pointer by OpenLibrary (probably
the most system friendly method) the program will always load the library
into the memory if it isn't there.
