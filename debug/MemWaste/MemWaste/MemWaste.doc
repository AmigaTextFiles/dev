***********************

Imagine the following situation: You have a 4 MB memory board, and now you
get an A2630 that needs 32-Bit-RAM to work best. In your Startup-sequence
you mount a RAD: of e. g. 1 MB size. The RAD: now wastes your 32-Bit-RAM,
nice?!? I found myself in this situation and I solved the problem:
MemWaste allocates all fast memory but a size specified from you. The
32-Bit-RAM gets allocated. If you now Mount RAD: the RAD is in the
16-Bit-RAM. Now you can free the allocated memory with another call to
MemWaste.

MemWaste runs on every Kickstart version and MUST be run from CLI/Shell. The
usage is quite simple:

MemWaste 1500000                ; allocate all fast mem but 1.5 MB
Mount RAD:
MemWaste f                      ; free recently allocated memory block


Note: MemWaste saves the size and the memory address to T:MemWaste.xyq. If
you execute "MemWaste f" this file will be deleted. If you run MemWaste
with a byte number as argument twice, YOU CANNOT FREE THE FIRST MEMORY
BLOCK, so you must always run MemWaste pairwise. "MemWaste xxx", do
something "MemWaste f".

Hint: You can check the correct working with SFragMem, another tool from me
(note: SFM needs OS 2.0). You will find it (hopefully) on a Fish Disk.
