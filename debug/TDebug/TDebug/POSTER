	This is version 1.00.  It will give you most of the IO request 
information for any device(s) you choose.  It makes an assumption:

	-(1) The device that it is monitoring doesn't go away while it's
	monitoring it.

	The program understands The trackdisk.device and will breakup the
Offset field into cylinder , track,  and block number (sorry, currently
only prints the numbers right for the Amiga's Floppies).

	TDEBUG works by intercepting the EXEC  SendIO() and DoIO() vectors.
The new vector checks the sent request against the list of devices you want
displayed and places the IOStdReq part of the request in a FIFO (Allocating
a copy of the IOStdReq).  It then signals the main program.

	The Main program is constantly waiting for the latter signal, or 
a BREAK (CTRL-C or CTRL-D).  When it gets the signal, it checks the FIFO
and pulls off any pending buffers, displaying their contents and 
deallocating the memory.

	This is what I used to get those DOS statistics for you.  It makes
an excellent debugging tool for devices since you can intercept any device.
Please mail all suggestions and comments to me.. remember, this is only
V1.00
