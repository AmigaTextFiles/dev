BPPCFix			by Frank Wille

Allows you to remove some ROM resident processor libraries like the 
"ppc.library" or the resident "68040" and "68060.library" of the "Blizzard"
boards to be able to replace them with some customized processor libraries
in this archive. More about installation and configuration is in the
documentation in its drawer. 

Big thanks goes to Frank Wille and Stephen Brookes for working this out!

Sashimi			by Olaf "Olsen" Barthel

This tool redirects "Raw IO" terminal output to a console window, as 
generated by programs that use "debug.lib" functions like kprintf() and
friends. It allows to use these tools even if no external terminal is 
available to capture this output. 

To tell "MuForce" to use the "Sashimi" output window, specify the "RawIO"
option.

More about the command line options of Sashimi is in its documentation,
"Sashimi.doc"

PatchWork		by Richard Körber

Most crashes seen on an Amiga system are not directly related to invalid 
memory accesses, but are due to calling Os functions incorrectly or in an
undocumented way. PatchWork checks the most frequently used Os calls for
these cases and will generate a warning if it finds a problem. More about
PatchWork can be found in its documentation.

If you like PatchWork, you may also look into OsGrind by myself. It provides
similar features, though the Os call checks it performs are configurable 
through its own language.

SegTracker by Mike Sinz, updated with permission by Thomas Richter

This program records segment, symbol and line number/source file 
information from all binaries loaded through the system and provides them
to many debugging tools, including the tools included in this archive. It 
is an indispensible debugging tool helping you trace down where in your
source a particular problem occured. Note that line number and symbol
information is only available if you start it with the "LoadSymbols"
argument, and such information is embedded in first place into the binary.
For details, check its documentation in SegTracker.doc.

Thanks Olaf, thanks Frank, thanks Stephen, thanks Richard, thanks Mike for 
allowing me to include your programs in this package, and thanks for 
writing them in first place!
