This archive contains THOR's low-level Debugger COP.

COP is the debugger file itself and COP.info its icon, Terminal and
Terminal.info an serial transfer program that can be used for remote-
debugging with COP.
Terminal.doc is the documentation of COPs private transfer protocol
(not the documentation of the terminal program itself, I think it is
quite easy to use) and COP.doc the documentation of the debugger.

If you want to install COP, READ COP.DOC FIRST !

--> If you use a 68060 or 68040 based system, check the caveats at the end
of the COP.DOC file carefully.

--> If you use Enforcer, MuForce or a similar program, check the caveats
section of COP.DOC carefully.

To install the terminal program, just copy it to a drawer of your choice.

c) a data carrier with the Program installed is made available to the
   author for free except for shipment costs, and

d) provided further that all information on said data carrier is
   redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge.


Redistribution of a modified version of the Archive, the Program or the
