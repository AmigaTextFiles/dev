Here are the changes I made to the memwatch library:

* Fixed a bug in mwcontrol.c. Do a
  `diff mwcontrol.c.orig mwcontrol.c' to see the small patch.

* Added a couple of typecasts `(long)size' in memwatch.h to
  eliminate some compiler warnings.

* Compiled without trouble using SAS/C 6.58

* Doug Walkers email address is walker@southpeak.com (as of 08-Jan-97)
  You may try walker@unx.sas.com, though.

Enjoy!
