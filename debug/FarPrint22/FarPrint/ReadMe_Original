                          - FarPrint v1.5 -
        Debugging functions for programs which don't have any
                     links to their environment.

        IMPORTANT! FarPrint NEEDS the Arp.Library, read below!

                             BACKGROUND:
                             -----------
Your  compiler usually comes with a set of debugging functions, called
the  debug.lib.   In this collection of routines you will find various
functions  to communicate with a terminal connected to the serial port
of  your  Amiga  at 9600 bps.  A fine idea, but - are you one of those
lucky  guys who own two Amigas or an Amiga and a PC?  If not, FarPrint
may  help  you.  The FarPrint package was created to support debugging
the  fantasy  roleplaying  game  "Legend  of  Faerghail"  and has been
successfully tested with various other projects.

                              FEATURES:
                              ---------
FarPrint  consists  of  two  major parts:  one harbour process open to
receive  and  distribute  messages  and  requests  and  a  set  of 'C'
functions  to  be  linked into any program wishing to communicate with
the FarPrint main process.  While the standard debug.lib functions may
even  be able to get a message through when the Amiga has already gone
home  to  its  masters (Guru!), FarPrint requires the standard program
environment  (exec, dos, intuition & graphics) to be intact to display
messages.    The   interface   routines   use  the  functions  of  the
exec.library only, so they are safe to call even from low-level tasks.

The  FarPrint  main  process  runs as an independent program, since it
detaches  itself  from  the  CLI  process  it  has  been started from.
Gadgets  are provided to scroll through the list of recorded messages.
Menu  selections  can  be  used  to interrupt the activity of FarPrint
(Pause/Continue),  save  the  list of recorded messages and to iconify
the FarPrint window.

FarPrint  can  record  up to 128 messages, when the buffer is full the
oldest messages get discarded to make room for the new messages.

Version  1.5  introduces a shared library as a replacement for the 'C'
language communcation routine fragment.  Note that this library can be
opened  from processes only or fireworks will be seen tonight (you may
alternatively still use the FarCom.c package).  The text print routine
can   be   called  from  interrupt  code  now  since  texts  are  sent
asynchronously.   This  version  also introduces linker code & library
glue routines for both Lattice & Manx.

                            REQUIREMENTS:
                            -------------
To  execute  successfully,  the  FarPrint  main  process  requires the
arp.library.   Any  version  will  do, version 39.1 is best.  FarPrint
uses  the  famous  file requester for message saving.  FarPrint is not
limited to a special amount of memory.

                            INSTALLATION:
                            -------------
Put  arp.library and farprint.library into LIBS:, FarPrint into C:  or
SYS:   and compile the supplied FarCom.c routines.  Lattice users will
have  to assemble the assembly language part separately or may use the
supplied  latticefarcom.lib  instead.  The resulting object files will
have to be linked to your program code.

                               CREDITS:
                               --------
Credits  go  to ARP Programmers for the phantastic ARP 1.3 release, Ed
Hoogerbeets,  Jimm Mackraz & Neil Katin for the library skeleton code,
Leo Schwab for the basic Iconify routine, Justin V.  McCormick for the
printf()-like  formatting  routine  and  to  Jürgen Haage whose R.C.T.
(Requester  Construction  Tool)  was  employed to construct the gadget
environment.  Thanks to all of you.

                   --------------------------------
If you like FarPrint program and wish to contribute any money I urge you
to send at least 5$ to...

I  suppose Amnesty International can make better use of the money than
I can.

I don't care what happens to FarPrint, copy it, sell it, delete it, it
is meant to be PUBLIC-DOMAIN.  But don't 'fleece' other users for it.


           DEVELOPMENT HISTORY (most recent change first):
           -----------------------------------------------
V1.5	Gadget response now generally better, scrolling speeded up
	slightly, new shared library introduced, texts are now sent
	asynchronously to the harbour process (even interrupt code
	is able to call these routines now!), support files for
	both Lattice & Manx added.

V1.4	Added keyboard control (cursor up and down scroll the list),
	got rid of the flashing of the list and took care of the
	main window (if active, action is suspended). Pause/skip
	function redefined (will ignore all incoming actions
	now).

V1.3	First public release, easy and (hopefully) comfortable enough.

V1.2	Skipped.

V1.1	Skipped.

V1.0	Fortunately not published.
