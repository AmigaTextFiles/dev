[I'm not afraid of no line eaters!]

I was so intrigued by Phillip Lindsay's MONPROC program, I got out my
AmigaDOS Technical Reference Manual and looked up the DOS packet section.
I found that there was a lot of interesting information in the packets 
besides the packet type, so I modified MONPROC to print these fields as 
well.  For instance, it prints the data that was read or writen during 
ACTION_READ and ACTION_WRITE packets, and prints the name of the file 
associated with the Lock field for ACTION_PARENT and ACTION_LOCATE_OBJECT.

The following is the source to this modified version.  While I was
working on it, I restructured the program a bit (but the algorithms are the
same).  It is changed to such a degree, however, that I can't just post the
differences, so I'm posting the whole source.  I have retained Phillip's 
copywrite notice, as he requested.

See the documentation for usage information, especially the cautions about
monitoring file system processes (remember to use the NOLOCK option when
you do), and for compiling and linking instructions.

I found this a very useful and fun tool, and hope others do as well.
