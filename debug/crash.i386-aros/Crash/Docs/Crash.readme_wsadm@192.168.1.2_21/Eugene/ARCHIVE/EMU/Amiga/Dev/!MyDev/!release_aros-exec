Crash - 1.1 (1.01) + source with makefile
==================

Warning: This program will crash with purpose!

A small and simple command that "safely" crashes, by writing to address 0
that is protected and guaranteed never written to.

Why would you want a program that crashes?

I for example, sometimes need a "safe" way to crash a program so I can check
where the error output is going, etc etc.

C source code included with a makefile.
