@Node StartingPowerVisor "Getting Started : How to start PowerVisor"
To start PowerVisor, you can simply type (Before you continue, note that
I assume that the s:PowerVisor-config file does not exist and that the
s:PowerVisor-startup file is minimal (like on the original disk). If this
is not the case some output may not be the same as in this tutorial. If
you want to be absolutely sure, delete s:PowerVisor-config and
s:PowerVisor-startup (or rename them)) :

< pv <enter>

or

< run pv <enter>

Normally PowerVisor will now open a screen. If this does not work it
is possible that you do not have enough memory. Quit some programs and
try again. PowerVisor is not very memory consuming. Also note that
you need the powervisor.library installed in your libs: directory.

If everything is fine you will see the PowerVisor screen. This screen
is very sober. The bottom line of the screen is the stringgadget where
you must type all PowerVisor commands. This stringgadget is automatically
activated whenever the PowerVisor window becomes active.
  (1.3 : due to a bug in AmigaDOS 1.2/1.3 you can get problems when you
  use a sunmouse like program. If the PowerVisor stringgadget is active,
  no other window can be activated. If this happens you must activate
  the window by clicking on it.)
The stringgadget buffer is 400 bytes long by default. This is also the
largest command that you can execute (you can change this value with
the @{" prefs " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Prefs"} command).
The rest of the screen is dedicated for PowerVisor output. After startup
this screen is normally empty (except for the copyright message).

Because the PowerVisor commandline is a stringgadget you can use all
editing facilities provided for stringgadgets.

You will also see a blue bar (this color may be different if you use other
color preferences or if you use AmigaDOS 1.3) just below the screen bar
containing the word 'Main' at the left and a strange box at the right.
These things will be explained in the @{" Screens and Windows " Link "pv:docs/Screen.guide/Main"}
tutorial chapter.

@Node StartingPVonBadBoards "Getting Started : Starting PowerVisor on faulty 68020 boards"
There are some 68020/30 boards that give incorrect information when asked
if a MMU is present. Therefore PowerVisor is not able to check if the
MMU is present and will even hang on those systems. To solve this problem
I have added a commandline option '-m'. With this commandline option you
can force a certain MMU or no MMU. When you use this option PowerVisor will
not use the internal MMU test routine.
For example:
   use -m0 if you have a 68020 but NO MMU
   use -m68851 if you have a 68020 WITH a MMU (68851)
   use -m68030 or -m68040 if you have these processors
You should not use this commandline option unless you have a faulty
board (like some CSA 68020 boards and maybe others)
@EndNode

@Node CurListAndBasics "Getting Started : Current list and some basic commands"
Left from the stringgadget is the current list indicator. Default is
'task'. The current list is the list that is used for string parsing
(see later) and the @{" list " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/List"} command. Try this :

< list <enter>

And you get something like this :

> Task node name      : Node     Pri StackPtr  StackS Stat Command         Acc

You can also get this list by typing :

< list task <enter>

But since 'task' is the current list (at this moment) this is not
necessary.

In this list you see all the tasks currently in the system. 'Node' is the
address in memory, 'Pri' is the task priority (in hexadecimal), 'StackPtr'
is the contents of A7 or SP, 'StackS' is the size of the stack, 'Stat'
is the state of the task ('Rdy' for ready, 'Wait' for waiting and 'Run'
for running) and 'Command' is the executing command (this is only for cli
processes). After the command name you can see 'TASK' for tasks, 'PROC' for
a process and '(xx)' for a cli. 'Acc' is for accounting information, it
is disabled at this moment.

All hexadecimal numbers are padded with zeroes.

You can also go to another current list by typing the list name :

< p <enter>

(Note how the current list indicator has changed)

< l <enter>

Note that we used abbreviations for the commands. 'l' is the same as
'list' and 'p' is equivalent to 'port'. Most commands can be
abbreviated. You can type 'help commands' to see all commands with their
shortcuts (the capital letters represent the required bit of the command,
all other characters are optional, this convention is used everywhere in
this documentation where appropriate).

You get something like this :

> MsgPort node name   : Node     Pri SigBit SigTask
> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
> REXX                : 07E2B13C 00      31 07E39BA8

> SetPatch Port       : 07E23060 9C       0 00000000

Now we go back to the task list :

< t <enter>

or

< task <enter>

and ask a list :

< list <enter>

Now we are going to ask some information about a task with the @{" info " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Info"}
command :

< info powervisor <enter>

and we get something like this :

> Task node name      : Node     Pri StackPtr  StackS Stat Command         Acc
> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
> PowerVisor1.0.task  : 07E8CE60 00  07E8E656    1024 Wait            TASK -
>
> IDNestCnt    : 00       | TDNestCnt    : FF       | SigAlloc     : E000FFFF

> MemEntry     : 07E8CEAA | UserData     : 00000000 |

This is the listing of the task structure. If you ask info about a
process you get more information. If you ask info about a cli process
you get even more information.
  (1.3 : The amount of information is a bit less in 1.3 because there
  are some new fields in AmigaDOS 2.0).

Because the task list was the current list we can use the names present
in this list instead of the pointer to the task. This name is not case
sensitive and need not be the complete name. All the following commands
would be equivalent (see the @{" Expressions " Link "pv:docs/Expressions.guide/Main"} chapter for more info) :

< info powerv <enter>

< info 07E8CE60 <enter>

< info 07e8ce60 <enter>

< info 'PoWerVisor1.0.tASK' <enter>

< info task:powerv task <enter>

Look at the last command. We would have needed this notation if our current
list wasn't the task list. The '<list>:' notation can be used everywhere.
(Do not forget the extra 'task' argument, otherwise PowerVisor can crash)

You see that it can be handy to set the current list right.

Some commands (like @{" kill " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Kill"}, @{" freeze " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Freeze"}, ...) do not need the current list.
They automatically assume the list which is right in most cases for
that particular command (this feature is called 'autodefault'). For
example (Don't type this, because it can crash your Amiga !) :

    Go to another list :

    < port <enter>

    Try to kill the PowerVisor task :

    < kill powervisor <enter>

    Although the current list is 'port', you need not preceed 'powervisor'
    with 'task:'. The 'kill' command automatically assumes the 'task' list.
    If you still want to 'kill' a port you can always type :

    < kill port:someport <enter>

The @{" info " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Info"} command (see above) does not set it's own current list because
it can be used on all lists.
@EndNode

@Node Snapping "Getting Started : Snapping away"
It is not always possible to use names. If you have two tasks with the
same name it would be ambiguous. In that case you must use the address of
the task. Try the following :

List the screens with @{" list " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/List"} :

< list scrs <enter>

and you will get something like this :

> Screen name         : Address  Left  Top Width Height FirstWindow
> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
> PowerVisor   (V1.00 : 07E8EB20    0    0   692    452 07E8F818

> Workbench Screen    : 07E3AF88    0 -572   692   1024 07E507C8

Type (Don't press enter)

< info <space>

and position the mouse on the address 07E8EB20 :

< <click left mouse button> scrs

On the commandline there should now be something like 'info 07E8EB20 scrs'.

< <enter>

and we get :

This feature of PowerVisor is called 'snapping'. The left mouse button
copies the word under the mousepointer to the stringgadget.
If you snap a word PowerVisor will automatically add a space to the
commandline below. If you do not like this you can disable this feature
with the @{" mode " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Mode"} command.

Also note the special form of the @{" info " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Info"} command. The second argument to
'info' is optional and is a name of a list. You MUST use the second
argument if you want info about something that is not in the current list.
Otherwise 'info' will try to interprete a screen as a task or something
else. This could crash the Amiga !
@EndNode

@Node PowerVisorHotKey "Getting Started : The PowerVisor hot key"
Go to the Workbench screen :

< <left amiga> n

If you want PowerVisor back you can use the hotkey (if you have QWERTY):

< <right alt>+<right shift>+/

For any other keyboard you must press the key left from the <right shift>
key.

The PowerVisor screen snaps back to life.

You can also use this key combination if PowerVisor is in hold-mode.

< hold <enter>

The PowerVisor screen disappears.

< <right alt>+<right shift>+/

The PowerVisor screen is opened again.

This keycombination can be redefined with the @{" prefs " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Prefs"} command.
Also see the @{" Standard PowerVisor keys " Link "PowerVisorKeys"} section.
@EndNode

@Node Errors "Getting Started : Errors"
Everybody makes mistakes. Therefore PowerVisor needs some sort of
error handling. Make sure that you have the following files installed in
the S: directory or if you have AmigaDOS 2.0 you can put the files in the
directory where the PowerVisor executable can be found :
   PowerVisor-errors, PowerVisor-help and PowerVisor-ctrl.

Try this :

< task <enter>
< list <enter>

Now you have done something wrong ! But what ? Well we should ask
PowerVisor :

< why <enter>

> Syntax Error !
>    You typed a command that powervisor did not understand, or some
>    of your arguments are badly formed.

The @{" why " Link "pv:docs/Aliases.guide/Why"} command (in fact it is an alias defined in s:PowerVisor-startup)
can be very handy sometimes. You now notice that you forgot a <space>
between 'info' and '07E8FD10'.
@EndNode

@Node Templates "Getting Started : Templates"
If you forgot the syntax for some command you can ask the command template.

< memory? <enter>
or
< memory ? <enter>

> Memory [<start> [<bytes>]]

You can read the following information from this output :
   - You can use 'm' as an abbreviation for 'memory' (the uppercase
     part of the command 'Memory')
   - <start> is an optional argument
   - <bytes> is also optional but you must supply a <start> value if
     you want to supply a <bytes> value.

The templates for these commands are located in the 'PowerVisor-help' file.
You can also show the template using the @{" help " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Help"} command :

< help memory_tmp <enter>
> Memory [<start> [<bytes>]]

This is the only way to ask a template for an ARexx command that has no
equivalent on the PowerVisor commandline :

< help assign_tmp <enter>
> ASSIGN <assignment string>

(Note that 'ASSIGN' is completely in uppercase. This is normal because
in ARexx you can't use abbreviations for commands)

@Node InterruptingPV "Getting Started : Interrupting PowerVisor"

If the page is full PowerVisor will wait for you. The current list
indicator changes to '-MORE-'. Press <space> everytime you want to
proceed to the next page. If you want to stop this listing you can
press <esc>.

You can use the <esc> key to interrupt PowerVisor whenever you want. Or you
can use the <right-alt>+<help> key to pause the PowerVisor output (the
current list indicator will change to '-HALT-')

Note that if you do not want PowerVisor to stop at each page you can use

@Node HistoryBuf "Getting Started : The history buffer"
PowerVisor has a history buffer so you can easily retrieve previous
commands.
This can be handy if you want to repeat a command a few times, or if you
want to correct an error in a commandline.

Starting with PowerVisor V1.10 this history buffer works exactly like the
history buffer in the AmigaDOS 2.0 shell. There is one exception :
PowerVisor does not support the standard <shift>+<up> key to search in the
history. However, you can use this feature if you use the standard
s:PowerVisor-startup file (the one provided with this release of
PowerVisor). This startup script installs this feature for you (it uses the
s:pv/SearchHist ML-script for that purpose).


For example type :

< help <enter>
> PowerVisor help (1.10 Beta)   Sun Sep 22 13:10:59 1991
> ---------------------------
> You can type one of the following for more information on a specific

< <arrow up>

On the commandline appears 'help', this is the previous command.

Use the stringgadget key to go to the end of the line :

< <shift>+<arrow right>

< <space> general <enter>

Now you have executed the command 'help general'.

> Help general

You can use the <arrow up> and <arrow down> keys to scroll in the
history buffer. Normally only 20 lines are remembered in the history
buffer.
Try this :

< prefs history <enter>
> 00000014 , 20

< prefs history 100 <enter>

< prefs history <enter>
> 00000064 , 100

You see that you can change the maximum number of lines in the history with
the @{" prefs " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Prefs"} command. Note that setting another number clears the history
buffer.
@EndNode

@Node MakingConfigFile "Getting Started : Making a Config file for PowerVisor"
PowerVisor uses the s:PowerVisor-config file (if present) to set default
preferences. This file contains, for example, the value of the 'mode'
variable. If you have installed PowerVisor as you wish (with the @{" mode " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Mode"}
command) you can use @{" saveconfig " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Saveconfig"} to save the config file.

The s:PowerVisor-config file contains the following information :

   - All things you can set with the @{" mode " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Mode"} command
   - All things you can set with the @{" prefs " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Prefs"} command
     Some examples :
         - The maximum length for a commandline
         - Some default values for logical windows
         - Some keydefinitions
         - historybuffer length
         - ...

I recommend that you work with the default values until you now more about
PowerVisor. Especially the logical window preferences are difficult to set
right if you are a first time user. If you think you can cope you can
read @{" Installing PowerVisor " Link "pv:docs/InstallingPV.guide/Main"}.

Note that 'saveconfig' also saves the state and position of all standard
logical windows. See the 'mode intui' feature and the @{" screen " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Screen"} command
for more info.

Warning! If an update for PowerVisor arrives it is possible that the
format for the PowerVisor-config file is not valid anymore. Because of
this it is probably better to delete the PowerVisor-config file when
you have a new version and do the configuration again.
@EndNode

@Node PowerVisorKeys "Getting Started : Standard PowerVisor keys"
Interrupt PowerVisor at any time by pressing <esc>.

Press <right alt>+<right shift>+/ to bring the PowerVisor screen to the
front (or reopen it if PowerVisor was in hold mode).

Using <left-alt> in combination with the numeric keypad you can scroll in
the active logical window. With the <tab> key you can select the active
logical window.

Using the <ctrl> key in combination with the numeric keypad you can scroll
in the debug logical window.

To pause the output of PowerVisor use the <right-alt>+<help> key
combination.


Note that almost all these keys can be reconfigured with the @{" prefs " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Prefs"}
command.

@Node Summary "Getting Started : A summary"
In this section I mention the most useful commands of PowerVisor.
These are the commands that you are probably going to use
most. To get more information about these commands refer to
@{" Command Reference " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Main"} or look in the corresponding tutorial section.
Note that all commands described here begin with some letters in uppercase
and the rest in lowercase. All uppercase is the required part of the
command. You may abbreviate the command until only the uppercase part
is left. Note that this uppercase/lowercase convention is also used in the
online help and in the 'Command Reference'.
