@Node Introduction "Alias Reference : Introduction"
This reference file contains all aliases defined in s/PowerVisor-startup
and s/pv/ExtraAliases.
@EndNode

@Node Ahelp "Alias Reference : ahelp"
   AHELP

Definition : rx 'address command "amigaguide pv:docs/PowerVisor.guide
             screen=PowerVisorScreen"'
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

Call AmigaGuide with the main PowerVisor menu. This alias only works if
you have AmigaGuide.
@EndNode

@Node Asm "Alias Reference : asm"
   ASM <address>

Definition : {rc=[];rx s:pv/assem}
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias calls a simple assembler written in ARexx. See s:pv/assem.pv for
more info about the assembler. Stop the assembler with an empty input line.
@EndNode

@Node At "Alias Reference : at"
   AT <command string> <code string> <qualifier string>


Definition : attach [1] co([2]) qu([3]) e
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias attaches a command to a key (makes a macro). The advantage of
this alias is that you can use names for the code and qualifier of the
key instead of numbers.

Note that you have to define the 'co' and 'qu' functions in order to
use this alias (this is already done in s/PowerVisor-startup).

Note that the 'co' function does not work perfectly in AmigaDOS 1.3. Only
use the 'co' function (and thus the 'at' alias) for special keys
('enter', 'esc', 'up', ...) and not for normal keys ('a', '3', ...).

The following code strings are supported :

   f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, esc, enter, ret, up, down,
   right, left, del, help, tab, numl, scrl, prtsc, home, end, nup, nleft,
   nright, ndown, pgup, pgdn, ins, ndel

   All other strings are interpreted as one char only (you may only use one
   of the above strings if you have AmigaDOS 1.3)

The following qualifier strings are supported :

   lshift, rshift, ctrl, lalt, ralt, lcmd, rcmd


Example :

< at 'help commands' help ralt <enter>

This command attaches the 'help commands' command to the <right-alt>+<help>
key.

@EndNode

@Node Bin "Alias Reference : bin"
   BIN <number>


Definition : bin  = {bin8 ([])>>8;bin8 ([]);print \0a}
             bin8 = print \(([])>>7&1)\(([])>>6&1)\(([])>>5&1)\(([])>>4&1)
                    \(([])>>3&1)\(([])>>2&1)\(([])>>1&1)\(([])&1)
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias shows the binary representation of the 16 least significant
bits of <number>.


Example :

< bin 1234 <enter>
> 0000010011010010
@EndNode

@Node Cm "Alias Reference : cm"
   CM [<number of bytes>]


Definition : m lastmem() []
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias is equivalent to the @{" memory " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Memory"} command. The only difference is
that you can specify the number of bytes to view without having to specify
the starting address.


Related commands: @{" memory " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Memory"}
@EndNode

@Node Cmd "Alias Reference : cmd"
   CMD <cli command line>


Definition : {rc="[]";rx s:pv/cmd}
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

You can use this alias to execute Cli commands from within PowerVisor.
The output will appear on the default logical window. This alias uses
a unique temporary file in 'T:'.
Warning! You can't use Cli commands that ask for input.


Example :

< cmd dir dh0: all <enter>
> ...
@EndNode

@Node Cmdhelp "Alias Reference : cmdhelp"
   CMDHELP <command>


Definition : rx 'address command "amigaguide pv:docs/CommandRef.guide
             screen=PowerVisorScreen doc=[]"'
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

Call AmigaGuide with the Command Reference chapter. This alias only works if
you have AmigaGuide. <command> is the name of the command that you want help
about (use 'Main' for the main Command Reference menu).
@EndNode

@Node Cu "Alias Reference : cu"
   CU [<number of lines>]


Definition : u lastmem() []
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias is equivalent to the @{" unasm " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Unasm"} command. The only difference is
that you can specify the number of lines to disassemble without having to
specify the starting address.


Related commands: @{" unasm " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Unasm"}
@EndNode

@Node Fact "Alias Reference : fact"
   FACT <number>


Definition : fact  = disp {_fact []}
             _fact = void if(([])==1,1,{_fact ([])-1}*([]))
Defined in : s/pv/ExtraAliases

This alias computes the facultaty of its argument. It is an example of
how to use recursive aliases.


Example :

< fact 5 <enter>
> 00000078 , 120


Related commands: @{" disp " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Disp"} @{" void " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Void"}

Related functions: @{" if() " Link "pv:docs/Functions.guide/If"}
@EndNode

@Node Fdebug "Alias Reference : fdebug"
   FDEBUG


Definition : script db
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias installs the fullscreen debugger for you. If the debug logical
window is not open it is opened (@{" dwin " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Dwin"} command). The number of
instructions in the disassembly is set to 5 ('prefs debug' command). Some
keys are assigned to commands (<lcmd> is left amiga key) :

   <ctrl>+z       singlestep one instruction
   <ctrl>+y       singlestep one instruction
   <ctrl>+a       set breakpoint after this instruction and execute
   <ctrl>+s       skip current instruction
   <ctrl>+r       run program until a breakpoint hit occurs
   <ctrl>+x       halt running program
   <ctrl>+b       set/reset a temporary breakpoint at the top of the
                  debug logical window
   <ctrl>+t       singlestep but skip BSR and JSR instructions
   <lcmd>+u       trace until ...
   <lcmd>+b       trace until a change of programflow occurs (branch, ...)
   <rcmd>+a       set debug window start address ...
   <rcmd>+b       set permanent breakpoint ...

Note that these keys can differ when you use another default keymap (like
'azerty' or 'qwertz'). Change the 'db' script if you want to use other
keys.

'fdebug' redefines itself. After the fullscreen debugger is installed you
can use 'fdebug' to remove the fullscreen debugger. 'fdebug' is a toggle.

Note that the 'db' script (located in s/pv) works best when called
from within the alias. Never execute this script directly.

@Node Funhelp "Alias Reference : funhelp"
   FUNHELP <function>


Definition : rx 'address command "amigaguide pv:docs/Functions.guide
             screen=PowerVisorScreen doc=[]"'
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

Call AmigaGuide with the Function Reference chapter. This alias only works if
you have AmigaGuide. <function> is the name of the command that you want help
about (use 'Main' for the main Function Reference menu).
@EndNode

@Node Index "Alias Reference : index"
   INDEX


Definition : rx s:pv/searchkeyword
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias uses the 'searchkeyword.pv' ARexx script to search for a certain
keyword in the complete PowerVisor hypertext manual. After executing this
alias PowerVisor will ask for the string to search. After waiting a bit you
will get a numbered list with all topics where the string was found. Choose
the right number to go to that topic. Simply press enter to quit. This script
will start AmigaGuide to go to that topic. So you need AmigaGuide to use
this alias (unless you change the ARexx script).

This script uses the 'searchit' utility in the 'pv:docs' subdirectory.
This utility searches a topic. There are two versions: 'searchit.gcc'
(compiled with the Gnu C compiler) and 'searchit.lc' (compiled with
the SAS/C 5.10 compiler). The gcc version is a lot faster, but it needs
the 'ixemul.library' (available from FTP). Copy the version you want
over 'searchit' (default is 'lc' version because this will always run).
@EndNode

@Node Lfd "Alias Reference : lfd"
   LFD <library name>


Definition : loadfd [] fd:[]_lib.fd
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias loads a fd-file for a library. It is simply a shorthand
notation.


Example :

< lfd exec <enter>

instead of

< loadfd exec fd:exec_lib.fd <enter>


Related commands: @{" loadfd " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Loadfd"}
@EndNode

@Node Mstack "Alias Reference : mstack"
   MSTACK <task> <microseconds>


Definition : {rwin 1;r 5 {home;d getstack()};stack []}
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias is equivalent to the @{" stack " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Stack"} command. The difference is that
this alias first opens the refresh logical window with one visible line and
installs a refresh command to display the maximum stack usage two times
per second (5 IntuiTicks).


Example :

< mstack workbench 10000 <enter>


Related commands: @{" stack " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Stack"} @{" refresh " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Refresh"}

Related functions: @{" getstack() " Link "pv:docs/Functions.guide/Getstack"}
@EndNode

@Node Opwin "Alias Reference : opwin"
   OPWIN <window name>


Definition : {-openpw [] 0 0 300 200;-openlw [] [] 80 40}
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias opens a physical window <window name> with size 300x200
and opens a logical window with the same name in this physical window.


Related commands: @{" openpw " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Openpw"} @{" openlw " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Openlw"}
@EndNode

@Node Salias "Alias Reference : salias"
   SALIAS <commandline>


Definition : {print \({_fl={pv 48 ·Å[]Å}},%s)\0a;v free(_fl);remvar _fl}
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

With this alias you can show the commandline how it would look like
after alias substitution. This is very useful for debugging aliases.
If an alias does not work well you can use this alias to see what
actually gets executed.


Example :

< alias x '[3][2][1] testing []' <enter>
< salias x i r p last <enter>
> pri testing i r p last


Related commands: @{" print " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Print"} @{" pvcall " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/Pvcall"}

@Node Vu "Alias Reference : vu"
   VU [<number of bytes>]


Definition : view lastmem() []
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias is equivalent to the @{" view " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/View"} command. The only difference is that
you can specify the number of bytes to view without having to specify
the starting address.


Related commands: @{" view " Link "pv:docs/CommandRef.guide/View"}

@Node Why "Alias Reference : why"
   WHY


Definition : help e\(error)
Defined in : s/PowerVisor-startup

This alias gives some additional help for the last error.
