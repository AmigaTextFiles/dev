BPPCFix			by Frank Wille

Allows you to remove some ROM resident processor libraries like the 
"ppc.library" or the resident "68040" and "68060.library" of the "Blizzard"
boards to be able to replace them with some customized processor libraries
in this archive. More about installation and configuration is in the
documentation in its drawer. 

Big thanks goes to Frank Wille and Stephen Brookes for working this out!

Sashimi			by Olaf "Olsen" Barthel

This tool redirects "Raw IO" terminal output to a console window, as 
generated by programs that use "debug.lib" functions like kprintf() and
friends. It allows to use these tools even if no external terminal is 
available to capture this output. 

To tell "MuForce" to use the "Sashimi" output window, specify the "RawIO"
option.

More about the command line options of Sashimi is in its documentation,
"Sashimi.doc"

PatchWork		by Richard Körber

Most crashes seen on an Amiga system are not directly related to invalid 
memory accesses, but are due to calling Os functions incorrectly or in an
undocumented way. PatchWork checks the most frequently used Os calls for
these cases and will generate a warning if it finds a problem. More about
PatchWork can be found in its documentation.
