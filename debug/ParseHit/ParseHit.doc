INTRODUCTION

This utility is used to transform an output produced by Enforce to a list of
SCMsg message. To work, it need 'FindLine' made by David N. Junod (included in
this archive), SCMsg from the SAS C package, 'rx' from the Rexx package and
the little arexx script 'PutMsg.rexx'.

USAGE

ParseHit takes only one argument, and it is the file you want to transform:

	ParseHit <EnforcerHit file>

If not supplied, ParseHit will try to open an 'EnforcerHit' file.

For an example of what you can do with this little proggy, you can check the
smakefile in this archive.
