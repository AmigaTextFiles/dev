INTRODUCTION

This little utility was inspired by HitMe, written by Doug Walker of
SAS Institute.  It is used to find the source file (and line number)
of an Enforcer hit.

One major difference between this utility and HitMe, is that FindLine
looks into the executable for symbol and debugging information to
obtain the source file and line number.  This version does not
require a map file, object files or source files---it only requires
an executable that contains symbols or LINE (and SRC6) debugging
information.


USAGE

FindLine takes the following arguments:

  MODNAME/A,OFFSET/A,HUNK

Following is a description of the arguments.

  MODNAME/A
  Name of the application.  First looks in <modname>.ld.

  OFFSET
  The hexidecimal offset of the Enforcer hit.

  HUNK
  The hexidecimal hunk number of the Enforcer hit.  Defaults to zero.


REQUIREMENTS

Your C files must be compiled with SAS/C 5.x or beyond, with LINE
debugging turned on.  Best results are obtained with SAS/C 6.x and
beyond.

Assembly files must be compiled with CAPE (or HX68) with DEBUG turned
on.

This utility should work with any compiler or assembler that produces
standard LINE debugging hunks.

When using Enforcer (and MungWall) you should be using SegTracker for
best results.


CHANGES

37.2 (11-Mar-93)

No longer requires a map file.  Uses asyncio to access the executable
(greatly speeds access).
