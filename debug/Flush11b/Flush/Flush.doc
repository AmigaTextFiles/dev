NAME

	Flush
	Selectively remove unused libraries, devices and fonts from memory.

FUNCTION

	Flush is just an enhanced version of C='s 'flushlibs' program.

INSTALLATION

	Simply copy Flush to C: - that's all.

TEMPLATE

	Flush NAMES/M,LIBS=LIBRARIES/S,DEVS=DEVICES/S,FONTS/S,ALL/S,QUIET/S

		NAMES/M:     The list of libraries, devices and fonts to flush.
		             Standard Amiga wildcards are supported.
		             See examples.

		LIBRARIES/S: Restrict the flush to unused libraries only.
		             May be abbreviated to LIBS.

		DEVICES/S:   Restrict the flush to unused devices only.
		             Me be abbreviated to DEVS.

		FONTS/S:     Restrict the flush to fonts only.

		ALL/S:       Flush libraries, devices and fonts. This is the
		             default if none of the LIBRARIES, DEVICES or
		             FONTS options is given.

		QUIET/S:     Silent operation.

EXAMPLES

	- Flush all unused libraries, devices and fonts:

		Flush

		or

		Flush ALL

	- Flush unused fonts only:

		Flush FONTS

		or

		Flush #?.font

		(unless a library or device happens to be named
		'something.font'!)

	- Flush unused devices and fonts only:

		Flush DEVS FONTS

		or

		Flush #?.device #?.font

		or

		Flush ~(#?.library)

	- Flush a particular device:

		Flush my.device

		or

		Flush my#? DEVS

	- Flush all libraries but the SAS/C compiler, all devices but
	  serial.device, and all fonts but helvetica.font:

		Flush ~(sc#?.library) ~(serial.device) ~(helv#?.font)

	- etc.

HISTORY

	- Version 1.0 (30.10.95)
		* Initial release

	- Version 1.1 (11.11.95)
		* Simply reduced the possibility for unused elements
		  to stay in memory. Flush should now be able to
		  really flush everything that's flushable.

	- Version 1.1b (12.11.95)
		* Corrected a really stupid bug that made Flush
		  incorrectly report the number of flushed items.
