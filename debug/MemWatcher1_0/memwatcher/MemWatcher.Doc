MemWatcher 1.0

(c)1995 Frank Brandau


Short
-----

As a debugging utility, MemWatcher displays memory usage.


Usage
-----

Start  it  and  watch memory consumation of other programs.  After exiting,
every  program  should free all of its allocated memory.  Wasting memory is
not  acceptable  in  the  multitasking  environment the Amiga provides.  So
check your own programs to free all memory after leaving.

MemWatcher   displays  memory  differences  after  timed  intervalls  (Dos:
Delay(Timebase)).   To  adjust  the  display, you can hit the lower part of
MemWatcher,  the memory difference is then set to zero.  The amount of free
memory  is  internally  read with AvailMem.  If there is no difference, the
colour  will  change  and  will  also  if  the difference gets greater than
approximately  2.2  Megs.   MemWatcher  shows  memory consumption, positive
values are used memory.

After  starting  MemWatch, run the program you wish to check.  Close it and
set  MemWatch  to  zero.   Run your program again and quit.  See any memory
left  allocated?   Then  go  into development again.  You have to start and
exit  a program before, because it normally uses libraries or fonts or devs
or  i  don't  know  what  which  could remain open and thus consume memory.
Running  the  program again means that every resource is already in memory,
so all consumptions are due to your own program.

Another  way  of  using  MemWatcher  is  to  watch  memory  consumption  of
subroutines, thus analysing memory performance of often used funktions.

The display is logarithmic, to better show small amounts of memory usage.


ToolTypes
---------

Following ToolTypes are supported by MemWatcher:

  PubScreen=...   : Name of the Public Screen MemWatcher is opening on
                    (If screen is not valid, MemWatcher will quit quietly)
  XPos=...        : Initially horizontal position of window
  YPos=...        : Initially vertical position of window
  Timebase=...    : Output speed, value used for delay
  Display=...     : Display width of window


The program
-----------

MemWatcher  is  small,  about  10k  and  uses no more than 21k running with
standart  settings.   It  is  programmed  entirely  in  Cluster,  the  most
underestimated  language.   It  has no further features other than watching
memory,  because  i  like  my tools efficient.  Source is included, to have
some Cluster source in the public domain.

MemWatcher works under 2.x and 3.x.  I don't know if it works under earlier
versions of the operating system, give it a try.


Inspiration
-----------

MemWatcher was written to replace drip, a program great in its own way, but
with  some  disadvantages,  like  not  having a real workbench interface or
online display.


Bugs
----

MemWatcher  is tested with Enforcer, Mungwall and MemWatcher.  There are no
known errors.

If  window  width  is  to  small to hold your font (height is automatically
adjusted) then use a greater width (simple eh?).


Disclaimer and authors info
---------------------------

This  version  of  MemWatcher is freely distributable as long as all of its
files  are included in their original form without additions, deletions, or

This  software  is  provided  *AS  IS* without warranty of any kind, either
expressed  or implied.  By using MemWatcher, you agree to accept the entire
risk  as  to  the quality and performance of the program.  If you drop your
Amiga onto your cat while running MemWatcher, i will not come to remove the
squeezed bits (And i am not responsible for you not having a cat either).

I like to see MemWatcher as CardWare, if you use it regulary and you happen
to  like  it, then send me some Magic:  The Gathering (TM) cards, available
in  Comic shops all around the world (Surely i like to have some rare).  If
you  have never heard of this game, shame on you.  Try it out to experience
some fun.

Another explosion, eh?  Well, you know what they say, once is happenstance,
twice is coincidence...  Three times is enemy action, yes?
