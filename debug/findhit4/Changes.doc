03/30/93 37.1

	First release.


05/16/93 37.2

	Fixed a problem if the hit was in the first object file in the
	mapfile, FindHit would not find the line.

	Change the mapfile parsing so it finds the filename and base
	offset even if the mapfile was generated with FWIDTH, HWIDTH,
	PWIDTH, or SWIDTH options.

06/30/93 37.3

	Fixed an unfreed lock.

	Fixes it so when everything is in subdirectories FindHit finds
    everything.  Reported by Thomas Kobler, samson@troja.deg.sub.org.

	Fixed it so when object files are not in the same directory as the
    C files FindHit still finds everything.

07/01/93 37.4

	Fixed an unfreed lock that creeped in in 37.3.
