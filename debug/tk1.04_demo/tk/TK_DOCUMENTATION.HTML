<P><FONT SIZE=-1>If you do not know what a debugger, freezer is or if you
have never programmed in assembler - forget it - i do not think that TK
is something for you -(except if you just want to train some games..)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>You probaly know the famous action replay. It was cool!
However it was slow, partly bugged and missed major commands. When aga
came out there was no toy for those machines. No real update came out -
the software version of the action replay was buggy like... . TK is a freezer
like the action replay, a lot commands have the same syntax. If you were
used to ar then you will find usage very easy. TK supports a maximum of
freezer possibility, if you take the time to check out all available functions/settings.
This means you have to have major knowledge of your amiga-hardware. If
you do not have it then i doubt that you can use the real power of this
toy! Of course, TK can not offer such kind of invisibility like the ar
as it does not need a 'special' hardware (beside a <A HREF="#TK_NMI">NMI-button</A>).
If you enjoy the demo version, think its useful and do not want to register
do not wait for a <B>cracked</B> version. Every registrated version of
TK has its own personal id. Any misuse of a <A HREF="#TK_Registration">registered
version</A> will be punished (!!!).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Just a last note! TK patches nearly the whole system!
It can not be compatible with any hardware configuration available (eg
gfxcards..). I give <B>no warranty</B> for any damage caused by TK! <B>You
use it on your own risk!</B></FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=-2>BTW: The html-documentation is best viewed with NETSCAPE3.0,
else read the text version!</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>TK was designed to run on a system with a mmu, but it
also works on non-mmu system. I use tk on a A4000 with 68030/25/68882 (with
mmu) and 2 meg chip and 8 meg fast memory. I personally think it works
very stable. However even some A4000 have strange behaviour when acessing
non existing memory. (eg Goldmans' machine: accessing memory higher $0fffffff
will cause not a bus-error (set to dsack) but it kicks around with the
custom-regs - they are defintly lost.) As you are a <B>talented</B> user
you can change the settings to suit for your configuration (eg disable
the memory detection for the $1dc00000++ memory) and load them before TK
is initialized!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>TK was tested on:</FONT></P>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>A1200/30.50.mmu/2mb-chip/8mb-fast at $1dc00000++ (blizzard3,
however Icarus reported trouble with the blizzard2..i will check this )</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>A4000/40.25.mmu/2mb-chip/8mb-fast at $7800000++ (thanx
to apollo for lending me his card, i hope it stills runs on 040 as i patched
a lot of stuff since then)</FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I can not promise that TK will run immediatly on your
system. However if you have problems <A HREF="#TK_Contact">contact</A>
me, i will try to fix any incompatibility! So if the demo-version runs
on your computer then the registered version will also work fine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>Before i forget it you need kickstart 3.0++ to use all
functions (especially the ones to privatize memory). It works also fine
with kick 2.04 (some functions will not work), but i do not think it will
run suitable on kickstarts less 2.04! TK does not like programms that use
the mmu (like vmm programms) TK does not support gfx-cards!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope it will also run on a 68060...not checked yet (also
i think it should if it works on 68040..)</FONT></P>

- General usage</FONT></B>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></DT></CENTER>

<DT><FONT SIZE=-1>Here is a list of some (maybe) interesting topics:</FONT></DT>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Breakpoints</B>(=brp) can be manipulated by <A HREF="#COM_B">B</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_BS">BS</A>, <A HREF="#COM_BD">BD</A>, <A HREF="#COM_BDA">BDA</A>.
Breakpoints can be marked with <A HREF="#COM_BTI">illegal</A> or <A HREF="#COM_BT">trap
codes</A> (see&nbsp;<A HREF="#TK_ThePreferences">preferences</A>). Whenever
you enter TK all breakpoints are removed, when you leave TK they are set
again. Do not forget that the breakpoints run via the +$10/$80..$bc vectors.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>MemoryAccessRanges</B>(=mar) can be used to get out
which command did a read/write access to the selected memory. The programm
will be trace step-by-step and the commands will be analyzed.It will return
to TK before the specified memory is accessed. MARs are very slow and will
not catch interrups. (If you want to catch interrupts than eg set a breakpoint
to the first command of the interrupt code..) Check <A HREF="#COM_MAV">MAV</A>,<A HREF="#COM_MAS">MAS</A>,<A HREF="#COM_MAD">MAD</A>,<A HREF="#COM_MADA">MADA</A>.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>MemoryWatchPoints</B>(=mwp) can be used to get out
which command modified the selected memory. The programm will be traced
step-by-step to determinate all manipulations. It will return to TK after
the specified memory has benn modfied. (so check the previous command)
MWPs are slow and will not catch interrupt routines. (If you want to catch
interrupts than eg set a breakpoint to the first command of the interrupt
code..) Check <A HREF="#COM_MV">MV</A>, <A HREF="#COM_MS">MS</A>, <A HREF="#COM_MD">MD</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_MDA">MDA</A>.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>The <B>VBR-Faker</B> installs a own vbr who simulates
the origional. This will allow you to enter programms who manipulate the
vectors at $0 and do not change the vbr. If the programm should change
the vbr, loacte the command, set a breakpoint and adjust the vbr manually,
skip the command and leave - all should be fine. (In AR4,HRTMON this is
default, but not in TK!) Do this also if the programm move the vbr anywhere
else. (see <A HREF="#TK_ThePreferences">preferences</A>)</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>MMU-Catchlists</B> can be changed by <A HREF="#COM_MMUV">MMUV</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_MMUS">MMUS</A>, <A HREF="#COM_MMUSW">MMUSW</A>, <A HREF="#COM_MMUD">MMUD</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_MMUDA">MMUDA</A> and check the <A HREF="#TK_ThePreferences">preferences</A>.
The function allows you a quick and reliable way to get out all commands
which access a certain memory range. This slows the system just a bit down.
Interrupt code is also checked. Make sure that the +$8 (bus-error) vector
is not destroyed by the programm. The functions are only available in to
professional version and require a MMU!</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>The <B>ByteValueTrainer</B>(=bvt) allows to search single
byte values. The trainer is started with the <A HREF="#COM_TS">TS</A> command.
Whenever the watched value changes run the <A HREF="#COM_T">T</A>command.(also
if you think this would eliminate some address) This will eleminate all
invalid address and scan yet not checked address. You must increase the
size of the trainer-buffer if you would like to scan the whole memory in
one pass. Check <A HREF="#COM_TS">TS</A>, <A HREF="#COM_T">T</A>, <A HREF="#COM_TX">TX</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_TV">TV</A>, <A HREF="#COM_TB">TB</A>,<A HREF="#COM_TBD">TBD</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_TBV">TBV</A>. Each stored address needs about 2 bytes.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>The <B>DeepTrainer</B>(=dt) allows you to search staying/changing
byte values. The trainer is started with the <A HREF="#COM_TDS">TDS</A>
command. Whenever the watched value changes run the <A HREF="#COM_TDC">TDC</A>
command to eliminate all address which have not changed. Use the <A HREF="#COM_TDS">TDS</A>
command to elimnate all address which have changed. After TDS/TDS the yet
unchecked memory is checked. Each stored address needs about 3 bytes. This
trainer mode needs a lot of memory. In general its advised to use an external
trainer buffer (<A HREF="#COM_TB">TB</A>, <A HREF="#COM_TBV">TBV</A>, <A HREF="#COM_TBD">TBD</A>)
Check also <A HREF="#COM_TDS">TDS</A>, <A HREF="#COM_TDC">TDC</A>, <A HREF="#COM_TDX">TDX</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_TDV">TDV</A></FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>The usage of a external <B>TrainerBuffer</B> is recommended
whenever you want to scan a memory range in a few passes, especially for
the deep-trainer. Its not unusual to have buffers with a size of 4MB or
more..</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Privatizing</B> is a <A HREF="#TK_ThePreferences">preference</A>
option which allows you to remove memory from the system. This memory can
be used for trainer-buffer, to freeze the programm or for other purpose.
Check also <A HREF="#COM_IN">INFO</A>.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>MMU-CustomBackup</B> is a option which simulates a
mirror ram for $dff000-$dff200. By this way we do not need an external
hardware which does exactly this. The only disadvantage is that the system
is slowed down and the +$8(bus-error) vector is used.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Labels</B> are just a little short-cut for often used
address, etc. They can be easily in any expression. Check <A HREF="#">LAB</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_DLAB">DLAB</A> ,<A HREF="#COM_DLABA">DLABA</A>.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1><B>FileSystemManagement</B> is supported for DD/HD-disks
and also IDE-harddisk-partitions. Only DOS\0, DOS\1, DOS\2, DOS\3 are supported.
However also DOS\4, DOS\5 can be read. Soft-/Hardlinks are not supported.
Check <A HREF="#COM_CD">CD</A>, <A HREF="#COM_DIR">DIR</A>, <A HREF="#COM_DELETE">DELETE</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_MAKEDIR">MAKEDIR</A>, <A HREF="#COM_TYPE">TYPE</A>, <A HREF="#COM_LM">LM</A>,
<A HREF="#COM_SM">SM</A>.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>The programm '<B>TK.REV</B>' allows you to load TK to
the end of the available memory. This needs kickstart 3.0++. The effect
is that TK will not lay somewhere in the middle of a memory page (especiilly
if you privatize memory). Make sure 'TK.EXE' is in the same path.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>'<B>TK.EXE</B>' will not do dynamic allocation of memory.
This means you can relocate the code eg to $7f00000 and load its binary
image to this address.</FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>I would advise to use the internal 150-pin expansion
connector.The ipl-lines are at pin 81, 82, 83 and the ground is eg at pin

installed try so solder on the connector of it.<BR>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=-1>I would advise to use the internal 200-pin expansion connector
of the cpu-card, because all other connectors do not support the ipl-signals
(including the Zorro2/3 slots<B>!!</B>). Unfortunatly, i have not found
a description where all signals are described with correct pin numbers,
so i will just give a exact pin-location. If you have a manual where the
pins are described try to contact me. You should solder on the upper side
(the one where the connector pins are soldered to the card). The following
instructions were tested on a A4000 with a 68030 and 68040 original cpu
card. It should also work with the cyberstorm cards! (<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">not

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>The internal 86-pin-MMU-connector of the A2000 has the
same pin assignment as the A500 86-pin connector. However if want to use
a Zorro2-slot then you need just to connect the <B>EINT7</B>-signal (pin
40) directly via a button to a ground signal (eg pin 37). Take a look at
your A2000 manual for verification.</FONT></LI>
