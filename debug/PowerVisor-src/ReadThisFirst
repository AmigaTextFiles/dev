PowerVisor V1.43    CopyRight © Jorrit Tyberghein (Jul 94)
----------------

   PowerVisor is a powerful debugger designed to do almost everything
   you can think of. Even if you can't think of it it will probably still be
   possible :-)

   What I meant to say with the above is that PowerVisor is
   rather complex to use. I recommend that you read the tutorial sections
   even if you think you can cope. Once you have mastered the program
   you will probably be able to debug your programs in a very short
   time.

   Note that I TRY to make PowerVisor as user friendly as possible (look
   at the emphasis on the word 'try').

   Read the tutor files and execute each command as mentioned
   there. All lines you have to type are preceded by a '<'. Some special
   keys are notated as <key>. <enter> is used for the return key.
   All output from PowerVisor is preceded by a '>'.
   If you must press two keys together there is a '+' between them:
   <alt>+<enter>.

   If you have AmigaGuide or MultiView (© Commodore) it is best that you
   use this program to read the PowerVisor manual.

   All input and output in this tutorial is for the AmigaDOS 2.0/3.0
   version. In most cases this does not matter. If there are
   differences between the two versions it is mentioned in the tutorial
   in the following form: (1.3 : .......)
   PowerVisor also works fine in AmigaDOS 3.0 and later.


Shareware and disclaimer
------------------------

   PowerVisor is shareware. This means that you can copy it and give
   to everybody. If you like the program and/or use it, I'd appreciate
   it if you send me a contribution. If you send $25 US or more
   you automatically get the next major release when one is available
   (I will also add you to the list of registered users).
   PLEASE send money by international money order, EuroCheck (in Belgian
   Francs (BEF) !) or cash, because it's very difficult for me to cash
   in other checks !
   If you want an update please state your current version.

   Note that PowerVisor may only be redestributed with ALL FILES
   PRESENT (especially this file). Below follows a list of all files
   in the PowerVisor distribution.

   NOTHING in the PowerVisor distribution may be redistributed seperately
   or used in any commercial product without prior permission from
   the author.

   Note that the quickhelp utilities ('MakeHelp', 'ArcFiles', 'Help',
   'MakeHelp13', 'ArcFiles13' and 'Help13') are considered seperate
   from PowerVisor. You may redistribute the quickhelp utilities
   without the rest of PowerVisor if you really want to (read the
   'Help.doc' file for possible restrictions).

   You can order the source of PowerVisor if you like. Simply read the
   'HowToGetTheSource' file included in this archive.

   ReqTools is CopyRight © Nico François.

   PowerVisor is no longer in beta stage. I don't know if PowerVisor
   already deserves this, but some people insisted that it was time
   that I removed the beta label, so I did it. The fact that PowerVisor
   is not beta does not mean that there are no bugs left :-)  But
   I think that PowerVisor is stable enough (at least the AmigaDOS 2.0
   version looks stable enough) to make it a really usable program
   (I use it :-)

   I (THE AUTHOR) TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR DAMAGES INFLICTED BY
   POWERVISOR AND THE OTHER PROGRAMS IN THIS DISTRIBUTION. YOU ARE
   COMPLETELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL EFFECTS OF USING POWERVISOR
   AND ANY OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !


Note about processors
---------------------

   This version is an intermediate version. I intend to support all
   Motorola processors (68020, 68030, 68040, ...) in future versions
   (especially for the mmu protection system). I was only planning
   to release PowerVisor when this system was ready but several
   people wanted a new version sooner. Therefore I release a version
   of PowerVisor (1.43) with a shaky memory protection system that ONLY
   WORKS ON THE 68030. I tested the protection system on my Amiga 3000
   and it seemed to work but I don't make any guarantees. Wait for one
   of the next versions for full support.

   All other things should work though.


Note about source-level debugging
---------------------------------

   I want to support source-level debugging as good as possible.
   Therefore I need debug hunks :-)  If you have a compiler or
   assembler that outputs debug information that PowerVisor does not
   understand, please send some sample source, object files and
   executables to me (or else a textual description of the format
   if available). With that information I may be able to include
   support for that particular compiler or assembler.


Note about AmigaOS 1.2 and 1.3
------------------------------

   For the moment I try to support AmigaOS 1.2 and 1.3 if possible
   (with a seperate version of PowerVisor). But I don't have 1.3 anymore
   and I know nobody who is capable of running 1.3 on his machine.
   So PowerVisor for AmigaOS 1.2 or 1.3 is NOT TESTED AT ALL.


Short feature list
------------------

   o Fullscreen debugger

   o Full symbolic debugging

   o Very powerful tracing and breakpoint commands. You can trace until
     a certain condition becomes true, or trace just before the next
     branch, or trace until a certain register changes, ... PowerVisor has
     profiler breakpoints, conditional breakpoints and a lot more

   o Primitive source level debugging (C, assembler, ...) In future
     more will be possible

   o PowerVisor is compatible with the 68000, 68020 and 68030. The 68040
     is also supported (in the disassembler for example) although some
     features don't work on that processor (like memory protection) due
     to lack of information

   o Memory protection system. With this system you can read or write
     protect ranges of memory for all or some tasks

   o PowerVisor can show the MMU registers and special 68020/30 registers

   o Primitive floating point support (display and modify registers). In
     future more will be possible (like expressions)

   o Powerful ARexx interface

   o Intuition menus and gadtools scrollbars (AmigaDOS 2.0 version only)

   o The PowerVisor screen is a public screen (only for AmigaDOS 2.0)

   o Powerful expression evaluator. Almost all C operators are supported
     and some additional operators as well

   o Online help system with AmigaGuide or MultiView (for AmigaDOS 3.0)
     or internal system

   o Very customizable: screen or window on WorkBench, fonts, colours,
     menus, multiple windows, ...
     You can add your own PowerVisor commands with aliases
     All keys can be redefined and you can add macros or commands to
     any key you want

   o You can call any library function you want from within PowerVisor.
     With this feature you can test existing library functions or you
     can test your own libraries

   o Powerful stack usage checker. With this command you can see how
     much stack a program uses

   o Resource tracker. With this command you can see how much memory
     a program allocates (and how much memory it doesn't deallocate),
     all allocated signals, all locks and open files

   o Profiler. With this system you can see which routines use much
     CPU time and are useful to optimize

   o Crash trapping

   o You can kill and freeze tasks

   o Powerful tag and structure system. With this system you can define
     structures in PowerVisor. The disassembler will recognize these
     structures if possible and it will use names for all offsets instead
     of numbers. This makes debugging a lot easier

   o PowerVisor can list almost anything: tasks, libraries, devices, ports,
     resident modules, autoconfig devices, dos devices, windows, screens,
     fonts, ...
     In addition PowerVisor can dump the internal structures of many
     operating system elements like tasks, processes, CLI structures, ...

   o You can open any Exec device from within PowerVisor and send commands
     to it. This is useful for debugging your own devices

   o You can monitor the usage of a library function. Each time the
     library function is called PowerVisor will perform some action (like
     printing a message, or storing the information from the call in a
     buffer, or simply blinking the powerled)

   o PowerVisor can list the gadgets of a window

   o PowerVisor can remove a lot of things like tasks, resident modules,
     input handlers, windows, screens, ...


I'm sorry
---------

   I'm sorry for my bad English. I speak Dutch and English is
   only my second language. The tutorial files as they are in
   the current distribution are NOT corrected at all. I didn't
   even reread everything. I'd very much appreciate corrections of the
   online help and the tutorial files.


Compatibility with PowerVisor V1.32
-----------------------------------

      - Tag files are not compatible anymore (due to a bug fix). If you
        want to convert the old pre-V1.40 tag files to the new format
        you must change the last four bytes (00000000 in the old file
        format) to FFFFFFFF (or -1)
      - 'pvcall 65' is obsolete (it is not harmful to call this
        routine, since it is replaced by an equivalent, but less
        powerful and less useful, routine)
      - Several changes everywhere (see 'TheWizCorner.guide') because
        the 'mode' command was completely rewritten
      - PowerVisor-config file has changed a little bit. It is
        still possible to use the old config file, but it is better
        that you delete this file and make a new one


Compatibility with PowerVisor V1.31
-----------------------------------

   Due to large internal changes (memory management) there have been
   some changes. Here follow all things that have changed that
   could cause compatibility problems for specialized scripts.
   If you have made specialized ARexx programs, scripts or ML-scripts
   you will probably have to change some things :

      - 'pvcall 59' is obsolete. This is because the complete
        'PVQuickBlock' system has been removed. Note that you
        can use 'pvcall 58' instead
      - mbase_GlobalAutoClear is now a 'PVMemoryBlock' instead of
        a 'PVQuickBlock'
      - mbase_PVQuickTressHold is obsolete
      - mbase_ResidentCode is now a 'PVMemoryBlock' instead of
        a 'PVQuickBlock'
      - The 'PVQuickBlocks' in the 'debug node' have also been changed
        to 'PVMemoryBlocks'
      - 'base_CliCmdLineLen' has been replaced by 'base_Detach'
      - 'PVCallStub.lib' and 'PVCallStubNB.lib' have changed
        (new PvCall functions)
      - There is an extra field in the logical window structure
      - There is an extra field in the debug structure
      - There are some extra fields in the debug structure that were
        previously used for other things


Compatibility with PowerVisor V1.10ß to V1.12ß
----------------------------------------------

   PowerVisor was still in beta release. This means that big changes
   were unavoidable :

      - The 'ScreenBase' structure (see 'TheWizardCorner') has changed.
        You will probably have to change and recompile all scripts
        using 'ScreenBase'
      - The 'PowerVisor-config' file is not compatible


Compatibility with PowerVisor V1.00ß and V1.01ß
-----------------------------------------------

      - 'refresh' ALWAYS expects two arguments. The second
        argument (command) is no longer optional
      - New 'pvcall 17' and other pvcall commands
      - New strong quote operator (·)
      - The '#' operator is removed. Replace it with the '\' operator :
               #<var>     ---->     \(<var>,%s)
      - The 'eval' function expects a string pointer instead of a string
      - The 'libfunc' command expects a negative argument instead of
        a positive one
      - The <maximum number of functions> argument is removed from
        the 'loadfd' command
      - 'memory', 'view' and 'unasm' work differently when another
        number of bytes is used (see documentation)
      - All error numbers have changed because the obsolete error
        numbers are removed
      - The 'PVSD' fileformat ('loadtags', 'savetags') has changed.
        There is no way to convert. You need the original source
        (.struct file)
      - 'why' command is gone and is replaced with an alias in
        the standard PowerVisor-startup file
      - Many fields described in 'TheWizardCorner' have changed. Some
        pvcall functions have become obsolete and DO NOT work anymore.
        Some pvcall functions have been REPLACED with others
      - The PowerVisor expression evaluator is more strict. You MUST
        close ALL brackets (also {} brackets)
      - PowerVisor commands called from ARexx are not interruptable anymore
        with <esc>
      - Important change in the logical window system. (See the changes
        section for more details)
      - Major change in the history buffer mechanics. The history
        buffer list has changed (see 'TheWizardCorner')
      - The File format of s:PowerVisor-config has changed !
        Please delete this file first before you start the new version of
        PowerVisor !!!
      - Commandline options for PowerVisor are removed since they were
        not very useful
      - 'scan' works differently. You don't need to free the string
        allocated with 'scan'. The pointer to the input string is
        NOT returned in 'rc' but in the predefined constant 'INPUT'
      - The number of pens in the pentable has changed from 16 to 24


The development cycle
---------------------

   I started development of PowerVisor (February 1989) on an Amiga
   500 with two diskdrives and one megabyte of memory. (except for
   holidays, I only programmed in the weekends since I was at my
   university for the rest of the week)
   PowerVisor (at that time called 'PowerBase') was going to be a
   structure viewer. The 'list' and 'info' commands are in fact the
   most ancient commands in PowerVisor (except maybe the 'quit'
   command :-)
   At that time I did not think about writing a debugger. I could
   not even write one if I wanted to. After all, PowerVisor was
   only my second machinelanguage program on Amiga and I was still
   learning machinelanguage.
   (my first program in machinelanguage was a little program to
   blink the powerled, I made this program together with someone
   else :-)
   (In fact PowerVisor is also my last machinelanguage program, I
   normally program in C)

   I bought my first harddrive about five months later (30 megs).

   In September 1990 I bought my Amiga 3000/16/40! Needless to say
   this was a great development boost. I almost immediately expanded
   my Amiga to 4 megabytes of memory.

   In August 1991 I bought a second harddrive (52 megs) for my Amiga 3000.

   In January 1994 I bought my third harddrive (100 megs).

   At this moment (March 1994) the PowerVisor source is
   approximately 47000 lines long and all other ascii files
   (help files, scripts, ...) approach approximately 40000 lines.

   Conclusion : If I were to start all over again, I would not use
   machinelanguage (or perhaps only for the exception handling and
   other special code). It is too much work. At this moment I don't
   regret my choice of machinelanguage, but this is only because I
   already have programmed all support routines and making some new
   PowerVisor command or other feature is simply a matter of calling
   the right routines (more or less).


Bugs
----

   PowerVisor was programmed on an Amiga 3000 with AmigaDOS 2.0.
   I have tested the program on AmigaDOS 1.3 and everything seemed
   to work. I have tested PowerVisor on the Amiga 500 and on the
   Amiga 4000.

   I know that the MMU protection system will NOT work on a 68040.
   As long as I don't know anyone personally with such a system I can't
   solve the bugs in this area.

   PowerVisor is a big program. This means that bugs are unavoidable.
   If you find some bugs, or have some suggestions please write.
   I'd like PowerVisor to be as bug free as possible.
   In this distribution there is a file 'pv.bugs' describing all bugs
   in the current version. Consult this file if you discover some
   weird behaviour.

   Give (at least) the following information when you report a bug :

     docs (dir)               All documents for PowerVisor
                              Use AmigaGuide or MultiView to read these
                              documents if you have this program. However,
                              the files are quiet readable with a normal
                              text viewer and they can be converted to be
                              even more readable (see ConvertGuide2Doc).

                              This utility removes all special AmigaGuide
                              commands and makes the file somewhat more
                              readable with a normal textviewer.
                              Use this utility if you don't have MultiView

  InstallPV                   Install script for AmigaDOS 2.0 (uses the
                              'Installer' program). Double click from
                              the Workbench to use




   WARNING! Some of these files may be compressed. Each file with
   extension '.qq' must be decompressed with the 'dc' utility (note
   that the install script does this automatically) like this (for
   example for the 'PowerVisor-help' file) (don't use wildcards) :

       dc PowerVisor-help.qq PowerVisor-help 4
       delete PowerVisor-help.qq


Environment
-----------

   PowerVisor normally does not expect special assignments or such.
   s/PowerVisor-startup however does expect 'fd' to be assigned to
   the subdirectory containing fd-files (at least exec_lib.fd,
   dos_lib.fd, graphics_lib.fd and intuition_lib.fd). If you do not
   have these fd-files (note that you can find them on the AmigaDOS
   1.3 Extras disk) you must remove four lines in s/PowerVisor-startup
   starting with '-lfd'. You will not be able to use the library
   functions defined in the fd-files if you do this (Note that
   PowerVisor makes very good use of these fd-files, so I recommend
   that you install them if you have a harddisk).

   If you want to use AmigaGuide or MultiView to read the PowerVisor
   documentation you also need to assign 'pv:' to the root of the
   PowerVisor subdirectory (so that MultiView can find the documentation
   in 'pv:docs'). The installation script automatically changes your
   startup-sequence (it will ask first!) to include this and the 'fd:'
   assign.

   s/PowerVisor-startup and all the aliases defined in this script also
   expects the following files in the s:pv directory : db, CheckBrackets,
   GetCode, GetQual, SearchHist, assem.pv, cmd.pv and searchkeyword.pv.

   You can of course adapt s:PowerVisor-startup to your own wishes.


   If you have reqtools.library (by Nico François) PowerVisor will use
   it for requesters.


   If you use AmigaDOS 1.2 or 1.3 I recommend that you use
   'FastFonts' (FF) by C.Heath. This program greatly speeds up the
   PowerVisor display. This is not necessary in AmigaDOS 2.0 since
   Commodore did a good optimizing job.

   If you use AmigaDOS 1.2, 1.3, 2.0 or 3.0 and you have a fast processor
   (68020 or higher) I recommend that you use 'CpuBlit' by Eddy Carroll.
   This program gives an even greater speed increase.


Installation
------------

   Look at the 'HowToInstall' file for a very detailed description of
   the installation of PowerVisor.


Tutor files
-----------

Here are all the files in the prefered order to read them.
It is best to read these files with AmigaGuide or MultiView (if you have
one of these programs).

Thanks to
---------

   André Pelckmans for his disassembler and for giving me all
   the programming help I need.
   Without him I wouldn't have a computer in the first place (I think).
   I also got my 68030 manual from him.

   Nico François for his debugging, his numerous remarks and suggestions.
   Without him PowerVisor would have looked COMPLETELY different :-)
   (and without him I would have to use two disks to backup the source
   of PowerVisor)

   Nico François for his WONDERFUL reqtools.library. If you want to use
   well designed, flexible and powerful requesters there is no better choice.

   Ives Aerts for his useful suggestions and criticism.

   Adam Hill, Christian Weber, Steven Reiz and Dominic Giampaolo
   for their bug reports and suggestions.

   Some extra thanks to Adam Hill for his efforts to arouse
   interrest in PowerVisor (in BIX for example).

   Adriaan van den Brand for his good suggestions and information.
   For the fixing of the MMU bug for an 68020 (see V1.31)
   And for the floating point routines.

   John Harper for his bug fix for address errors on the 68000.

   The software people at Commodore for their VERY USEFUL debugging
   tools (like 'Enforcer', 'MungWall', ...).
   And also for their presence on usenet.

   To all the users of PowerVisor who send bug reports and enhancements
   requests (sorry if your request didn't make it yet).

   To my parents of course.

   To ... Veerle ... for everything.

   Also thanks to the Amiga computer for being an Amiga.
