Here a short explanation for all new features in PowerVisor (the new
documentation is not ready yet, the online help is a little bit
ready):

   - old MMU 'watch' command renamed to 'mmuwatch'

   - new 'debug s' commands:
          'debug s' show the current path that will be used to locate the
                    source files for the program that you are debugging.
                    By default this is only the current directory.
          'debug s a <path>'
                    add a new path
          'debug s c'
                    clear the path completely

   - new 'watch' commands:
          'watch c' clear all watches for the current task
          'watch a <address>'
                    add a watch for the current debug task
          'watch r <address>'
                    remove a watch
          'watch s'
                    show all watches and their contents. If something
                    changes since the previous 'watch s' it will be
                    hilighted.

   - new 'wwin' command to open the watch logical window.
