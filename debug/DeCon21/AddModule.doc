Introduction
============

   AddModule is able to install resident modules to KickTag and KickMem lists,
which makes them reset-proof.

Syntax: AddModule <ModuleName> [CLASS <class>] [PRI <pri>] [INIT]

ModuleName - name of resident module you want to install
     class - module class 0-127 (see exec/resident.i). The seventh bit cannot
             be overriden
       pri - module priority -128-127

   You may also try to install usual libraries and devices as resident modules.
In this case, specify CLASS 4 and PRI -128. If some library uses some other,
try to arrange the priorities in the appropriate order. The ss.library can be
installed in this way.

   If the module is already present in the same or higher version and with the
same or higher priority, it's not installed again.

   AddModule is pure and can be made resident.


Requirements
============

   - Kickstart 2.04 or higher

   - ss.library 5.0 or higher (included in this archive)
