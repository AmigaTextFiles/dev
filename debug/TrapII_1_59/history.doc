New in 1.3: (1.1 & 1.2 were just bug fixes)
1) Safer task restarting: version 1.2 could make a mess of the target's
   signals if there were interrupts and other tasks talking to the target.
   Because of this new code not only is Forbid() used (correctly this time),
   but for about 20 clock cycles (68000), Disable() is too.
2) target_wait code changed to support Disable().

New in 1.4:
1) Got rid of the screen moving thing, and changed the screen to front so
   that it calls ScreenToFront(wd's screen) instead WBenchToFront()

New in 1.6: (1.5 was bug fix)
1) Changed window gadgets so that [Off] is gone (use rmb), [OK/Ignore] is
   gone (use close gadget), and a new one, [Trace], is given. With trace
   you can step through your code instruction by instruction, until you
   are tired of this, and just hit [Restart].
2) Safe handling of USP. Now your task can use a7 for anything it desires-
   it does not have to point to a stack. TrapII allocates a mini-stack
   for the target to use when the target is being shutdown and restarted.
3) Got rid of the ScreenToFront() when the TrapII window opens altogether.

New in 1.7
1) Added [Next] gadget & function.
2) Window is no longer closed after [Restart], [Trace] or [Next] is pressed.
   This saves a lot of time on a clogged wb screen, and reminds you that
   the task is off doing something.
3) Changed the offset/segment finding code so that if the target is started
   from WB the offset/segment can still be found, and so that if the segment
   list seems too long (i.e. corrupted), we are not in a perpetual loop

New in 1.8
1) Added keyboard equivalents for the gadgets:
   [Next] = N
   [Trace] = T
   [Restart] = R
2) Fixed bug in TrapII which was generating address errors (which I traced by
   having two TrapIIs running one on top of the other, and using the second
   to trace through the first!)

New in 1.9
1) Added keyboard equivalents for close and sleep
   Close/Ok/Ignore = O
   Sleep = Z
2) Added support for [Next]ing through loops which end in BCC
3) Window deiconifies when a key is pressed (well, most keys)

New in 1.10
1) Fixed window closing code in hope of avoiding crashes.

New in 1.11
1) Found that bug!, and fixed it for good. (the one where if you click twice
   on anything really quickly then you get an addr error).
2) Changed wd closing code to use arp.library's CloseWindowSafely()

New in 1.11b
1) Bug fix of bug in version distributed to ab20 (sorry).

1.11c was not distributed, and the change was not functional.

New in 1.11d
1) Got rid of the arp.library stuff. The arp.library in no longer needed.
2) Added support for the 68010--both correctly trapping it and starting
   it up again.
   Also the 68020s stack frames are understood.
   However the 68020s cache is NOT flushed, so you must run with the
   cache disabled or the [Next] function may not always work.
3) Added support for restarting after a BKPT instruction. This works
   identically to restarting after a TRAP instruction, and even works on
   a 68000.

New in 1.12
1) Cache flushing is done properly using CacheClearE(); should work with
   any cache settings now.
2) Needs 2.04 or better (because of cache flushing)
3) Doesn't stomp TC_TRAPCODE when restarting the target. (because my
   profile.library doesn't appreciate this)
4) Changed [Next] to use a BKPT #0 instead of a TRAP #0 to keep
   interactions w/ custom trap handlers that use TRAP #0 down. I
   figure that fewer people will be using BKPT than TRAP. (also
   for my profile.library)

New in 1.13
1) Removed 'O' equivalent for close-window, since it didn't make sense.
2) Added a cache flush in one place where it was needed and had been
   missed. (When you close the window while Nexting), and fixed bug there.
3) Removed some redudant Forbid()s (Disable() was also being called)
4) Fixed height of zipped window, and used 2.0 zoom gadget. (and got rid
   of rmb zipping)
5) Made window font sensative (somewhat--if the given font isn't fixed
   width then various defaults are tried, stretching back to topaz 8)

At this point I switched to using my revision.i system, so revisions
are incremented automatically each time I add a comment, and each time
I restart work on the program after having shutdown. Here is the comment
section from revision.i, with irrelevent comments deleted:

* 1.15 (10:54PM 29.11.94): rewriting open_window code, backup
* 1.26 (7:22AM 09.12.94): big bug in new_TrapCode rol.w fixed. How did it ever work before? backup
* 1.32 (10:37PM 20.12.94): going to change restart code so it doesn't rely on a particular stack
* 1.44 (1:49PM 22.12.94): unlimited Nexts code added, now debugging
* 1.49 (2:21PM 24.12.94): added am/pm to timestamp
* 1.50 (2:55PM 24.12.94): unlimited nexts work, backup
* 1.54 (2:58PM 27.12.94): It seems that GVP cards use the BKPT instruction!, so I cannot use it. I am switching the [Next] to using ILLEGAL
* 1.57 (9:06PM 30.12.94): added restoration of TC_MEMENTRY in do_kill
