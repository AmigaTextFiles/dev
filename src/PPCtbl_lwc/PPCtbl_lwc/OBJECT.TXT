The converter (v3.4) currently supports the following:

 6 diffrent kinds of polygons (plus 4 transparency variations)

  * Flat-shaded polygons
  * Texture-mapped polygons
  * Reflection-mapped polygons
  * Texture+reflection-mapped polygons
  * Bump+Reflection-mapped polygons
  * Bump+Texture+reflection-mapped polygons

 For all 6 type you can have the following transparencey settings:

  * Texture 0 transparency. This means that every pixel that's 0 in the
   texture will be 100% transparent. If this mode is used on a 
   normally flatshaded surface a special halfbright transparence is 
   used.
  * Additive transparence the R,G,B value for every dot in the
   polygon vill be absoulte added to the background colour.
  * Subtractive transparence the R,G,B value for every dot in the
   polygon vill be absoulte subtracted to the background colour.
  * RGB higher transparence. ie the highest of the R,G,B values
   of the polygon point and the background colour.

 There is one special transparence mode and that is halfbright. In this mode
 the background colour is made half as bright as it was before. Note that
 this mode is MUCH faster than the other transparency modes.
 
 
 How to use the transparency:  
 
  * Set transparency to less then 5% for no transparency
  * Set transparency to 5-25% for texture 0 transparency
   NOTE if a flat-shaded polygon is used with this transparency mode a
   special halfbright drawing mode is used. 
  * Set transparency to 25-50% for subtractive transparency
  * Set transparency to 50-75% for additive transparency
  * Set transparency to higher then 75% for RGB-higher transparency
 

 (NOTE! There are no such things as only bump or bump+texture,because bump
  needs a light to have any effect. Bump+flat and bump+texture will work as
  flat and texture only.)
  
How to modell objects:

  (This explain the surface settings for every type of mapping)
  
0  Flat:
    Colour:     R,G,B This sets the colour for the surface
    Luminosity: Colour brightness,ie 0=Backdrop,100=Colour
    
1  Texture:
    All textures must:
     * Be an IFF-ILBM file.
     * Contain no more then 256 colours.
     * Be not wider then 256 pixels, or less then 8 pixels.
     * Have a minimum height of 8.
     * Be a mutiple of 8 pixels wide.(width=n*8) 64,128,192..
    The mapping modes supported are:
     * Planar Image Map
     * Spherical Image Map
     * Cylindrical Image Map
    Does support:
     * Moving of Center
     * All texture axis (X,Y,Z)
     * Scaling
     
    Colour:     R,G,B Colour change of texture. Normal= 128,128,128
    Luminosity: Strength of colour,0=Flat,100=Normal texture colour

2  Reflectionmap:
   (Really 2 modes of reflection,image reflection and phong-mapping)

   Phong reflection:

    Colour:     R,G,B This sets the colour for the surface
    Luminosity: Colour brightness,ie 0=Backdrop,100=Colour
    Diffusion:  0=Flat shaded with spot,100 edges at backdrop colour
    Specularity:0%=No spot,100%=Spot at Ambient colour
    Glossiness: Size of lightspot.Low=Big spotlight,Huge=Small spot
    Reflection: Reflectivity. 0=Flat shaded,100=Full
    
   Image reflection:
   
    All reflectiontextures must:
     * Be an IFF-ILBM file.
     * Contain no more then 256 colours.
     * Be not wider then 256 pixels, or less then 8 pixels.
     * Have a minimum height of 8.
     * Have a width of 2^x pixels i.e 8,16,32,64,128,256
     * The height same as the width. i.e 128x128,256x256 etc
     * If bumpmapping is used be 256x256 in size.
     * Use spherical image reflection. (Won't look the same as in LW!)

    Colour:     R,G,B.Colour change of reflectiontexture. 
                Normal= 128,128,128
    Luminosity: Strength of colour,0=Flat,100=Normal texture colour
    Reflection: Reflectivity. 0=Flat shaded,100=Image
        
3  Texture+Reflection-mapping:
   
   Reflection settings as for Reflectionmap
   Texture as texturemap
           
4  Bump+Reflection-mapping:

   All bumptextures must:
     * Be an IFF-ILBM file.
     * Contain no more then 256 colours.
     * Be not wider then 256 pixels, or less then 8 pixels.
     * Have a minimum height of 8.
     * Be a mutiple of 8 pixels wide.(width=n*8) 64,128,192...
     * If texturemapping are present have the same size as
      the texturemap.

   The bumpmapping modes supported are:
     * Planar Image Map
     * Spherical Image Map
     * Cylindrical Image Map

   NOTE! Colour 0=Lowest height,255=Highest
      
    Bump amplitude: 0%=Flat bump 100%=Strong bump
    
   
5  Bump+Texture+Reflection-mapping:

   Reflection settings as for Reflectionmap
   Texture as texturemap
   Bump as Bump+Reflection-mapping but:
   
    * Mapping method used will be the same as for the texture!!
