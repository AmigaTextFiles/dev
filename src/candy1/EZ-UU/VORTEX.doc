 ============================ DISTRIBUTION: ===============================
 
 You may distribute Vortex via ANY means possible. The Only
 restrictions:
 
 All files in this archive must be kept together when being
 distributed.. and the files may not be altered in any way.
 Also, any purely commercial venture (such as magazine coverdisk
 inclusion) where the program is being "sold".. is not allowed
 without first obtaining my permission.
 
 That's it! Follow that simple rule and you can give Vortex to
 anybody.. via any means you'd like :)
 
  =========================== CONTRIBUTION: ==============================
 
  I'm only asking $1-$5 for Vortex. Surely.. if you like Vortex
  you can afford to send at LEAST $1. I'd rather receive SOMETHING
  for my work than NOTHING :)
  
  The contribution is completely optional. If you hate the
  program I wouldn't expect you to send me anything :) BUT if
  you like Vortex ... please think about the contribution.

SEND TO:

Thanks for using Vortex.... I hope you like it!

Final Note on CONTRIBUTING:
 
I don't know how many times I've downloaded a GUI to a CLI
program.. and the author is asking $10-$25. Add that amount
to what the author of the CLI program may be asking and you've
got a fairly substantial amount.

In the case of Vortex, it's a stand alone program in many
respects (it has features that work independent of external
programs) and is also 5 or 6 GUI's rolled into one. Rather
than ask an outrageous amount (which I feel $25 would be)..
I decide to ask for only $1-$5. This allows you to register any
of the programs that Vortex may control/use.. and still AFFORD
to send a contribution for Vortex.
 
Please consider the contribution!
 

 =========================== AS-IS NOTICE ================================
 
 Vortex is released "AS-IS". I am NOT responsible for any damages
 as the result of Vortex directly or indirectly. This means that
 if you lose important data.. or your system blows up or something,
 I am NOT responsible.

 Vortex works on my system. It SHOULD work on yours. You use this
 program at your OWN risk.
 
 =========================================================================

System Requirements:
====================
 
- OS/WB 2.0+. Lower revisions may work... but you won't
  have the ability to drag'n drop into the vortex window (you'll
  be restricted to the file requester). This is also dependant
  on the requirements of external utilities you may wish to use.
 
- At least 1 meg of RAM is recommended... it may work in 512k.. but
  you probably won't be able to do much.
 
- For every feature of Vortex to be active.. you will need the
  following utilities in your command path.
 
  - UUXT and companion UUSplit utilities (for encode/decode options)
  - UUin (Encoder. Much faster and smaller than UUXT)
  - UUout (decoder. Much faster than UUxt.)
  - Lha, or Zip, or lzx or ALL THREE (for arc/unarc actions)
  - Sploin (for split and join options)
  - Vortex also relies on various DOS commands that should
    already be in your path. (copy, delete, relabel, etc.)
 
Please see the special notes at the end of these docs regarding
Encoders and decoders and compatibility.
 
INSTALLING VORTEX:
==================
 
Put Vortex and it's supporting files in the same directory.. which
can be located anywhere you like. Any supported external utilities
(lha, uuxt, etc.) should be in your command path (c:, etc.)

Vortex is distributed in TWO different forms:

- The file named "Vortex" is a stand-alone program.

- The file "Vortex.NEEDSLIB" is the SAME program but it will
  require that you have the Cando.Library in your libs: drawer.

The difference is SIZE. If you already have the cando.library
on your system... there's no need to use the stand-alone program
(which is much larger). Simply rename The "NEEDSLIB" version to
"vortex" and you're all set. The cando.library is copyrighted
so you may not have it on your system. If you don't... use
the stand-alone version.

  =======================================================================

                             INTRODUCTION:
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Open a Vortex on your workbench screen and enter a new dimension
in file handling. Split, Join, Encode, Decode, and manipulate/activate
files (view,run,text, etc.) by dropping them into the Vortex. If you
crave a more even handed or traditional approach to file selection..
a file requester is only a mouse-click away.
 
There are 6 built-in modules. 5 of these are dedicated to specific
tasks. Splitting, Joining, Encoding, Decoding and a DOS module. The 6th
is a multi-purpose, configurable module called the "Action" module. It
allows the user to create a wide range of actions specific to
various file types.
 
Vortex offers a lot of different ways to accomplish tasks that would
normally take you many steps via the CLI or via the use of
separate programs. Vortex puts it all together in a nice GUI.
Hopefully Vortex will incorporate an Arexx port in a
future release.
 
Vortex relies on a few separate CLI based utilities (that must
reside in your command path) to perform the "grunt" work for it's
operations. If you don't already own the required programs you must
obtain them via a shareware or p.d. source (BBS, Aminet, etc.). In
many cases Vortex does not simply provide a GUI to these programs..
it enhances their capabilities or adds extra options NOT available
from the CLI.
 
I did not included the required CLI utilities within this archive
because conflictions may occur with the distribution notices for
each utility. You should have no problem obtaining them (you
may already have them) and I have listed each required CLI program
in the SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS section.
 
Brief Description:
------------------

Vortex is a GUI that links, controls and enhances several
CLI based utilities designed for splitting, joining, encoding and
decoding files. Vortex also features a customizable "action" mode
that allows the program to perform a large assortment of actions via
external utilities. Vortex can be used via "drag and drop file
selection".... or has an easy to use file requester.
 
- If you send or receive UUencoded files... USE VORTEX!
- If you need to split or join files... GIVE VORTEX A TRY!
- If you need a simple "window on the workbench" to perform
  various tasks quickly and easily.... TRY VORTEX!
 

  ====================================================================


The Basics:
-----------

At first glance the small Vortex window may seem a bit short
on features. Looks can deceive! The options available
for each mode are selected via the OPS button and DRP button.
Toggle through each available mode (via the roll-over button)
and press the OPS button to get an idea of what Vortex can do!
Click DRP to see what the "DROPtions" are (these determine
how disks and directories are scanned.. and what happens when you
drop files, drawers and disks into the Vortex). The Available DROPtion
settings are the same for each mode.. but you can USE and SAVE a
different set of droptions for EACH mode. Needless to say.. you can
use and save OPTIONS for each mode as well. Each mode can also remember
its last directory (optional).. so when you set a destination for
SPLIT.. and then toggle to JOIN the old directory you set for JOIN
will appear. You can of course turn that off if you'd like.
 

============================= >>MAIN<< ===================================

                          _  _   ___     _  
                         | \/ | |___| | | \ |
                         |    | |   | | |  \|
 

The Main Vortex Window:
-----------------------

- The List:
-----------  
This is the large blank area within the window, and this is where a
list of selected files or dropped files will appear. Clicking twice
on the name of any file in the list will delete the entry.
 
- OPS button:
-------------
Takes you to the options screen that is relevant to the
mode you are in (split, join, encode, decode, or Action). This is
where you set the options for the actions that will be
performed.

- DRP button:
-------------
Takes you to the "DROPtions" screen for the
relevant mode you are in. The screen allows you to configure such
things as how Vortex scans disks and directories, and if Vortex
wait for user input before performing an action. The DROPtions
screen is the same for each mode... but you can have (use or save)
a different set of DROPtions for EACH mode.
 
- DOS button:
-------------
This opens the Instant Action Window. Here you'll find various
actions that you may find useful. They all occur instantly when
you press the desired action button. For a more in-depth description,
see "INSTANT ACTIONS".

- LOG button:
-------------
This brings up a window that allows you to load or save a log file.
A log file is simply what is in the "List" window. It may be useful
to use logs if you are performing the same actions over and over..
or when rebuilding/joining files.
 
- ? button:
-----------
The required ABOUT window :)

- CLR button:
-------------
This clears the contents of the List.
 
- QV button:
------------
This is "QuickView" mode. It takes all the files in the List and
shows only the filename without the path. This mode is useful if
you are displaying files that have a long path... and you need to
quickly scan through the files. The button toggles between
Standard View (whole path) and QuickView (filename only).
 
- ^? button:
------------
You don't want to drop an icon on the window to list a file? This
button brings up the file selection requester. In the requester you
simply DOUBLE-CLICK on any file you want entered into the Vortex List,
or use the ALL button on the requester to list all the files.

- ?> button:
------------
You'll see this one on many of the Vortex sub-windows. This calls
up a file requester. In this case its purpose is to set a destination
directory. This is where the "end-result"... the "destination files"
will be sent. Each mode can have its own destination directory.

The selected destination directory appears in the destination field.
 
- DESTINATION FIELD:
--------------------

This is where your DESTINATION PATH appears.
 
[<] button: (DEST FIELD MEMORY option)
------------------------------------
You'll notice that to the end of the Destination field there is
a small button with the text "<". This toggles the field
memory. Normally (when this button is NOT selected) Vortex
will remember a specific Destination for each module. This means
that if you set the SPLIT destination to "ram:" and then went
to the JOIN module and set it to something else... and then
CAME BACK to SPLIT... the destination of "ram:" would pop
up again. 

Selecting this button will allow you to move from module to module
without using the memory for the field... it will allow you
to take whatever your current setting is with you as you scan
through the modules.

NOTE: If you had earlier set the field to something and memory
was on.. when you deselect the memory button the field will return
to the last remembered setting.
 
- GO! button:
-------------
Tells Vortex to start executing the actions you have set-up for the
mode you are in.
 
- TEMP WINDOW:
--------------
Some actions (such a "pre-archiving" in the encoder modules) will
use a temporary directory to hold the archive. This is normally
set to "t:".. if you'd like to change it.. hit the "F1" key on the
keyboard and you'll get the TEMP window... set it, use it, save it,
or abort it :)

Accessed through the [DRP] button on the main panel:
 
This is where you set the options that tell Vortex how to scan a
DISK or DIRECTORY for files, if vortex should wait for user input
before taking action.. and much more. 
 
The DISK functions effect what happens when a DISK is dropped on
the Vortex window. The DIR options effect what happens when a DRAWER
is dropped on the Vortex window.
 
DISK-FILESCAN:
--------------
This toggles between two modes. ROOT and RECURSIVE.

ROOT:
-----
This will only scan the ROOT directory of a disk.
Vortex will not look into sub-directories.

RECURSIVE: 
----------
Vortex will search the ROOT directory of a disk and
it will also scan everything within all the sub-directories located
on the disk. NOTE: large hard disk partitions with lots of
sub-directories may take a quite a while to scan. 
 
DISK-FILELIST:
--------------
This toggles between two modes. ALL and SELECTIVE.

ALL:
----
ALL files found in the scanned area of the disk will be listed.
If your filescan was set to ROOT.. all files in the ROOT directory
will be listed. If your filescan was set to RECURSIVE.. all the files
found on the disk would be listed.
 
SELECTIVE:
----------
This allows you to select which type of file(s) to look for.. or
NOT look for. When this mode is selected it expects input in at
least one the two available fields: MATCHING and EXCLUDING.
 
MATCHING: [         ]
---------------------
This only works if your DISK-FILELIST is set to SELECTIVE and
the MATCHING item is turned on (a check mark). You can choose
to list/find only items matching your input in the field. This
can be an extension... a filename.. etc.

To find only files ending in ".txt" you would enter ".txt" in the
field (do not put the quotes). You can choose to match as many types
of files as you want all at once.... just be sure you separate the
text to match with a single space.

Example: To list/find all the files ending with ".pic" ".txt" ".jpg"
and files with the name "SPACE" we would enter this into the field:
".txt .pic .jpg SPACE" (Again.. do not type the quotations). As
you can see.. this allows you to match LOTS of files at once.

EXCLUDING: [         ]
----------------------
This only works if your DISK-FILELIST is set to SELECTIVE and the
EXCLUDING item is turned on (a checkmark). It allows you to EXCLUDE
any type of file that matches your given text. It works the same
way as MATCHING.. you can set this to as many types as you like
".info .doc .iff .lha HELLO" would exclude any file matching the
given text. NOTE: EXCLUDE always has priority over MATCHING.. so if
you have have ".txt" set in MATCHING and ".txt" set in excluding...
".txt" files will be EXCLUDED.
 
DIR-FILESCAN:
DIR-FILELIST
MATCHING [     ]
EXCLUDING [      ]

These options work EXACTLY as the above DISK options.. only they
effect how Vortex scans a DRAWER (or DRAWERS) when dropped on the
window.
 
MATCH and EXCLUDE "SEARCH options":
===================================

There are three options available when scanning for a MATCH or
an EXCLUDE. And these three options are available for both
DISK and DIR scanning (you can keep a separate set of options
for each).
 
Bring up the options window by clicking the DISK-FILELIST
text or DIR-FILELIST text... (next to the "selective/all") Rollover
button. (I ran out of room for buttons.. so I concealed it :) When
you click the text the window will appear.
 
[] FILE AND PATH
[] FILENAME ONLY
[] CASE SENSITIVE
 
FILE AND PATH:
--------------
Vortex will match or exclude using the entire path as as comparison
to your search input.
 
Example: You entered PIC in the MATCHING field: This would match
everything in the BigPIC drawer. and any other drawer or file
with the letters PIC in it. This allows you to match whole directories
full of files at the same time you are matching specific filetypes.
 
FILENAME ONLY:
--------------
Only the contents of the FILENAME is compared to your search
input.

CASE SENSITIVE:
---------------
Any match or exclude must be of the same "case". For instance,
if you input ".lha" this would not match files that contain
".LHA". "PIC" would not match "pic".. etc. Every match must be
of the same CASE.
 
NOTE: For the casual user.. you'll probably never need to use
these settings. A setting of "FILENAME ONLY" will do the trick.
But if you're a power hungry match/exclude maniac.. you can
use these :)
 
ANOTHER NOTE: The search options are not always 100% correct.
Filenames and paths with spaces or strange characters MAY
interfere with the matching/excluding process. Vortex will
see these as word delimiters... and not make a match/exclude.
I'm working on fixing this problem and making it 100%.
 
HELPER WINDOW:
==============
A special "helper window" is available for all of the matching
and excluding fields. Just click on the word "MATCHING:" or
"EXCLUDING:" and the window will appear. This window uses a
document (must be in the same dir as Vortex) called "VEXT.txt".

VEXT.txt is a plain ASCII document that can contain text that
you match or exclude most often.. so you can save time typing
the information in the fields. The document can be edited
and saved directly from the helper window... or using your
favorite ASCII editor. An example document is included.
 
CLEAR:
======
To clear any field... simply click the [<|] button.
 

WAIT FOR USER INPUT and AUTO GO!
================================

WAIT FOR USER INPUT:
--------------------
When you select to WAIT for input.. after you drop files on the
window NOTHING will happen until you press GO!

AUTO-GO!:
---------
When it is set to AUTO-GO! Whatever mode you are in will
AUTOMATICALLY start when something is dropped on the
Vortex... it's like pressing the go button right after
dropping a file.
 
ADD/APPEND TO LIST ON DROP and MAKE NEW LIST ON DROP
====================================================
 
ADD/APPEND:
-----------
Anything you drop in the vortex will be ADDED onto the list
of items you have already dropped.
 
MAKE NEW LIST ON DROP:
----------------------
The items that are already in the list are cleared.. and the
newly dropped items are placed in the list.

LIST .info OF DROPPED ICONS and  DON'T LIST .info of ICONS
==========================================================
 
LIST .info:
-----------
When you drop a DRAWER or a FILE... Vortex will see if there is
an .info file available and include it in the list.

DON'T LIST:
-----------
Vortex will only list the DROPPED file name..  no info file.
 

 ============================= >>SPLIT<< ==================================

                       ___  ___          _____
                      |___ |___) |     |   |
                       ___||     |___  |   |


These are the options for file splitting when using the "split"
module. They include:
 
Number of Splits:
-----------------
This Allows you to select the number of small "split-files"
generated. Selecting 10 would slice a large file in the
main window into 10 smaller files.
 
Bytes per split:
----------------
This allows you to select the number of bytes per split file.
For instance.. if you had a large file with a size of 10000
and selected a bytes per split of 1000.. you would you would
generate 10 split files at 1000 bytes each.

Number of Bytes:
----------------
This option allows you to select a set number of bytes
to split off from the main file. Using the "Starting offset"
option you can select where in the file you wish to start
splitting. The "save-rest" option allows you to save any
un-used or left-over bytes to a specified file.

Example:

You're splitting a file named "BIGFILE" that is 20000 bytes large
to the destination you set on the Vortex screen.. let's say it's
"DH1:".

Number of Bytes: 5000
Starting offset: 10000
Save Rest: ram:

(each option must be turned on for it to function... a checkmark shows
that the option is on).
 
The above would take 5000 bytes starting at the 10000 byte count
and save it to "DH1:BIGFILE_BYT" and then save the rest (ending
5000) bytes to "ram:BIGFILE_RST".
 
Floppy:
-------
This option allows you to split a large file into several
pieces directly onto floppy disk. The Flog option will
create a LOG file (with a .FLOG extension) in RAM: which will
contain a list of WHERE the split files went to. It may be useful
to include the log with the split files if you distribute them to
someone.. especially if they have Vortex. They can simply load
the FLOG and rejoin the files. The rename option allows
you to auto rename each disk to the "filename"||"SPLIT-NUMBER".
 
ASCII max lines:
----------------
When using any of the other split options on an ASCII file..
the splits don't care if they occur in the middle of a line
or word.. etc. They are BINARY splitters. These options allow you
to make splits by ASCII LINES or by ASCII BYTES.. and the program
will make sure NEVER to split a LINE or WORD in half. This is useful
if you want to send split text with no slashed words in it.

There is also a "1st Line" option... that allows you to
set the first line of the... and it will automatically be followed
by a blank line. This is very handy for those who use BBS systems
that require an Inet e-mail address (TO: joe.shmoe@nowhere.net)
as the first line and a blank line directly after. Now you can split
large documents and automatically address them.. all at once.
 
NOTES: The ASCII MAX-Bytes function will try to get as close
to the desired maximum amount as possible. It may slightly
overstep the bounds. This happens because we are making
sure not to split any lines.
 
Also, both of the ASCII split options are fairly slow (actually
VERY slow) on large ASCII files. If you are interested in splitting
encoded ascii files you should use the options in the encode module..
you will see much faster execution. If you have a really fast
machine.. it may not be too noticeable, but they ARE slow. I'll
look into speeding these options up in a future release.
 

 ============================= >>JOIN<< ===================================

                            ___ ___
                             | |   | | |\  |
                          |__| |___| | | \_|


JOIN ALL TO ONE [         ]:
---------------------------------
 
This will join ALL files to the DESTINATION you set on the Vortex window
as the FILENAME you enter into the available field on the JOIN
window. "DESTINATION_FIELD/JOIN_filename".


REBUILD SPLITS TO DEST:
----------------------

This will rebuild (take all the small sections of a split file and put
them back together) ANY file that Vortex finds that ends with any of the following extensions: .1 .01 .001 _1 _01 _001 and the file must have more than one slice (there must be a .02 .002, etc.). The other sections must
be in the same directory as the #1 extension. The files will all be
rebuilt to the destination given in the Vortex destination field.

REBUILD SPLITS TO OWN:
----------------------

This does the same as the above.. only each split file is rebuilt to its own (current) directory (where the pieces were found).
 

 ============================ >>UUencode<< =============================

                          ___        ___  ___   ___   ___
             |   | |   | |___ |\  | |    |   | |   \ |___ 
             |___| |___| |___ | \_| |___ |___| |___/ |___


There are 2 "main" modes of operation:
 
- Encode to ONE
- Encode to EACH
 
Encode to ONE: [        ]
-------------------------
This takes EACH file and encodes it into ONE file which will
be located in your set destination on the Vortex window. The
ONE encoded file will be named the "basename" you have entered
in the available field and a ".uue" extension will be added.
Remember: You don't need to put the ".uue" extension on your
basename, Vortex will do that for you.

Encode to EACH:
---------------
This takes EACH file and encodes it as a single file. This
means that a file named "hello.pic" will become "hello.pic.uue".
Each file will generate its own encoded counterpart located
in your set destination on the Vortex window.
 
There are several options available to be used with the above
modes:
 
Pre-Arc ALL: [       ]
----------------------
This will only work with the Encode to ONE mode (doesn't
make sense to use it on another mode). ALL files will
be archived to ONE "temporary" file located in your given
"TEMP:" directory. The file will be named the basename
given in the available field and an ".lha", ".lzx" or ".zip"
extension will be added (depending on which archiver you have
selected to use). REMEMBER: You don't need to add the extension
to your basename.. Vortex will do that for you. After the
temporary file is created.. it is encoded into ONE file
in your destination path given in the Vortex window. It
will be named the basename given in the Encode ALL field
and a ".uue" extension will be added. The temporary
archive file will be deleted.
 
Pre-Arc EACH:
-------------
This works with Both modes. It takes EACH file and creates
a single archive file in your given "TEMP:" directory. If
you were using the Lha archiver... A file named "Hello.pic" would
generate an archive named "Hello.pic.lha". Depending on
which "MAIN" mode you have selected (Encode to ONE or Encode
to EACH) the following will happen:
 
Encode to Each will take each archived file and generate an
encoded file in your set destination on the Vortex window.
The temporary archive files are deleted. The encoded files
will take there name from the original files basename and
a .uue extension will be added. A file named "hello.pic" would
be archived (using lha) to "hello.pic.lha" and then the encoded
file "hello.pic.uue" would be generated.
 
Encode to ONE will take each archived file and generate
ONE encoded file in your set destination on the Vortex
window. The file will be named using the basename given
in the Encode to ONE field. A .uue extension will be added.

With .info:
-----------
If this option is set and the file we are archiving has an .info
file.. it will be included in the archive.

MAX-Bytes:
----------
Split the encoded file by a maximum number of bytes (entry is
in "k").... 10 = 10000 bytes, 20 = 20000 byte, etc. Use the
[<][>] gadgets to set this if you want.. clicking once moves
forward one byte.. holding the gadgets down increases rapidly.

MAX-Lines:
----------------
Same as the above.. but we this will split the file into
a specified number of lines.

Pad: (UUXT only)
----------------
This is a feature of UUXT... it will PAD spaces in the encoded
file if you are having problems with the files in transit (see
UUXT docs).

Buff: (UUin only)
-----------------
A feature of UUin... allows you to set your encoder buffer. Default
is 32k... (a zero means to use a buffer the size of the input file).
See UUin docs for more info.

RNM: (UUin only)
----------------
A feature of UUin. UUin normally gives a single digit extension
to split files (.1, .2, .3, etc.) and then RENAMES them as
needed to .01, .001, etc. If you have a device that has problems
with that (see the UUin docs).. then this will turn off the
renaming.

1st line:
--------
This allows you to add a first line to your encoded file (or
each split file). Use the [<?] gadget to bring up the first
line window.. which uses the "line.txt" document in your
origin directory. It's a standard ascii file. The
first line will have a blank line following it. This is
useful to those who use a BBS that requires an Inet address
on the first line.

# of # cut here:
----------------
Two ways that this can work:

UUXT uses a program called UUsplit to split encoded files. The
program automatically adds the "cut here" info. When this item
is deselected... Vortex will REMOVE that information from each
split file (it will also remove any occurrence of the word UUXT
which is placed at the beginning and end of each file for
no good reason. Having this feature OFF when using UUXT (Also
when UUin is used with the Encode to One and a split option
is on) will slow down the splitting... (because vortex must
remove the text from each file). Having it on just leaves
that info in the file.

UUin does not add this information.... so Vortex will do
it for you if the item is selected.

ARC:
----
Select your archiver (lha, zip, lzx). Must be in your path.

ENC:
----
Select your encoder (UUXT, UUin) Must be in your path.

Your Temporary path should be set to anywhere that you have plenty
of space. "T:" is always a good option if you have lots of ram.
F1 from the main screen shows your TEMP path.

============================= >>UUdecode<< ==============================

                         ___   ____  ___  ___   ___   ____
            |   | |   | |   \ |____ |    |   | |   \ |____
            |___| |___| |___/ |____ |___ |___| |___/ |____


Not many options... but lots of power:
 
UNARC:
------
After Your files are DECODED to your set destination the decoded
files will be scanned to see if there are any archived files
(.lha, .lzx, .zip). Any files that were ALREADY in your destination
will be ignored. If archives are found... they will be UNARCHIVED
to your destination.
 
DELETE ARC:
-----------
If this option is selected.. and UNARC is executed (an archive
is found and extracted).. the archive file itself will be deleted
after the extract.
 
ACTION ALL DECODED FILES:
-------------------------
After the files have been decoded... they will be sent to
your action module. IF you have some actions set for various
file types and those types are found in the decoded files..
they will be ACTIONED.

MATCHING:
---------
Only decoded files matching your given text will be sent to the
action module.
 
Example:
 
You have an encoded file called "Pictures.uue". It contains
an archive of 6 .jpg pictures. You have a .jpg action set up
in your action module (a viewer). You have UNARC, DELETE ARC,
and MATCHING ".jpg" selected in the decode screen:
 
When you drop the encode file on the vortex screen (or a disk
or DIR containing the file) it will be decoded... unarced (the
arc will be deleted).. and then each picture will be sent
to your action module and shown.
 
Pretty handy eh?

CONTENTS:
---------
This nifty option will scan through all .uue files (even splits)
and list there contents. If the SIZE option is also selected each
internal file's size will also be listed.

NOTE: The SIZE option may not work on ALL uuencoded files.. 
(especially those that don't HAVE a size listing in them :)
If you get strange characters or an incorrect listing with
the SIZE option ON... turn it off and see if that helps.
 

Decoder:
--------
Select between UUXT or UUout as your decoder.

BUFFER:
-------
Only works with UUout.. allows you to set your buffer size.
 
FILES ONLY:
-----------
Only works with UUout.. tells UUout to ignore the PATHS in the
encoded files and not to create the path during the decode.


========================= >>INSTANT_ACTIONS<< ===========================

Click on the [DOS] button to bring these up. These are different
from all the other OPTIONS. These are INSTANT actions... NOT
options. This window allows you to instantly USE these commands
on whatever is listed in the Vortex window. I hope to add complete
option "modules" for many of these commands in the future... until
then I decide to toss this window in as a bonus. 
 
NOTE: most of these COMMANDS have a "matching" field to the
right of the command. This allows you to specify to perform the action
only on a file in the list MATCHING your search criteria. 

The HELPER window is available by using the [?] button. The helper
window can hold commonly used search/match extensions.. etc. and
saves you from typing. The window uses a plain ASCII document that
must reside in the same directory as Vortex.. and it must be named
"VEXT.txt". It can be edited using any ascii editor or even within
the helper window itself.
 
COPY:
-----
This will COPY all the files in the list to your destination.. or
only files in the list MATCHING what you enter in the "matching field"
to the right (which must be turned on.. "CHECK MARK").

DELETE:
-------
This will DELETE all the files in the list to your destination.. or
only files in the list MATCHING what you enter in the "matching field"
to the right (which must be turned on.. "CHECK MARK").

MOVE:
-----
This will copy all the files in the list to your destination.. or
only files in the list MATCHING what you enter in the "matching field"
to the right (which must be turned on.. "CHECK MARK").. and then
delete the original file.
 
LHAeach:
--------
This will LHA archive EACH file in the list to your destination.. or
only files in the list MATCHING what you enter in the "matching field"
to the right (which must be turned on.. "CHECK MARK"). Each file
will result in a separate archive with the files' basename and
a .lha extension.

ZIPeach:
--------
Same as the above... but with ZIP compression.

LHAone:
-------

This will LHA archive all the files in the list or only files in the
list MATCHING what you enter in the "matching field" to the FAR right (which must be turned on.. "CHECK MARK")... to ONE file in your
set destination. The destination archive will take it's name
from the given BASENAME in the field to the right of the button.
DO NOT PLACE and .lha EXTENSION on the name. Vortex will do that
for you.

ZIPone:
-------
same as the above.. but with ZIP compression.
 
LHA EXRACT , ZIP EXTRACT, LZX EXTRACT:
--------------------------------------
Looks for .lha, .zip, or .lzx files and extracts them to your
set destination.
 
AddLine:
--------
Adds the line set in the available field to the TOP of every ASCII
file found in the list. The line is followed by one blank line.
Usefull for addressing multiple text files with Internet addresses
(for those who use a BBS that requires the address on the first line
followed by a blank space).
 

============================== >>ACTION<< ===============================
  
                     ___   ___ _____    ___    
                    |___| |      |   | |   | |\  |
                    |   | |___   |   | |___| | \_|
 

The ACTION MODULE:
------------------
 
This is an interesting place. You can do all sorts of things.
You can create actions that you can turn on and off with a mouse
click. The actions can be DOS commands.. or a VORTEX command
or combinations of both.
 
Looking at the main \\//ortex //\\action ||=ditor window, you'll
see a large "list" area and below are several fields (labeled
"DOS:", and one is labeled "Vortex:". This is where you tell
Vortex WHAT to do with a file MATCHING your search criteria (the
EXT: field).
 
Before explaining the details of this screen... I'll tell you exactly
WHAT happens with the data that you enter:
 
Think of the large section at the top of the screen as an ACTION
list. You'll be entering data in the below fields that will construct the list. The list tells vortex to "DO THIS" when you "FIND
THAT". This means that Vortex will look for files matching an extension
you have given or matching the text within the file name itself... and
if it is found, Vortex will take an action.

Vortex will proceed from the top of the list to the bottom. Each
entry in the list can have 3 full actions (1 Vortex action and 2
DOS actions). The actions can be moved, copied, and turned ON or OFF.
When off, vortex will NOT perform an action on files matching the text
you have entered in the "EXT:" field.
 
EXAMPLE of what this allows you to do:
 
You could set up an action for the program "superview" to show all
files containing the extension .pic. Now, you could simply drop
a disk or directory into the vortex and show every .pic file like
a slide show.
 
The power can be much greater than that. You could set up multiple
actions for the same filetype to occur in a set order. This allows
you to perform complex tasks all at once.

Now let's take a look at WHERE and HOW you enter the info that tells
Vortex what to do:
 
Think of the DOS fields as a CLI or SHELL. Anything you can do from
the CLI or SHELL can be put in these fields. The only difference
is that these fields can use 4 additional commands:

FILE, BASENAME, BASEX, and DEST.
 
FILE = The full path/file that we are working on.
BASENAME = The filename only (without the path)
BASEX = The filename only... without an extension if it had one.
DEST = The destination we have set in the Vortex destination field.
 
EXAMPLE:

We set the EXT field to .txt and dropped the file Dh1:hello.txt
on the vortex. Vortex would then interpret the commands like this:

FILE = DH1:Hello.txt
BASENAME = Hello.txt
BASEX = Hello
DEST = (whatever you have set in your Vortex Destination Field)
 
These commands must always be used in UPPERCASE.
 
If you are familiar with using a CLI or Shell.. even for the
most simple tasks, you will find the Vortex DOS fields very
simple to use. In fact, the V.A.E. commands will make things
VERY EASY for you.
 
- The "EXT:" field

  This is where you place the EXTENSIONS you wish to match (the
  types of files you want an action to happen to). You can put
  as many as you like.. the only limit is a 256 character maximum
  in the field. Each extension MUST be separated by a space.
  You can ALSO match portions of a FILENAME.. so you are not
  simply limited to an EXTENSION match.

  EXAMPLE: .txt .pic .doc SPACE HELLO

  The "case" (capital or lowercase) does not matter. Any extension
  matching each WORD above will trigger your action.
 
This would match all files with a .txt .pic or .doc extension...
and any files with the words SPACE or HELLO in them.
 
- "DOS:" fields
 
  The TOP DOS: field is DOS #1. It goes first.. before DOS #2 :)
  When a file is found that matches one of the given extensions
  this field is executed. Just think of this as a CLI or SHELL.
  With a little more control... as you'll soon see.
 
  Each DOS field can understand the 4 mentioned commands. DEST,
  FILE, BASENAME, and BASEX. They MUST be in CAPITAL letters.
  
  Each DOS field can be executed on a PER FILE basis or ONCE
  (only when a matching file is found for the first time). When
  a DOS field is set to ONCE... it will not understand the V.A.C.
  FILE commands (since we are only executing ONCE when ANY matching
  file is found.. we are not concerned with WHICH file was found).
  
  Preceding each DOS field is the STACK field. If a cli program
  you are executing needs a specific stack size, you can set it
  here. The stack size is automatically set to 4096 for each
  program unless you enter and USE/SAVE another amount. Most
  programs probably won't care much about the stack... but
  if they do.. here's where you set it :)
 
Let's say you dropped a disk on the Vortex set to ACTION mode
with a destination of "ram disk/t:". The disk "Droptions" (DRP)
were set to "ROOT"/"ALL".. so everything in the root directory
will be scanned.

Now, Vortex checks the FIRST entry in your ACTION list... (if
there is one). Let's say you have only ONE entry for the extension
".pic". Vortex will then scan all the files we found in the root
directory of the dropped disk for any ".pic" extensions. If we
found any we will execute the given DOS commands (if any). If
the DOS command is a PER-FILE command (ONCE is not selected)
the DOS commands will be executed for EACH matching file. If
the DOS command is a ONCE command (ONCE is selected).. the DOS
command will execute only ONCE if ANY matching files are found.
here are some examples....
 
A command to simply show the picture using an external utility
such as "superview" could be achieved with the command:
 
superview FILE
 
That's it. Everything matching the given extension (or extensions)
would be sent to superview.
 
To copy all the matching files to the set destination...
 
copy FILE DEST
 
To Archive each file into it's own archive (an archive with the
files basename) to your set destination....
 
lha a DESTBASENAME.lha FILE
 
If we wanted to archive each file into ONE archive with the name
TEST.lha....
 
lha a DESTtest.lha FILE

Getting the idea?
 
Here's an example of how a ONCE action works:
 
EXT: .pic

DOS: lha a "DESTtest.lha" "FILE"
DOS: UUin "DESTtest.lha" "DESTtest.uue" (ONCE)

The above example would archive EACH .pic file into DEST/test.lha
(DEST is whatever you set in the vortex destination field). Then
after performing lha on EACH file.. it will activate UUin ONCE
and encode the lha file created in DEST.. creating DEST/test.uue.
 
If we did not set the ONCE option for UUIN on the DOS2 field..
UUIN would have been executed on/for EACH file we found. The
ONCE option tells Vortex to perform the action ONCE when the
filetype (or whatever you typed into the EXT field) is found.
Not on a per file basis. Remember... BASENAME, BASEX and FILE do
not work with the ONCE option since it is not concerned with a
single file.

Just remember:
  
FILE: interpreted as the file we have found (a file matching the EXT
and dropped on the Vortex as a file.. within a disk or a drawer). The
WHOLE PATH and FILENAME.

BASENAME: interpreted always inerpreted the basename of that file.

BASEX: interpreted as the basename with the extension removed (if it
had one).

DEST: interpreted as your set destination in the Vortex
destination field for the ACTION module.

Once you get comfortable using the V.A.C. commands within
your regular DOS commands... you'll see that you can perform
anything that you could do from a CLI or SHELL -but- you can
manipulate the data coming in from Vortex WITHIN the dos
command line.

IMPORTANT:
 
Notice how we type the V.A.C. commands. DESTBASENAME (both commands
placed TOGETHER... this is because we are saying "ram:t/basename"..
etc. When you are combining DEST with a filename.. they must
be connected.. because they are a PATH and a FILENAME.
 
DESTBASENAME
DESTBASEX
t:BASENAME
t:BASEX
DESTtest.file

Get it?


MORE POWER!
 
I made TWO DOS actions available PER "EXT" entry... but you can
extend actions out over several entries if you wish. For instance
you can perform 10 actions on files matching ".pic".. by making 5
entries (2 commands each). You could view the pictures, pack them,
encode them, split them, and anything else you could do
from the CLI.. but here it will always be done
automatically and in the order it appears in your Action Editor
List). You can turn off entries, delete entries, copy them, etc..
this allows you to make changes easily and quickly to your
configuration. You could set up all of the above actions.. and then
decide you don't need the "splitting".. so you just turn that entry
off... bingo. When you need it again, just turn it on. You need
it to happen BEFORE another command... just move it or copy it to
where you need it.

More examples:
 
Let's say we want to Archive all the .txt files dropped on the
Vortex window to ONE file in the vortex destination.
 
lha a DESTtestfile.lha FILE
 
This would create a file in the set destination called "testfile.lha"
and it would contain all the dropped .txt files.
 
Let's say we want to Archive all the .txt files dropped on the
Vortex window as a single archive each.. to the set destination
taking each name from the filename (leaving the .txt extension).
 
lha a DESTBASENAME.lha FILE

This would create an archive of each .txt file using the basename
and adding an .lha extension onto it. If you dropped a file called
test.txt you would create test.txt.lha.

Let's say you wanted the same as the above but without the .txt
extension.

lha a DESTBASEX.lha FILE
 
This would create the same as the above without the .txt extension
included in the resulting file. test.lha.
 
----

The VORTEX option:
==================

The Vortex option (if selected) is performed before DOS1 and DOS2.
All matching files will be sent to the Vortex module you have selected.
The setting in that module will be used on each file.
 
At the moment the the "FLOPPY" option in the split module does not
work correctly with the Vortex option in the Action Editor.. all
other vortex module options work properly.
 
Using the Vortex option WITH the DOS options can be very powerful.
You can Send all ".pic" files to Vortex split.. and then perform
a few DOS actions on them with your DOS fields.
 
The Controls:
=============
 
ADD:
----
Adds whatever you have typed into the field to the ACTION list
as a new entry at the end of the list.

INSERT:
-------
Adds whatever you have typed into the fields to the ACTION list
and inserts it before the current listing.

^^:
---
UPdates the listing you are working on. If you made changes..
hit this and they will go into the list.

QIK:
----
When this button is ON (pushed in) the changes you make will
automatically go into the ACTION list when you hit return
from within a field or turn a button on.. etc. It's like
having the ^^ button on all the time.

Copy:
-----
Click on an item from the list, select the copy button and
you can copy that item to wherever you next click in the list.
The item will be added BEFORE the entry you click on.

Move:
-----
Same as the above.. but deletes the old entry after copying
it.

Delete:
-------
Click on an entry in the list and then hit this button to
delete it.

|<<
----
Go the the first entry

>>]
----
Go to the last entry

> = NEXT entry.

< = Prev entry.

FIELDS:
-------
The two fields show you the item number you are working on in the
list, and the total number of action items in the list.

NOTES:

* You can select any item in the list by clicking on it.

* You can turn an item on or off by double clicking on it.

* If you have entered an item in the dos field that may be
  using a path with spaces in it or a file name with spaces in
  it.. use quotes.. just like you would from the CLI. Example:

  Superview "FILE"
 

You can create some fairly powerful scripts in the action editor.
Just get used to the commands and how they work.. and you'll
be on your way! If all you need is simple "If -THIS- then -THAT-
actions... all you do is enter an EXT, and create a DOS or VORTEX
entry of what you want to happen (per file or once).

EXT: .pic

DOS: SuperView FILE

-------

EXT: .lha .lzh .lz

DOS: lha x FILE DEST

-------

Whew! I'm almost done typing! FINALLY!
 
CONFIGUARTION:
--------------

Throughout Vortex you'll see the buttons USE SAVE and ABORT.
If you select to SAVE any of your settings.. Vortex will create
a file called Vortex.cfg in the directory in which Vortex
resides. From now on it will use those settings when the
program is started.

Vortex is not distributed with a Vortex.cfg file... because
it will automatically switch to default settings when such a
file is not found. The file is only needed if you are saving
your own settings.

The Line.txt document is an ascii file that contain lines that
you want to use with the first line gadget.

The VEXT.txt document is an ascii file that can contain extensions
or other words that you match on a regular basis.

You can save a different set of DROPtions for each mode.

A GENERAL Encoding/Decoding TIP and a word about compatibility:
===============================================================

Before sending someone an encoded file.. try decoding it yourself.
make sure it turned out o.k. on your end first. Sometimes an
encoder (uuin/uuxt) will make an error durring the decode...
and if you try it again.. it will work correctly. Why? You got me.
 
When an encoded file gets picked up from a newsgroup or has
been mixed in with other files or text... it can have all kinds of
extra garbage in it not belonging to the encoded file. Sometimes
this makes it hard for the decoder to work properly... that's the
decoders problem.. not VORTEX's.

Sometimes UUout will decode a file that UUxt won't and sometimes
UUXT will decode a file that UUout won't. If you aren't successful
with one.. try the other.
 
Also.. wherever possible (archivers or encoders/decoders) you
should make them resident (if they can be made resident).. this
will speed up all actions. (when an archiver is adding a file
at a time to a large archive.. etc). If I can't get the "chunk"
method working (see "things to do" below) I may just auto-resident
and then auto-remove each program as needed.. allowing for a
speed up.

In the Words of Han Solo.... "It's not my fault!"
 
----------------------
THINGS I'D LIKE TO DO:
----------------------

Arexx port? I don't know if I can find the time.. but we'll see.
 
Add a module specific to Archivers.

Add modules specific to other programs (MIME encoders/decoders, etc.)
 
Add support for more archivers: The ones I'm working on now are:
GZIP and GNUtar. (.gz .tar). Let me know if you need one.

Add some "smart" code to check how many file you are working
on... and see if we are allowed to put them in a row THROUGH the
archiver/encoder we are using. This will cause a great speed increase
(see how fast LHA is when adding files to one?.. that's because it's
using a "list" as input... and a list can have LOTS of files.
Some programs do not except input from a list.. and there is
a restriction on how many files we can send to them AT ONCE
on a command line. So right now.. those files are sent one
at a time.. so we don't have an overflow problem. That means
that the program being executed must "reload" itself each time
.. which slows things down some). I'll get around this in the
next release by sending files in CHUNKS. and you'll see a speed
increase in Archivers and Encoders!
 
Add "Case Sensitive", "PATH and FILE", and "FILEONLY" options
to -ALL- searches in Vortex (the action window does not have this
at the moment.. it searches for a match on a PER LINE basis (PATH
and/or FILENAME).
 
More Custom COMMANDS for the DOS fields?
 
Add user-function keys and keyboard shortcuts.
 
Add the ability to ACTION single files in the list by selecting
them and pressing a key.
 
Have the program "adjust" to a high-res interlace screen. If
you use such a screen you'll probably notice that the windows
all seem squished.. that's because Vortex was designed on
a low-res screen and cannot auto-resize itself. This is going
to be lots of work... so I won't do it unless I see there
are people who want it. It doesn't really look TOO bad on
a high-res interlace screen, just squashed :)
 
Fix the floppy split option to work within the Action Module.

Add some way of STOPPING an action after it has started.. in
case you didn't mean to do it.
 
More error detection stuff... right now we are getting by on
the minimum. If the program simply shutsdown.. that means
you hit an error without error code to take care of it. I'll
need to know what you were doing when it happened to fix
it. I -HOPE- I already got all of the areas that could cause
this.
 
After I clean-up the code.. and add a bunch of notes to it..
I'll release it. Watch for a nice archive full of SOURCE CODE
to appear soon.
 
Welp, that's it... now I think I can rest my eye's and stop
thinking in CODE :)
 
   // 
\\//AMIGA FOREVER!
