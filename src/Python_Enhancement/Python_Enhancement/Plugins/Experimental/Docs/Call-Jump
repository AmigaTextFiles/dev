                        Calling A Machine Code Routine.
                        -------------------------------

THIS COMMAND IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS!!!

DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!

The 'Jump' command is IDENTICAL to the 'Call' command and is included
just in case there is a keyword/command conflict with the calling language
in use. Just substitute 'Jump' for 'Call' below...

EXPERIMENTAL!!!
---------------

Call:-
Call <address><RETURN/ENTER>
Where:-
'address' is a 24 bit address, in decimal format, from 0 to 16777212.
Nothing is returned to Python.

On ANY VALID address this command will transfer the 'PC', (program counter),
to a machine language routine/program of YOUR own. There MUST be some form
of 'RTS', (return), back to 'Call' from YOUR program so that you can return
back to Python safely.

The command will ONLY work on EVEN addresses inside the values above.

In the event of ANY ERROR the 'Call' will default to a softboot reset
routine AND WILL RESET the computer...

SO BE VERY, VERY CAREFUL AS ANY MISTAKES CAN BE CATASTROPHIC!!!

Any assembler code should have the 3 main lines ~*~ below:-

        Usual equates etc here...         ;Any necessary startup stuff.


        movem.l        d0-d7/a0-a6,-(sp)  ;* Save all registers just in case!
        ...                               ;
        <All of your code in here.>       ;
        ...                               ;
        movem.l        (sp)+,d0-d7/a0-a6  ;* Restore all registers.
        rts                               ;* Final line to return back to
                                          ;the Call/Jump command.
        <Subroutines here if required.>   ;


        Any constants etc here...         ;~db~, ~dc~ etc...

        end                               ;IF NEEDED for some assemblers.
