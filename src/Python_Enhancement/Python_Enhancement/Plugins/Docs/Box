                     Drawing Boxes Of Differing Types.
                     ---------------------------------

Box:-
Box <xstart> <ystart> <xfinish> <yfinish> <type><RETURN/ENTER>
Where:-
'xstart' is a value from 0 to 1280.
'xfinish' is a value from 0 to 1280.
'ystart' is a value from 0 to 1024.
'yfinish' is a value from 0 to 1024.
'type' is a value from 1 to 3.
And 'type':-
'1' is a raised '3D' box.
'2' is a recessed '3D' box.
'3' is a string-gadget type box.
Nothing is returned to Python.

IMPORTANT!
The colours drawn will be the LAST known foreground and background colours.

By choosing the correct shapes 'Buttons' can be generated to create a
PSEUDO GUI effect. With suitable usage of this command then working standard
type buttons are easily capable - see 'Buttons.py' in the 'Gadgets&Widgets'
drawer.

A WAY COOL effect is to enable a button, (Box), and highlight any text
inside that button to be reset later in your program - see the 'Data-Logger'
image grabs. The URL for the current archive is in the 'Data-Logger.TXT'
file.

'xstart' and 'ystart' is the TOP left hand of corner the box drawn and
'xfinish' and 'yfinish' is the bottom right hand corner of the box drawn,
relative to the ABSOLUTE TOP left hand corner of the Python window. YES, IT
IS possible to draw these boxes into the title bar IF YOU so desired - so
unless this is intentional, BEWARE!!!
THIS IS NOT A BUG...
