                Setting The Cursor Position For Printing.
                -----------------------------------------

Locate:-
Locate <cursorline> <cursorcolumn><RETURN/ENTER>
Where:-
'cursorline' is a value from 1 to 60.
'cursorcolumn' is a value from 1 to 160.
Nothing is returned to Python.

'cursorline' is limited to the number required for standard PAL or NTSC
formats. This can be increased in the ACE Basic source code if you so
desire and recompiled to suit. As it stands the two values cater for
PAL-SuperHires mode and lower.

With suitable manipulation of the STANDARD Python 'Escape' sequencies more
columns and lines can be catered for without having to change the ACE Basic
source code at all.

IMPORTANT NOTE:-
----------------
Because there can be ANY random font on ANY random machine, FIX the print
position AND the font using the 'Echo' AND 'SetFont' commands.
Three IMPORTANT lines are required right at the beginning of your Python
program to do this...

# The first IMPORTANT line, import(s).
import os
# (Other import(s) IF REQUIRED go here.)

# The second IMPORTANT line. This section is very, VERY IMPORTANT!!!
# It sets the plot position for ALL text operations and is used to allow
# for strange system fonts that make the title bar look odd. If set to a
# horizontal of 4 pixels and a vertical of 22 pixels then a font height
# of up to 19 pixels will be catered for in the title bar.
# 'Echo' command clears the WHOLE of the window, sets the PRINT position,
# sets the foreground and background colours and clears the window again
# to 'lock it'.
os.system('Echo "*ec *e[4x *e[22y *e[31m *e[40m *ec"')

# The third IMPORTANT line. Set an internal font, in this case to
# 'topaz font 8'. Note:- 'SetFont' also clears the window.
os.system('C:SetFont topaz SIZE 8')

def main():
	# +-------------------------+
	# | Your program in here... |
	# +-------------------------+
main()
# That's all there is to it!!!
