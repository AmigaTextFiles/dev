                         Generating A Circle/Ellipse.
                         ----------------------------

Circle:-
Circle <x> <y> <radius> <colour> <start> <finish> <aspect><RETURN/ENTER>
Where:-
'x' is a value from 0 to 1280.
'y' is a value from 0 to 1024.
'radius' is a value from 1 to 1280.
'colour' is a value from 0 to 7, (31).
'start' is a value from 0 to 359.
'finish' is a value from 0 to 359.
'aspect' is a value from 0.1 to 10.
Nothing is returned to Python.

It is VERY difficult to generate a circle remotely as there are so many
montior/TV resolutions available, so the 'aspect' argument is added with
a large variation to cater for 'ALL' contingences. If you are using this
command then state the resolution that you require to ensure a round circle
rather than an ellipse if a dedicated circle is important.

'x' and 'y' are the co-ordinates of the centre of the circle relative to
the ABSOLUTE TOP left hand corner of the Python window. YES, IT IS possible
to draw inside the title bar - so unless this is intentional, BEWARE!!!
THIS IS NOT A BUG...

'start' and 'finish' can be altered to suit your needs IF ONLY an ARC is
required any where inside the window - YOU will have to experiment with the
values if this is YOUR requirement.

'radius' and 'colour' are both obvious!!!
