                             The Mouse Command.
                             ------------------

Mouse:-
Mouse<RETURN/ENTER>

This returns an encoded combination of horizontal, vertical and left mouse
button status in the RC, (RETURN/CODE), of the executable to Python.

Horizontal values from 0 to 4095.
Vertical values from 0 to 4095.
LMB either 0 for NOT pressed or 1 for pressed.

(LMB = Left Mouse Button.)

The RC is a 32 bit value where 25 bits, (bits 0 to 24), are used
ONLY at the moment:-

Bits 0 to 11 inclusive are the vertical pointer position.
Bits 12 to 23 inclusive are the horizontal pointer position
Bit 24 is 0 for the LMB NOT pressed OR 1 for the LMB pressed.
Bits 25 to 31 are reserved.

The maximum decimal value that can be generated is 33554431 and the
minimum is 0.

The co-ordinates are raletive to the TOP left hand corner of the SCRATCHPAD
area of the Python window NOT THE ABSOLUTE TOP left hand corner, like the
various drawing commands - SO BE VERY AWARE OF THIS WHEN DOING CALCULATIONS.

YOU will have to work out the necessary offsets to align any mouse pointer
values with any graphics drawing values!!!

Using y=0 to 4095, x=0 to 4095, lmb=0 or 1 the encoded calculation is:-

                      rc=((lmb*16777216)+(4096*x)+y)

Where rc is the return code for Python.

Refer to the Python code 'Mouse.py' for the decoding calculations.
