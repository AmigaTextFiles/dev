                Genearting A Number From ANY String Supplied.
                ---------------------------------------------

Val:-
Val <somestring><RETURN/ENTER>
Where:-
'somestring' is absolutely ANY string at all.
Returns a signed long integer in the RC back to Python.

(Refer to the 'Val.py' file in the 'Odds&Sods' drawer.)

This is used to give an easy string to number transfer inside Python.

It's PRIME use is in the "somestring = raw_input('prompt')" function to
convert 'somestring' to a required NUMERICAL value for your Python code
WITHOUT ANY ERRORS being generated. It is to allow for any user 'typos'
that occur in the real world!!!

The command returns a 'signed long integer' back to Python using the RC,
(return code), to pass the value. It will ONLY do decimal whole numbers
from -2147483648 to +2147483647. Although ACE Basic WILL allow HEX, OCT
and 32 Bit Single Precision numbers also, I decided on just a simple whole
number transfer ONLY. ANYTHING can be sent as an argument to this command
and depending upon the argument the result will either be the number from
a valid numerical string, zero for ANY ASCII string, or the numbers at the
start of any random string. See the BASIC code for more information.

There are some implications to this command however...

1) If the string is INVALID and has NO numerical characters in it then the
   returned value 'signed long integer' WILL be 0, (zero). YOU MUST ensure
   that your Python code can use this number without any errors from Python.
   An example of this is a 'divide by zero' error that could occur.
2) A(n) RC of -1 WILL produce the ONLY oddity. This will return a(n) RC of
   10, instead of what you expect, SO IF the string, '-1' is what you sent
   as an argument allow for this in your code and convert the RC of 10 back
   to -1 in your Python code. IF THE STRING IS ANY VALID NUMERICAL VALUE
   THEN 'Val' DOES NOT NEED TO BE CALLED AT ALL AS Python CAN EASILY
   HANDLE GENUINE NUMERICAL STRINGS AND CONVERT THEM TO REAL NUMBERS!!!
3) IF the ASCII representation of a number you send to 'Val' is greater than
   the largest value or less than the least value then it WILL 'wrap' into
   the 32 Bits and could easily return ANY value according to the bits set
   after doing the calculations. BE WELL AWARE OF THIS AND IT IS NOT A BUG!
