  Preface:-
  ---------

        THESE LUNATIC IDEAS ARE COPYRIGHT (C)2007, B.Walker, G0LCU.

  MAJOR ASSUMPTION:-
  'PYTHON:' is the volume name assigned to the 'Drive:Drawer/' where the
  Python executable resides.

  For example:-

  Assign >NIL: PYTHON: Work:Python_1.4

  Open up a genuine AMIGADOS Shell and type:-

  AMIGA-Shell:> Python<RETURN/ENTER>
  >>> _

  AND away we go...

  Using standard syntax for Python run the DEMO scripts...

  EXAMPLE:-

  >>> execfile('PYTHON:<Path/>Coloured-Text.py')<RETURN/ENTER>

  Where <Path/> is the drawer which contains the DEMO scripts.

  These 'enhancements' will ONLY work from a genuine AMIGADOS Shell!!!

  There is a 'Python-Shell' icon and a sample Python-Startup file for
  your assistance. Just copy the icon to 'PYTHON:' and the 'Python-Startup'
  file to 'S:'...

  Copy the 'Plugins' drawer to the 'PYTHON:' volume. There should now be
  a 'PYTHON:Plugins' drawer...

  Enjoy finding simple solutions to often difficult problems... :)

  (Read the relevant files in the respective drawers for all other code in
  this archive.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  AmigaDOS Error Reports When Using The RC For Data Transfer:-
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  IMPORTANT!!!, 'command' refers to the executables in the 'Plugins/' or
  'Plugins/Experimental/' drawers for this archive ONLY.

  When a command is called via Python that requires an 8, 16 or 32 bit
  data transfer back to Python the command uses the return code, RC, to
  transfer that data. This results in an AmigaDOS error report to be
  generated. THIS IS NOT A BUG!!!

  Because this error report is printed back to the screen then ways and
  means have to be applied to remove the anomaly.

  IMPORTANT NOTE:- THIS DOES NOT APPLY WHEN RUNNING 'Python' FROM A TOOL
  ICON; THIS ONLY OCCURS WHEN RUNNING FROM A SHELL WINDOW!!!... ALL
  ERRORS ARE POINTED 'EFFECTIVELY' TO >NIL: WHEN USING THE TOOL ICON
  METHOD TO START 'Python'...

  A simple means of doing so is to ALLOW this to be printed at some
  preselected part of the Python-Shell window BUT making the foreground
  and background colours the same.

  This requires two of the commands to be used in conjunction with the
  MAIN command that is required.

  1) Color:- Use this command before the 'Locate' command.
     Ensure the foreground and background colours are the same.
  2) Locate:- Use this command before the MAIN command that generates an RC
     and place the 'error' report in an unused part of the Python window.
  3) MAIN:- This is the command that uses a(n) RC to give values back to
     Python, for example 'peek 16777215'.
  4) Color:- Use this command again to refresh the foreground and
     background colours again.
  5) Locate:- Use this command again to set the print position back to
     where it was before MAIN was called.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Simple Python Example:-
-------------------------

ErrorHide.py
------------

# Note:- It is assumed that the 'Plugins' drawer is in the 'PYTHON:' volume.

# One way of hiding any AmigaDOS errors.
# This import is ALWAYS required!!!
import os

def main():
	# Allocate a definate value for 'rc'.
	rc = 0
	# Clear the screen for this example!
	print '\f'
	# Set the foreground and background colours the same as
        # the normal background colour.
	os.system('PYTHON:Plugins/Color 0 0')
	# Now set a print position for the AmigaDOS error report.
	# In this example the print position 15 lines down at the left
        # hand side is clear and unused so set it to that...
	os.system('PYTHON:Plugins/Locate 15 1')
	# I will do a peek of a memory location for this example.
	rc = os.system('PYTHON:Plugins/peek 16777215')
	# The 'error' WILL be printed to the screen but NOT seen!!!
	# Now issue another 'Color' to reset the colours back as they were.
	os.system('PYTHON:Plugins/Color 1 0')
	# Foreground is now colour 1, background is now colour 0.
	# Reset the print position back from where it came from.
	os.system('PYTHON:Plugins/Locate 2 1')
	# Now print the result that you want.
	print 'Value at address 16777215 is',rc,'\b.   '
	print
main()
# That's all there is to it... :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Limitations:-
  -------------

  Because this/these method(s) of generating graphics and sound are TOTALLY
  NON-STANDARD I have BUILT IN limitations purely for my own reasons. As the
  source code is issued and written in what I call 'baby BASIC' then there
  is no reason why 'you' can't experiment with extending these limits.

  Any BASIC code is compiled using ACE Basic compiler.
  Any ANSI C code is compiled using VBCC or Dice-C compilers.
  Any Assembler code is compiled using a68k and linked using blink.

  All are FREE and up on AMINET for you to download... :)

  All copyrights recognised to the respective authors.

  The Limitations Are:-
  ---------------------

  1) FOR CLASSIC AMIGAS ONLY AND WINUAE/AF2005!!!
  2) Designed around Python 1.4x MINIMUM...
     NOTE:- MINIMUM, the ideas work on WinUAE/AF2005 running Python 2.0x.
  3) To be used on a STOCK A1200 MINIMUM...
     NOTE:- So long as the minimum CPU is a(n) 68EC020, any A500 with an
     accelerator card fitted will work fine but MUST ALSO have at least
     0.5MB of trapdoor SlowRam and 1MB of FastRam installed, that is at
     least 2MB of memory IN TOTAL. (A600 with 2MB ChipRam and 68EC020+. :)
  4) KickStart 3.0x and a FULL Workbench 3.0x IS required along with ALL
     standard hardware fittings.
  5) A HDD IS required, if only for convenience.
  6) OCS chipset is all that is needed for ANY graphics.
  7) Standard AMIGA 4 cahnnel stereo sound is all that is needed.
  8) The default 'Python_Enhancement' install is limited to the AMIGA
     standard 16MB boundary.
     NOTE:- ALL source code is supplied and you can alter and recompile
     the source under GPL2 terms and if your modifications work re-issue
     your experiments back to AMINET or some OTHER means of downloading
     your source code AND executables.
  9) All graphics plots are limited to a horizontal value of 1280 pixels
     and a vertical value of 1024 pixels, this should take into account
     most graphics modes.
 10) A 'SHELL' window is only capable of using the first 8 colours, that is
     palette registers 0 to 7 inclusive BUT the 'Palette' command IS capable
     of using ALL 32 OCS colour registers 0 to 31 inclusive.
 11) IF you decide on using a 'Tool' icon to start Python with then you will
     HAVE to find out which commands work and do-not work when using Python
     under these conditions; NONE of them cause system crashes but just
     don't work UNLESS they are in a 'SHELL' window. I think it is ONLY the
     'ClearScn', 'Color', 'Locate' and 'Paint' commands at the moment.
 12) The 'Mouse' command encodes horizontal position, vertical position
     and left mouse button press(ed) ONLY at the moment with a maximum
     of 0 to 4095 pixels in both directions.
 13) The 'LMB' - single click to continue - was added for easy left mouse
     button usage without the need for any special requirements.
 14) Lots of HDD 'READ ONLY' bashing will occur BUT even this is less than
     any 'Windows' TM install under NORMAL running conditions!!!
 15) System fonts of strange sizes cause odd print position 'errors' with
     relation to any graphics printed - use the system's 'SetFont' external
     command inside the C: volume to FIX the font of your choice for the
     window that 'Python' is running in. This command WILL generate a
     'clear screen' also so there is NO need to implement either a ClearScn
     command OR the Python "print '\f'," statement for this. Call the
     'SetFont' command VERY EARLY in you Python code!!!. See BELOW and in
     the archive for more information.
 16) Others that I can't remember at the moment... :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AmigaDOS 'Echo' command...
------------------------------

Echo ?
/M,NOLINE/S,FIRST/K/N,LEN/K/N,TO/K: 

Available Special Escape Codes, PLUS MANY OTHERS...

The number, "0" in the following examples, e.g. in "*e[0m" is the number
zero, not the letter O.

The hash, "#" is NOT typed as such but substituted with a number. For
example, where you see:-

  *e[#u

you substitute a number such as "40" for the "#" to give:-

  *e[40u

Apart from the "e", the letters used below ARE case sensitive.
You MUST use the case shown.

Resets        *ec     Clears window & resets all modes to defaults.
              *e[0m   Resets graphics modes to defaults.

Text Styles   *e[1m   Boldface on.
              *e[3m   Italics on.
              *e[4m   Underline on.
              *e[7m   Reverse Video on.
              *e[0m   Reset to defaults.

Text Colours  *e[30m  Text Colour 0.
              *e[31m  Text Colour 1.
              *e[32m  Text Colour 2.
              *e[33m  Text Colour 3.
              *e[3#m  Text Colour # = 4-7 inclusive if 8 colour screen.
              *e[0m   Reset to defaults.

Background    *e[40m  Background Colour 0.
              *e[41m  Background Colour 1.
              *e[42m  Background Colour 2.
              *e[43m  Background Colour 3.
              *e[4#m  Background Colour # = 4-7 inclusive if 8 colour screen.
              *e[0m   Reset to defaults.

Note - Default workbench screen colours are:-

             Colour 0  v2+ - Grey     v1.x - Blue
             Colour 1  v2+ - Black    v1.x - White
             Colour 2  v2+ - White    v1.x - Black
             Colour 3  v2+ - Blue     v1.x - Orange

Other items   *e[#u   Set maximum length of lines in window to #.
              *e[#t   Set maximum number lines in window to #.
              *e[#x   Start text # pixels from left of window.
              *e[#y   Start text # pixels from top of window.

              *eD     Move down one line but maintain current column.
              *eE     Move to start of next line down.
              *eM     Move up one line but maintain current column.

This DEMO Python script below uses the Escape Codes to change the ForGround
and BackGround colours only, but the other Codes work as well... :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python Code:-
-------------

Coloured-Text.py
----------------

# A simple method of adding 4, (to 8), basic colours to the Python Environment.
# This includes basic typefaces as well.
# The idea is copyright, (C)04-01-2007, B.Walker, G0LCU.
# It uses a standard AMIGA Shell and running Python IN that shell.
# It will only work RELIABLY this way.
# It NEEDS 'Echo' to be available in the AMIGAs PATH.
# It uses SOME of the ~Escape Codes~ available to 'Echo' to produce these
# results. In the code below are colour changes only, but any mixture
# of ForeGround, BackGround and TypeFaces can be added using this method.
# Written so that kids can understand it... :)

# This is the only import required for this DEMO.
import os

def main():
	# Ensure STANDARD ForeGround and BackGround colours.
	os.system('Echo "*e[31m *e[40m"')
	print "\f"
	print "We are going to use the AMIGA Shell to change text colours"
	print "and styles in a Python environment..."
	print
	print "This will SET Colour 2 ForeGround on Colour 0 BackGround."
	os.system('Echo "*e[32m *e[40m"')
	print "SET Colour 2 ForeGround on Colour 0 BackGround."
	os.system('Echo "*e[31m *e[40m"')
	print "This will SET Colour 3 ForeGround on Colour 2 BackGround."
	os.system('Echo "*e[33m *e[42m"')
	print "SET Colour 3 ForeGround on Colour 2 BackGround."
	os.system('Echo "*e[31m *e[40m"')
	print "\v "
	print "Now SET back to normal... :)"
	print	
main()
# Self explanatory but 'DEAD SIMPLE', Eh!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AmigaDOS 'SetFont' command...
---------------------------------

SetFont ?
NAME/A,SIZE/N/A,SCALE/S,PROP/S,ITALIC/S,BOLD/S,UNDERLINE/S:

We shall be using:-

SetFont topaz SIZE 8
SetFont topaz SIZE 16

To change the font size...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python Code:-
-------------

Font.py
-------

# Changing the font sizes using the AMIGADOS 'SetFont' command.
# This simple code is copyright, (C)04-01-2007, B.Walker, G0LCU.
# It NEEDS 'SetFont' to be in the AMIGAs 'C:' volume.
# Written so that kids can understand it... :)
# The requirements are similar to Coloured-Text.py.
# Every time 'SetFont' is called it WILL clear the screen so ALLOW
# for this inside YOUR code!!!

# Standard import.
import os

def main():
	# This is the method to change a font size.
	os.system('C:SetFont topaz SIZE 8')
	print
	print "This is the standard topaz 8 system font..."
	print
	raw_input('Press ENTER:- ')
	os.system('C:SetFont topaz SIZE 16')
	print
	print "Now topaz 16 font..."
	print
	raw_input('Press ENTER:- ')
	os.system('C:SetFont topaz SIZE 8')
	print
	print "Reset back to topaz 8 font..."
	print
main()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AmigaDOS 'RequestFile' command...
-------------------------------------

RequestFile ?
DRAWER,FILE/K,PATTERN/K,TITLE/K,POSITIVE/K,NEGATIVE/K,ACCEPTPATTERN/K,
REJECTPATTERN/K,SAVEMODE/S,MULTISELECT/S,DRAWERSONLY/S,NOICONS/S,PUBSCREEN/K:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python Code:-
-------------

RequestFile.py
--------------

# Running an executable file from anywhere using Python 1.4x.
# This idea is copyright, (C)2007, B.Walker, G0LCU.
# It needs RequestFile to be in the AMIGAs 'C:' volume.
# Written so that kids can understand it.
# The requirements are similar to Coloured-Text.py.

# Do any necessary imports.
import os

def main():
	# Only one line is needed for this demo.
	# This will _STOP_ with an error if the file is NOT executable!!!
	# IMPORTANT NOTE...
        # NOTICE THE REVERSE INVERTED COMMAS -> `???` IN THE LINE BELOW!!!
	os.system('Run >NIL: `RequestFile`')
main()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AmigaDOS 'Wait' command...
------------------------------

Wait ?
/N,SEC=SECS/S,MIN=MINS/S,UNTIL/K: 
Used to generate a timed delay in seconds.

There is an unfortunate problem with the 'import time' module which causes
a VERY serious lockup when using WinUAE/AF2005 and Python 2.0x so therefore
the 'call' time.sleep(<some seconds>) does NOT work...
However we are very lucky to have the AmigaDOS 'Wait' command... :)

This is an alternative and works, (dare I say 'perfectly' :)!!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python Code:-
-------------

Delay.py
--------

# Adding a time delay using AMIGADOS's ~Wait~ command.
# For Python Version 1.4 minimum.
# Original idea copyright, (C)2007, B.Walker, G0LCU.
#
# $VER: Delay.py_Version_0.00.04_(C)2007_B.Walker_G0LCU.

# Do any necessary imports.
import os

def main():
	print '\f'
	print '(C)2007, Barry Walker, G0LCU.'
	print
	print 'Email:-  wisecracker@tesco.net'
	print
	print 'URL:-    http://homepages.tesco.net/wisecracker/G0LCU.HTM'
	print
	print 'A five second time delay before clearing the screen.'
	print
	os.system('C:Wait 5')
	print '\f'
	# That's all there is to it... :)
main()

  General Assumptions:-
  ---------------------

  That You Should Have A Basic Knowledge Of:-
  -------------------------------------------

  1) How to set up the AMIGA.
  2) How to BOOT up the AMIGA into either a CLI, (Command Line Interface),
     or a WorkBench screen.
  3) How to use the Keyboard.
  4) How to use the Mouse.
  5) How to start programs from the CLI or WorkBench.
  6) The general operation of WorkBench, windows and requesters etc...
  7) How to format a floppy disk.
  8) How to create a BOOTABLE floppy disk.
  9) Safely connecting ANY external equipment to the AMIGA.

============================================================================

                                IMPORTANT:-

    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    An A1200(HD) in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes using trapdoor memory AND/OR
    PCMCIA memory expansions and OS3.0x+.

    It has been tested on a(n) HP Pavillion Notebook, model number
    'dv2036ea', running AF2005/WinUAE and Python Version 2.0x and works.
    The sound MUST be fully enabled for it to work though.

    All test conditions WERE/ARE using standard ~topaz 8~ fonts throughout.

    I have no idea what a strange configuration setup will create so refer
    to the ~The Legal Stuff~ above.

                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the AMIGA before disconnecting or connecting any hardware.
