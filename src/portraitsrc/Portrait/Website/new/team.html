<h1>Development team</h1><br>
<table>

Fill in the form below to become part of the Portrait development team.<br>
As part of the team you can contribute in the following ways:<br>
<ul>
<li>Programming - We need accomplished programmers in C++ and E (for non-Amiga visitors, E is currently an Amiga-specific language with an Amiga-specific compiler)<br>
The current sources for Portrait are written in E. I'm looking at porting them to C++ so that we can make as much of the sources as possible platform-independent. In this way the only platform specific parts will be the user interface, etc.<br>
<li>Testing - We need alpha and beta testers. You will be sent a distribution archive (including all the distribution files - not a snapshot of the current development status). You will be required to give regular feedback.<br>
<li>Artwork - We need people to do example artwork. The best pictures will be place in the gallery and will appear on the CD-ROM distributions. When a functional release of Portrait is finished it will be made available.<br>
</ul>
