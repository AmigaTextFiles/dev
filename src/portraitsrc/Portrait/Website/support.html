Problems / Technical support
</h1>
</b>
<p>
<b>Known problems:</b>
<i>V1.3</i>
There is no fallback for the screen mode, so if you don't have the monitor
specified in the default prefs, the program exits.
Cleanup doesn't work properly. If the program exits before it is fully
initialised (for whatever reason), it is likely to GURU.
The sliders, gradientslider and colorwheel don't interact properly in the
Colour window.
Fills are incredibly slow and don't always work. (Poor routine - uses
far to much stack for a start.)
Problems with scrollers, especially when zoomed.
Can't draw when zoomed??? (can't always reproduce this bug)
JPEG loader crashes if file isn't a JPEG.
</p>
<br>
If you have any specific problems then send an E-Mail to the address below.
Please be specific about what actually happens. Don't send bug reports for
versions before V1.4 if the program fails to start. (There are several known
problems in V1.3 and earlier which will cause the program to crash on
initialisation or bomb out and crash on cleanup.)
