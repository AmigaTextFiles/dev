%%
Changed separate colorwheel and gradientslider objects into one single
colourcombo object which incorprates the WHEEL_GRADIENTSLIDER tag.
Currently only two pens are allocated for the gradient slider. I need
to see some source code which uses both the ColorWheel and GradientSlider
together effectively (eg. Palette Preferences). There must be a better
way to do it than that which I am currently using.
%%
A few extra drawmode icons added (eg. clone.iff) ready for when those
features are added (should be soon).
%%
Did some preliminary work to allow the drawmode window to have two
columns (thus allowing more drawmodes :)

%%
Have started to rework the entire source.
Most stuff will be moved into objects and they will each have their
own, independant methods.
%%
Drew up a specification for new VMEM system, which should be faster and
more reliable. Fills in VMEM will still be slow though. (can't help this)
%%
Fixed some bugs with colourcombo, etc.
%%
No more random crashes (all the source I have converted to objects has
been checked, and no longer crashes :-)

%%
Started rewriting the virtual memory system. Caching is now more efficient.
All large memory blocks should be able to be stored on disk as well as in
RAM.
#

%%
Finished the core virtual memory system. Can now read/write using vmem
methods which will automically page memory in/out. (Fixed stupid bug caused
by no brackets around a macro - this meant memory got read from wierd
addresses all over the place.)

%%
CHANGES log file for period 04-Feb-99 to 07-May-99 lost :-(
%%
Full locale support, no hard-coded language strings except those in the
internal catalog.
%%
Rendering code completely rewritten.
%%
Preliminary support for default brush (single pixel).
%%
Some code put in place to support external savers/loaders.
%%
First attempt to compile in two months! :-)
%%
Lots of small changes. (Can't be bothered trying to remember everything
that's been done over the last couple of months)
%%
NB: Looked into the prospect of converting source to C (not a particularly
attractive option after rewriting the source from scratch once already!)
#

%%
Found redundant methods already [old copies of getlong()/putlong()]
%%
Duplicated some locale entries for clarity (all menu strings have MENU_
prefix, even if there is an equivalent with another prefix, for example)
%%
First successful compile.
#

%%
Added the catalog descriptor file.
%%
Took a look at ProjectManager for the first time in ages. May try to do
something with this in the next few weeks and release it as Freeware with
source.
