Short:
Portrait is a 24-bit paint package.

Long:
Still to be written.

Amiga compatible
AmigaOS 3.0+
8-bit capable display
VGA monitor recommended

This version:
NewIcons (standard icons will be supplied in the next version too)

Please note: The current version of Portrait requires a lot of Chip RAM
to hold its buffers. It may not be possible to edit large images (eg.
1024x1024), even with 2MB of Chip RAM. (This limitation should disappear in
future versions, see to do list).
Fast RAM is also recommended, although Portrait does have the ability to
use Virtual Memory if necessary. (Virtual Memory is built-in.)

@{b}Getting Started@{ub}

To run Portrait: Double-click the Portrait icon on the Workbench or
                 type "Portrait" at a CLI prompt.
It is recommended that you run PortraitMode before running the main
program (or you may find that the program does not start, because you
don't have the correct monitor driver, or the display mode cannot be
displayed on your monitor or TV).
Possible startup errors: (run-time errors are described in the online help)

@{b}Error@{ub}                     @{b}Cause@{ub}
Cannot open screen        Out of memory (especially chip memory)
                          Wrong display mode set in preferences (run
                          PortraitMode)
Cannot open window        Out of memory
Canvas error              Out of memory (especially chip memory)

Silent Exit               Out of memory
                          Cannot open needed library (check you have LIBS:
                          assigned to SYS:Classes, otherwise Portrait will
                          not be able to find the colorwheel.gadget or
                          gradientslider.gadget)

@{b}Bugs@{ub}

The program will exit silently if an exception is raised. Normally an error
will be posted before the exception is raised, but in some cases this
doesn't happen.

[I have fixed the following bug to an extent]

In some procedures, exceptions are raised for an error, and in others a bad
return code is set. In some cases this can mean that either the program
quits entirely, even if just a minor error occurs (eg. file not found) or
a major error may be ignored completely.
Virtual Memory isn't implemented as well as it could have been (I haven't
tested it that much - it may not work at all!)

[RGB colour selection is now implemented, but the gadget interaction
 still needs improving]

The ColourWheel and GradientSlider gadgets don't interact very well (which
can make selecting colours very difficult - hence the need for RGB colour
selection). 27/07/98 This is unacceptable (but I still haven't fixed it :-)

Datatypes loading isn't handled too well (some time in the future, the
datatypes will be handled by an external loader, along with specific
support for other image formats.

[This bug seems to have been fixed???]

Portrait seems to have a habit of trashing a random bitmap each time it
is run, eg. a blank strip will appear across a window not on the Portrait
screen. I can't seem to track this bug down and neither Enforcer nor
Mungwall seem to report any errors.

Project Manager is soooo full of holes. I have done no major work on this
since I first included it with the distribution. Expect to see a major
overhaul soon.

@{b}To Do@{ub}

* RGB colour selection
* Lines
* On-the-fly rendering of images (no need for second bitmap). This wil allow
  you to edit very large images (as long as you have enough disk space for
  the virtual memory.) At present the maximum size of an image is limited
  by the amount of free contiguous chip memory you have!
  (the size of the bitmap is width×height bytes for 8-bit screens)
  The best way to do this would be to have a bitmap which holds the
  rendered image for the window area, and then simply scroll this and
  render the new part of the image as necessary.
* Scrollers
* Shapes Window
* Rectangles (filled and unfilled)
* Project manager
· Ellipses    (filled and unfilled)
O Polygons
O Image Processing (I will probably implement basic image processing
  features, similar to the way they are implemented in "Personal Paint".
  I may consider adding an external image processor interface for more
  complicated effect, filters, etc.
O Grid
O Stencils (Will be very useful. I will write more about this in the future,
  but the idea is to have a separate stencil window and implement a "Magic
  Wand" function to aid in creating a stencil. This will allow functions
  to be preformed on just a selected area, rather than the whole canvas)
O Brushes
· Gradient Window (I will probably implement linear gradients first. Other
  types of gradients (eg. colour-burst) will come much later.
· ARexx interface
O External Savers and Loaders (IFF, BMP, PCX and JPG will be first because
  I already know the structure of these formats. Other formats will follow
  later. I plan in writing a loader/saver for the RISC OS !Sprite file
  format too. This will make Portrait the only Amiga paint package to
  support this format.)
O Printing
O Palette management (Lots to cover here. Will include things like exporting
  register based images as well.
X Animation
X Support for scanners and digital cameras
O Locale support (Will probably be implemented, but I will be doing no
  translations myself.
  Gradient Window
  Support for gfx-cards
  XPK compression for work buffer
  Plugins
  Effects
  Savers/Loaders

Items marked with an * above have been partially (or maybe completely)
implemented.
Items marked with an O will probably not be implemented in the forseeable
future.
Items marked with an X will probably never be implemented (but may be if
enough people ask me to.)

@{b}History@{ub}

V1.0 (31/12/97)  First WIP release. No documentation. Uploaded to Aminet
                 at short notice.
V1.12 (13/04/98) Internal release

GUI extensively improved.
Lots of tweaks to internal code.
Some compatibility problems solved.
Faster creation of remap array (no need for Portrait.remap file anymore).

PortraitMode included in the distribution (it somehow got left out last
time!)

V1.121 (20/04/98) Small update to V1.12

Much faster rendering speed for main buffer (I managed 10x !)

V1.2 (07/06/98) First major update for several months

V1.24 (27/07/98)

Scrollers now work (or should do)
Rendering code changed. Slower when scrolling (but only just implemented
scrolling anyway!), but supports much larger pictures (ie. chip ram is no
longer the limiting factor).
No longer requires NewWPA8 (very simple code change really).

V1.3 (17/09/98)

Rewrote rendering engine to use guigfx.library (which in itself requires
render.library). In the future I may supply an option in the Preferences
which will allow you to switch between guigfx.library and my own mapping
routine.
