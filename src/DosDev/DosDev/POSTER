Below is a concatenation of several Usenet headers from Matt's postings.
They contain useful information and provide sort of an "audit trail" for
the current distribution.

	O.K. folks, here it is.  Even with Andy's help I was unable to
get Info() (as in disk info) to work with it... It might have something to
do with my device node.  Everything else works, however.

	By the way, this is definately a *guru* posting.... don't even bother
if you don't know what a BSTR is.  This is NOT a utility, but an example for
those programmers interested in writing DOS device drivers.

	As usual, any and all Feedback will be appreciated.  I plan to do
another one in the future which exploits the packet types not implemented
in this one (some just don't apply to a simple ram disk).  I plan to update
this one as soon as I can figure out (or somebody can describe to me) how
to make the system recognize the thing in INFO and Info()... sigh.

	The binary is included in case some people have problems compiling
and want to compare their conglomeration with one that works.

	Thanks to Steve Beats and Andy Finkel, I've gotten ACTION_INFO
working properly.  Here's the update... plus the docs which somehow got
left out of the original distribution.

	It would seem that DOS does not unload the segment of the driver
after you flush it (by allocating too much memory).  Therefore, to test
multiple versions without rebooting (assuming you are writing your own
device driver), simply have multiple Mountlist entries with different
names.

	I fixed *many* bugs, and implemented a bit more of my sample RAM
disk (TEST: device):  It now timestamps files and works with the workbench.

	I would like to thank Steve Beats and all the people at Commodore
who helped me thrash out the problems!

	Those of you programmers who liked the original version are going
to love this one.
