			Amilock   Version 1.0.1
			    Release Version.

RELEASE CONDITONS -

	Bascially there are no conditions on the usage of this program no on the
source code (included in this archive, if it isn't contact me (see below)), though 
a little mention, if you decide to use parts of the code, wont, hurt, and I'd be
grateful, since I did use quite a bit of time coding the below system.  

	This program is PD, you may do with it as you wish, the code is free,
and if you have any questions about it, feel free to contact me.  (but please
give credit where credit is due, ie if you use it in a program of yours, 
give us a mention).

	The above address should be valid until the end of 1994.
	


TESTING

	This program was originally an attempt to stop people from trying to 
force access to the system, it was going to have a hard ware key along with it
however, due to the sucess of the multiuser filesystem development group, this
project is becoming too expensive to be of any real use, so it will die in its
infancy.  Thus the program Amilock was born, it has many of the features which
I Deviced to make the system safe, it will only temporarely protect it's own 
password file, which means it is not accessible while the system is accessible
this is a small feature which will prevent some one editing the file, if you 
turned your back for a moment, (you should have activated the program if you
leave the machine).

	The program will block all interactions with the user temporarely, 
without causing any problems with the system.  It does this by inserting a 
high priority interrupt server into the input.device interrupt queue, this 
then forces the keyboard and mouse to pass information to this server first.
the server interpretates the information and decides if it is allowed or not.
If the action is to be disallowed, it remaps it to something harmless, eg, a
left mouse button press is mapped to a right mouse button press (which is trapped
by the main program and nulled).  Any attempt to use the keyboard as an 
emergency mouse is also foiled, by the use of traps for keyboard entries.  
Any keyboard event considered improper, is simply Nulled, (the machine ignores
Null messages). 


TESTING

	I have now stopped work on this little program, it works, and has been
tested under the following conditions.

	Compatibility.

		Dos 3.0 (A4000/040) 	

		Dos 2.0x(A3000/030) 	(thanks to Derek
						(gldrm@manta.jcu.edu.au)).
			(A2000)
				
			(A500 )	 	(thanks to Gerard 
						(G.vanderHorst@research.ptt.nl))

	Usage.

		That is very simple, if you edit the password file, simply use
the format indicated, the first field is the user name the second is the 
password, the rest is required, but not used, and can be set to any thing.

	then

		Deamon 

			That boots the deamon, and sets the system up, temporarely
protecting the password file from tampering.  To remove this simply login as Root
this is hard coded, so no other username will be accepted, or in other words allow
tampering with the password file.

		login or logout (provided login is in the path)

			Your system is now untouchable except by the three (or one)
fignered salute.  the mouse continues to move as normal, however it does not
do any thing other than move.  I was going to block that as well, but I though
it was better to allow it to move.  (people tend to think a machine is frozen
if the mouse does not move :->)

	I can be contacted, at cemn@manta.jcu.edu.au (up untill end of next year).


	Enjoy, BTW this is my first Piece of PD!
