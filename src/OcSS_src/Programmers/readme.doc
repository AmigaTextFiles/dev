=================== Programmers' Source material copyright ===============

This is the OctaMED Source disk and it is fully Copyrighted to RBF Software
(Teijo Kinnunen and Ray Burt-Frost).

The source is NOT public Domain.

However, public domain libraries are very welcome to offer this material to
customers for no more than a very reasonable copying fee only.

If you have not allready applied for a programmers licence then it is in
your own interests to do so by printing out, (or copying), the included
copyright licence file titled "Licence.doc" and send it to:

            RBF Software.
            169, Dale Valley Road,
            Hollybrook,
            Southampton.

Those private/individual programmers that intend to use the libraries only
within and for release as Public Domain or Freeware programs, (no charges
made), are encouraged to make use of these routines in their progs.

Those programmers intending to release a program under the licenceware or
Copyright banner, MUST, (to avoid legal problems), READ ON:

Companies and Programmers that are intending to use the libraries within a
commercial, or even the now popular "budget" progs being sold via PD
libraries that pay the author a "share of the sales", MUST, to avoid
undesirable legal problems regarding the use of our Copyrighted libraries,
fill in and return the copyright licence form found on this diskette..

We believe all commercial/part-time programmers that are intending to earn
money from the routines will see this as fair, considering the high
earnings that are often forthcoming from their usage in such ventures and
the hard work that Teijo puts into this program.
