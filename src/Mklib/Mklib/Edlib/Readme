Edlib           copyright 1988  Edwin Hoogerbeets 
Version 1.0     04/08/88

Some time ago, I noticed a lack of certain useful functions in the Manx
C libraries that were mentioned in the Harbison and Steele C reference
manual. So, I wrote them. Since then, I have added a few of my own as
well as some from other people. Now, I think it's big enough to be
useful to others, so here it is!

This is the source and executable to the edlib runtime libraries. They
are for Manx 3.6a. (I have tried some of these functions with 3.4b when
I used to use that and they worked fine) A makefile is included with the
source. Two version of the library are provided: ed.lib for your normal
programming needs and the ed32.lib for those extra special 32 bit
programs.

This software collection is freely redistributable as long as no charge,
other than reasonable copy fees, is levied for them.

Thanks to Daniel J. Barrett for some of these functions, and to Henry
Spencer for getopt.

If you find any bugs, or have any other nifty-neato functions that you
find useful, please mail them to me at:
