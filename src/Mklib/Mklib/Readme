Mklib                   Copyright 1988 Edwin Hoogerbeets
Version 1.0             12/08/88

Some time ago, I started a project that was to use an Amiga shared library
for some of its functions. Unfortunately, almost all libraries before this
were written in assembler, and mine were written in C. So after some
searching, some kind soul (I forgot who, sorry) told me of elib of Fish 87.
I played with that and got it working. (Thanks, Jimm!) What I wanted,
though, was to write my routines in C and not fiddle with the assembler
interface, etc. So, I decided to write mklib and keep my fiddling with the
assembler to this one session. (thud thud <- knock on wood)

I know the scanner/parser is a kludge: it was quick and dirty. But it
works. Some assumptions are made about the C code: that the number of {
matches the number of } in a functions, that declarations only occur when
the numbers of { and }'s are equal, that the only valid functions are LONG
or ULONG and that everything else is rubbish.

I don't own the Lattice C compiler, so this code is not guaranteed to work
with it. If someone out there who does have Lattice hacks it into useable
code, please send me your changes and I will incorperate them into the next
(?) release.

Now the default stuff:

This software is freely redistributable as long as there is no charge
beyond resonable copy fees and as long as this notice stays intact.

Thanks to Jimm Mackraz for Elib on Fish 87, from which much of this program
is lifted. Also thanks to Neil Katin for his mylib.asm upon which elib is
based.

My address is:

(In Jan-Apr, back to work, then to school, every 4 months, etc...)

Now back to my original project that needed this library...
(it's like, properly nested projects, ya know)
