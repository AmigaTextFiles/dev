<ul>
 <li>Maybe RTG versions of the demo programs, which would then only
     use OS functions and therefore also work on GFX cards. Unfortunately
     I don't own a GFX card so all this is not very easy. Probably Picasso96
     under UAE is not very useful either as for example
     autoscrolling screens don't work correctly (PC with Matrox
     Millenium 2 PCI).<p></li>
     
 <li>If someone sends me some nice sprite graphics I might integrate
     triple buffering and some BOBs which fly around into the demo
     programs.<p></li>
