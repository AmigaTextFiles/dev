This algorithm and the one of <a href="xyunlimited-uk.html">Scroller_XYUnlimited</a>
are identical. The only difference is that the demo program was compiled with:<p>

<blockquote>
#define EXTRAWIDTH 64
</blockquote>
<p>

That way the bitmap width is a multiple of 64 and becomes suitable for 4x
FETCH Mode.
