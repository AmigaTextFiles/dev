<ul>
 <li>Scroller_XUnlimited is based on an article which long time ago appeared on
     the German Mag "Amiga Special". I don't recall the name of the author
     but I think his initials were M. L.<p></li>

 <li>All the other algorithms were invented by myself with some help of a program
     which allows searching bitmaps in CHIP RAM to check for example out
     how the bitmap of games like Turrican look like in memory.<p></li>
     
 <li>Many thanks go to Alexander Weber for helping with the documentation.</li>
