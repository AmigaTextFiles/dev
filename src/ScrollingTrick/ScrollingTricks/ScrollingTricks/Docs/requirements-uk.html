You should have basic knowledge of C, because 99 percent of the demo programs
are written in this language (the copperlist is the exception). Possibly,
having knowledge of Assembler and/or Pascal and/or Modula is also enough. 
Anyway you should know at least about the peculiarities of C (arrays, pointer
arithmetic, type casting, ...), otherwise you might stumble over things that
don't do what you think they do or things that don't look very logical.<p>

Average knowledge about how the Blitter and the Copper work and about the
Amiga-Chipset planar graphic format are necessary to understand the source
codes.<p>

The demo programs should work on all Amigas having a standard Amiga Chipset
(OCS, ECS or AGA). This is not true for the Draco, therefore the programs
won't run on that machine. The demo programs use PAL/NTSC screenmodes, therefore
your monitor must support a horizontal frequency of 15khz or must be used
together with a Scan Doubler/Flicker Fixer.

When using GFX cards there might be problems
because of the RTG Software and it's options (to force bitmaps to be
allocated in FAST RAM). Screen promoters might also cause some trouble.
