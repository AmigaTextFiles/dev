If you code a game based on this documentation and/or the demo source codes
(no matter if it is for the Amiga or not) and release it in some form (Aminet,
WWW, Cover Disk/CD, commercial, ...) then there are a few conditions:

<ul>
 <li>If the full version(!) of the game is not free (Freeware), then you must
     either send me a free copy of the game or, as alternative, 5 DEM (5000 LIT,
     3 US$) in cash. If the game is not an Amiga game please ask me first,
     whether I really want the game - I might not have the necessary hardware
     to use it.<p>
 </li>
 <li>If the full version(!) of the game is free (Freeware), and there is the
     possibility for me to download it from Internet, and the archive is no
     larger than 10 MByte, then you only need to let me know that your game
     was created with help of my documentation and/or demo source code.<p>
 </li>
 <li>If the full version(!) of the game is free (Freeware), but the archive
     is larger than 10 MByte and/or I don't have any possibility to download
     it from Internet, then what said at point one applies. That is, you either
     have to send me a free copy of the game or 5 DEM (5000 LIT, 3 US$) in cash.<p>
 </li>
 <li>A small credit in the documentation and/or the screen menus would be nice,
     but is not really required.
</ul>
