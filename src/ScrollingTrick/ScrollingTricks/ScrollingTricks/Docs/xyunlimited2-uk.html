This algorithm and the one of <a href="xylimited-uk.html">Scroller_XYLimited</a>
are very similiar. <a href="xyunlimited-uk.html">Scroller_XYUnlimited</a>
has many things in common as well. So read these documentations first!<p>

As in Scroller_XYUnlimited horizontal scrolling in the bitmap (!) is
restricted. But this time videoposx ranges between 0 and BITMAPWIDTH *
NUMPLANES - 1. So the covered area no longer just consists of one planeline
but of one whole pixel line. Again videoposy is used for compensation.
Since here we can do adjustments by one whole pixel line and not just one
planeline, the unit of videoposy may remain one pixelline.<p>

In this algorithm as well it may be necessary to do blockblits in two
steps. But it is no longer necessary to exclude the extraline from
blitting. The problem, that VIDEOSPLITTING cannot happen in the visible
area of a rasterline can be solved in a much easier and faster way, too.
It is no longer necessary to blit parts of the top bitmap into the
extraline in each frame. Instead, when videoposx is corrected (and only
then) depending on the scroll direction either the topmost pixelline
of the bitmap is blitted into the extraline (when scrolling left) or
the extraline is blitted into the topmost pixelline (when scrolling right).<p>
