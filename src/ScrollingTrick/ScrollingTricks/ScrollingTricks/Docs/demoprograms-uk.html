 <title>Demo Programs</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

The demo programs are desigend to be run from Shell. Anyway, thanks to the "CLI"
tooltype you can also launch them from Workbench. To scroll you'll need a joystick
connected to the second port. When holding down fire, scrolling will happen in
8 pixel steps, otherwise in 1 pixel steps. Clicking the left mouse button quits
the programs. Mouse and joystick are accessed through direct hardware calls.
Therefore one will have problems with certain mices/joysticks if they need
special drivers or are connected for example to the serial port.<p>

The following shell arguments can be specified:<p>

<table border=0 width="100%">
 <tr>
  <td valign=top><b>SPEED</b></td>
  <td>
   Shows the speed of the scroll routines. The smaller the yellow area (Copper bar)
   the faster they are.
  </td>
 </tr>
  <td valign=top><b>NTSC</b></td>
  <td>
   Uses the NTSC Norm for display instead of PAL. Do not specify this option if
   your monitor/TV does not support it! The scroll routines don't change their
   behaviour when activating this option. That is, the visible area will still
   be 320 x 256 pixels, but of course in NTSC mode vertically you won't be able
   to see all 256 pixels on your monitor/TV.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top><b>SKY</b></td>
  <td>
   Activates a copper sky. Works only with Scroller_XUnlimited,
   Scroller_XLimited and Scroller_XLimited_64.
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top nowrap><b>FMODE &lt;n&gt;</b></td>
  <td>
   Allows you to specify the FETCH Mode, which is only possible with the AGA
   chipset! The FETCH Mode defines the kind of access to the CHIP RAM. The
   access speed and the possible screen modes depend on it. Possible values are:<p>

   <blockquote>
    <table cellpadding=0 border=0>
     <tr>
      <td>0:&nbsp;</td><td>1x FETCH Mode (like ECS/OCS)</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>1:&nbsp;</td><td>2x FETCH Mode (normal CAS, 32 Bit Bus Width)</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>2:&nbsp;</td><td>2x FETCH Mode (double CAS, 16 Bit Bus Width)</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>3:&nbsp;</td><td>4x FETCH Mode (double CAS, 32 Bit Bus Width)</td>
     </tr>
    </table>
   </blockquote>

   2 (double CAS, 16 Bit Bus Width) does not seem to work, at least not on
   my computer. No matter what values I use for DDFSTART/DDFSTOP etc., everything
   I get is a display where the first 16 pixel column is ok, the second is not (it
   is instead an exact copy of the first 16 pixel column), the third is ok again,
   the fourth is not (it is an exact copy of the third 16 pixel column), ...
   That's not so much of a problem, because there is still the other 2x FETCH
   Mode (and of course the 4x FETCH Mode), which by the way is also used by
   the operating system if a screen's bitmap width is a multiple of 32 (but not
   64). I would be interested to know whether "fmode 2" on someone's computer
   out there works anyway. Let <a href="mailto:georg.steger@rolmail.net">me</a>
   know.
   
  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td valign=top><b>HOW</b></td>
  <td>
   This option is for showing how the scrolling algorithms work. A hires
   screen will be opened where you can see what happens to the bitmap
   internally when you scroll around.
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

Since the programs hack the hardware, disable interrupts, etc., there is a
certain risk. When starting/quitting there might well be crashes. Therefore
don't have important things running in the background. Instead do a save
and quit these programs. The demo programs only do read accesses on the
hard disk and use the operating system functions from dos.library for that.
So it is very improbable that your hard disk or it's content gets destroyed
and that similiar bad things happen. Of course I cannot give a 100 % guarantee.<p>

Before starting any of the demo programs you'll eventually have to disable
screen promoters and certain options in your RTG software. The programs only
work correctly if AllocBitmap() and OpenScreen() return what they were
requested to return. For example bitmaps in FAST RAM or changed DisplayIDs are not
good at all.
