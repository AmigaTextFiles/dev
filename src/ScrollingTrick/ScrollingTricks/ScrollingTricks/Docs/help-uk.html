<ul>
 <li>One of the two 2x FETCH Modes does not work, at least not on my
     computer. If someone knows why or if on someone's computer it does
     work (start demoprograms with option "fmode 2" and look whether the
     graphic is correct) it would be nice if you let me know.<p></li>
 
 <li>If in the function MainLoop() before starting the copperlist WaitBlit()
     is not called, then sometimes the actual blit operation (last block
     of screen filling in function FillScreen()) does not work correctly
     and foreign memory is trashed. I have no idea why this happens, but
     maybe it has something to do with the changing of the FETCH Mode.
     Possibly the Blitter does not like the CHIP RAM access mode to
     be changed while it is in action.<p></li>
 
 <li>The graphics and the design of the demo maps are everything but
     nice. I'm looking forward to get something better by someone ;-)
     If possible the map editor PowerCrawler (Aminet: gfx/misc/PowerCrawler.lha)
     should be used for this. Although this program is still Shareware,
     the actual version has no more restrictions in the unregistered
     version. The blocks should have no more than 16 colors (so that it also
     works on ECS computers - the option "HOW" uses a hires screen).
     The maps can consist of several PowerCrawler layers. Actually the
     demo programs don't support this, but future version might.</li>
