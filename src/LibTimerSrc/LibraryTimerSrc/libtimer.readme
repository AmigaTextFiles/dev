Short:    LibraryTimer assembler source

This is the source code for an old program I made - the LibraryTimer -
which is able to measure time-usage of library functions.
The archive with the binary can be found in dev/misc.

The source lacks a few macros, so you would probably have to hack your
way through the assembly. Good luck :)
