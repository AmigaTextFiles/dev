   This example demos the use of DOS packets, finding the Window ptr
and ConUnit ptr of the CLI window, toggling Raw mode, getting
cursor position and limits from the ConUnit, and ESC-seq cursor
positioning.

   The ConUnit structure (see devices/conunit.h or .i) has some
very useful information such as current and max cursor positions.
If you need similar info in an Intuition window / console.device
environment, you should be able to get your ConUnit ptr from
YourConsoleRequest->io_Unit.
