   I've never used the ESC sequence method of getting cursor position
reports in the read stream.  You don't say if you're in the CLI window
or in an Intuition window with a console.device.  This example shows
(among other things) how to get the pointer to the ConUnit structure
of the CLI window using a DiskInfo packet.  The ConUnit structure
contains lots of neat things, including current and maximum cursor
character positions.  

   If you're in an Intuition window with a console device attached,
you should be able to find the ConUnit pointer in YourIoRequest->io_Unit.
