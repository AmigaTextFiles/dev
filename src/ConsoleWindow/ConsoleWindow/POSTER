One question that comes up fairly often is given a DOS CON: or RAW:
window, how do you find the intuition pointer to it, so you
can do WindowToFront, graphics and other interesting things.

The answer lies in the following example.  Also, as an extra adde
bonus, under V1.2 you will also be told where the IOR for the console
device for that window is located, so you can play console.device
games also.  (The IOR is only returned under V1.2, but the window
pointer is returned under both...there's a check for a version number
in the program.)

		enjoy...
