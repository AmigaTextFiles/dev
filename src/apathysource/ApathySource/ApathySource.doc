                   Apathy - The Complete Source Code
                   =================================
                        Released in April 1996


COPYRIGHTS
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Apathy was released at The Party 5. The reason for releasing its source
code is that I know how hard it can be to find sources that are up to date.
There are however some restrictions.

The contents of this package are fully copyrighted by Henrik Magnusson
(RayLight) of PowerL¡ne, except for The Player replay routine (Copyrighted 
by Jarno Paananen / Guru of Sahara Surfers). You may NOT use anything in 
this package in order to produce similar effects/graphics/intros/demos 
without having my permission. (Which shouldn't be hard to get...)


COMPILING THE SOURCES
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You have to make an assign to this directory, named "!intro:". The sources
were compiled using PhxAss 4.2x and slink 6.50. The scripts that were used,
uses these programs. The scripts are:

MakeDotTunnel
MakeIntroIntro
MakeIntroLoader
MakeIntroSupport
MakeMiniWall
MakeWriter
MakeIntro

Run the scripts in this order to generate the executable. It's the 
"MakeIntro" script that links the objectfiles and creates the actual .exe
file.


THANKS TO
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Thanks to Guru of Sahara Surfers for his terrific player and to Frank
Wille for his wonderful assembler!
