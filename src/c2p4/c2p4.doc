c2p4.a (written by Peter McGavin) is a 4-plane chunky to planar covnverter
optimized for 020+ systems with fast mem.  It uses a comparison buffer (ie.
convert only what has changed from the previous frame).  Performs the first
two passes with the CPU and then passes 3 and 4 with the blitter.  Returns
immediately after starting the blitter (ie. your program can calculate the
next frame while the blitter is still running).

An example of the speedup possible is demonstrated with wolf3d.old and
wolf3d.new - use the joystick to move around and fire to exit.

wolf3d.old was taken from the wolf3d-2.lha archive, and was written by
russell@cpsc.ucalgary.ca (Terence Russell) using a "normal" c2p converter.

wolf3d.new was modified by peterm@maths.grace.cri.nz (Peter McGavin) using
the new c2p4.a converter

Enjoy!
