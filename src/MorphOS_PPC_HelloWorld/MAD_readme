Welcome to v0.4d of MAD - the first, alpha release of MorphOS Assembly Debugger.  

MAD has a number of limitations, some of which can be improved but one in 
particular that probably can't.  MAD requires its debuggee to be loaded within 
32MB of it.  If LoadSeg() does not happen to load the debuggee within this 32MB 
range, MAD recursively calls AllocAbs() until the nearest suitable block of 
memory is returned or quits if there is no such available memory.  

Obviously, debuggee programs with .text / code sections larger than 32MB will 
not be fully accessible by MAD.  

Another important limitation to be aware of is that MAD will only step through 
debuggee program instructions.  Any external programs such as system libraries 
will not be stepped through by MAD.  

Again, at this early stage of development I have chosen to spend as little 
time as possible on the interface.  The three program buttons are as follows:

single step - executes the current debuggee instruction.  

step past -   like single step except that any additional breakpoint set at a 
              branch destination will be cleared before executing the current 
              instruction.  This can have the effect of allowing a whole 
              subroutine to be executed.  The debuggee will continue to run at 
              full speed until the subroutine returns to where it was called 
              from.  
              
skip -        skips the current instruction.  


MAD has been developed and given some extent of testing on an Efika running 
MorphOS 2.7 with no modifications to the user interface.
