MyCalc (c) 2002 by J. T. Steichen is a program that allows
a programmer to calculate using either HexaDecimal or Decimal numbers.

Un-archive MyCalcPPC.lha where-ever you want it located.  Everything is in
a directory called MyCalc.

MyCalc is a commodity, so it can be placed in your WBStartup drawer 
(if you use it a lot).  The default hot key is 'Alt-c'.

The source code is included to allow others to see how to create a 
program that uses the commodities system of the AmigaOS.

If you modify/improve the Calculator (for example, adding Floating-point
support), please inform me & send me your changes so that I can use them
too!
