Short:    OpenGL BMP texture loader routines
Author:   walternn@rupert.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de (Norman Walter)
Uploader: walternn@rupert.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de (Norman Walter)
Version:  1.1
Replaces: GL_BMP_Load.lha
Type:     dev/src
Requires: C Compiler (e.g. StormC, gcc), StormMesa

By now i have only seen some texture loader routines for quite exotic
bitmap formats like sgi-rgb or ptt.
So why don't have a BMP loader routine?


Requirements:
-------------
The executable included in this archive requires 68030 cpu and 68881 fpu or better.
A 68060 or PowerPC CPU and a fast 3D-accelerator is highly recommended.

Expilicit: You NEED to install StormMesa to run the executable.
For compiling you need the linker librarys.

Download StormMesa from:

http://www.haage-partner.com/3dworld/index-e.htm

To run the executable, you need the user archive.
If you want to compile your own sources, you will need the developer
archive.

Install the packages according to their manuals.

Make sure to link the linker librarys to your executable while compiling.

GCC example: gcc demosource.c -o demo -lGL

Where "demosource.c" is the source code of your OpenGL program and "demo"
is the executable.

To obtain hardware-acceleration, you will need a GFX-card with 3D-Chip
(for example CyberVision 64/3D, CyberVisionPPC, Voodoo, etc.) AND
a Warp3D driver for your 3D-hardware.
OpenGL programs will run without 3D-hardware anyway, but slower.


Features:
---------
- Loads uncompressed 24 bit (Windows-)BMP textures
- Example with hardware acceleration where available
- System friendly as possible
- It`s fast, even on my good old A4000/030 with CV64/3D


New in this Version:
--------------------
- Simple intuition progress bar for texture loading

Remember:
---------
The S3 Virge can only perform hardware acceleration within 15 Bit screenmodes.

Testet on Amiga 4000/30 with CyberVision64/3D,
AmigaOS 3.5, CyberGraphX 3, Warp3D 3.
