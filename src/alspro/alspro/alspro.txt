This is some half-completed source code for ALSPro.  If someone wants to
finish the project then please e-mail me on the above address.

I'm not sure what state the code is in (it's probably a mess :), but I think
the basic outline of the game should be pretty clear.  There is a map editor
included in the archive, along with a few data files.
