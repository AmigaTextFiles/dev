Please send loads of money to...

Only joking (but you can if you want)

Game Concept
------------

Buy a lawnmower, and mow a lawn.  Certain obstacles and nice things will get
in the way and damage your mower, make you pay/give you loads of money and
other things etc. (It's a bit like Pacman, actually...)

The Gameplay
------------

What gameplay???

Menu Screen
-----------

1. Lawnmower Sales, inc.

The lawnmower shop - buy your 'mower here...

2. Lawnmower Repairs plc

The lawnmower repair shop, repair your 'mower here.

3. Lawnmower Upgrades Ltd.

The place to upgrade your 'mower
Warning: You can waste money by buying upgrades that do not work with your
'mower.

4. Go and Mow!

The only option currently available, but it doesn't do much because you
can't buy a lawnmower yet!

5. Quit

Doesn't exist, because you'll never want to stop playing... actually,
perhaps I will add it!

The Lawnmowers
--------------

Giftbox Mowmaster¹ - Really crap, "push-along-no-power"-type thing
... Grasschopper
Flymo Hovermower 5000¹ - The best, electric

Actually, I can't remember any more

¹ - Extra petrol tanks have no effect

The Levels
----------

1: Practice (from the side)
2: Ordinary*        } These
3: Bonus Level (3D) } Repeat

* Ordinary levels consist of:

Original (like the original?)
Football Pitch (like Football Janitor by Jake Dovey?)
Night Level (Even more like Pacman)
Rich Person's Garden (like erm... er...)

The levels decrease in time allowed, and increase in obstacles
Some of the later levels REQUIRE better lawnmowers

A number will be displayed before each level.  If you type this in you WON'T
get the same level - but no-one will notice anyway.

Controls
--------

Cursor keys - If I can get them to work
Redefinable keys - If I can be bothered
Q - Up    }
A - Down  } Standard
O - Left  } Spectrum-type
P - Right } controls

Obstacles/Rewards
-----------------

Blade of grass - appears at random and costs 10% mower price in repairs
Stone/Rock - blunts the blades of you mower and costs 25% in repairs
Tree - Running into this will seriously damage your mower - 50% price
Coke Can - Running over once shreads it, second time you cut your feet
Weeds - You will rewarded somehow
Flowers - look the same as weeds, but you have to pay for new ones

Football - Giving it a puncture will cost you
           (especially if its the newly-reclaimed 1966 world cup one)

Power Pills - Turbo boost

Winning
-------

Mow all the lawn (including the coke cans) as quickly as possible.  If you
complete it quick enough you will be rewarded - possibly with money to
