Modem is intended to be used to configure modems etc. without
having to load a terminal program; it can be used on any 
device/unit which acts like a serial.device.  I also use it for
dialing up to my slip account...

To use, simply type modem <devicename> <unit> <BAUD>.  It defaults
to serial.device 0 and your preferences setting.

I added the BAUD option because I needed 38400 and serial prefs
don't allow that!?!

To exit, type control-c.
