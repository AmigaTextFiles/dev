@NODE "Bugs" "Known Bugs:"
@PREV "Main"

   There are currently no known bugs in these programs.  They do NOT write to
   your hard disk, so even if there were some bugs, your Hard disks should
   not suffer because of them (but this is NOT a @{" guarantee! " LINK "Warranty"}).

@ENDNODE

@NODE "TroubleShooting" "TroubleShooting:"
@PREV "Main"

   Currently, the helpfulness of these programs is somewhat limited since there
   is no way to write the data gathered by the Disk Helpers back to your
   Hard Disk.  Eventually, other programs will be written to do this, so that
   saved Hard Disk blocks can be restored to a known working condition.
   Sorry about that, but @{" I'm " LINK "Author"} just one guy!
    
   Either that or someone should port RDBSalvage.c, SCSIEd, or QuarterBack Tools to
   the AmigaOne & AmigaOS4!

   You can obtain device names & unit numbers from the @{B}Media ToolBox@{UB} program that comes
   with AmigaOS4, @{B}just DO NOT do any saving to disk, etc.@{UB}
   
   The information generated by @{" ReadHardBlocksPPC " LINK "ReadHardBlocksPPC"} should be saved or printed 
   out on paper for future use.  The only useful information will be in the 
   first block & all the partition blocks (unless you can figure out what the BOOT blocks
   contain!).

     CheckSCSIVolPPC
     
  @{FG SHINE} DESCRIPTION @{FG TEXT}
     Read a SCSI Environment string & determine if the given volume is part
     of the environment variable.  The name of each environmental
     variable written by our companion program @{" SetSCSIEnvPPC " LINK "SetSCSIEnvPPC"} is as follows: @{FG SHINE}

       SCSIENV_10 @{FG TEXT}(which is SCSI (UnitNumber - 1) * 10 + LUN = 10)

     Each Environmental variable is written to ENVARC: AND ENV: by @{" SetSCSIEnvPPC " LINK "SetSCSIEnvPPC"}

     If you examine the @{" sample script " LINK "CheckForSCSI"}, you can see that you can use @{" SetSCSIEnvPPC " LINK "SetSCSIEnvPPC"} & this program
     to check for the existence & location of volumes that might be removable.  The original
     use @{" I " LINK "Author"} had for these programs involved Magneto-Optical disk drives that had removable
     media.
            
  @{FG SHINE} SYNOPSIS @{FG TEXT}
     int rval = CheckSCSIVolPPC envVariableName volumeName

  @{FG SHINE} RETURNS @{FG TEXT}
      5 (RETURN_WARN) if the volume name is part of the environment string.
     10 (RETURN_ERROR) or 20 (RETURN_FAIL) otherwise.

  @{FG SHINE} DESCRIPTION @{FG TEXT}
      Read a drive's capacity using HD_SCSICMD, then display the number of
      sectors & sector size on stdout.  The reason ReadCapacityPPC does not
      compute the actual size of the drive is because there are a lot of
      large disk drives available these days, which easily overflow 32-bit
      arithmetic.  32-bits can only represent numbers up to 4294967295 or
      around 4 GBbytes.  A good calculator should have no problem multiplying
      the results together to give you the Hard Disk's capacity.  Or you
      can re-write the code to use floating-point mathematics, just send @{" me " LINK "Author"}
      a copy of the modified source code!

   @{B}DISTRIBUTION
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~@{UB}
   This software package is @{B}ShareWare@{UB}. It may be put on any
   media which is used for the distribution of ShareWare, like Public
   Domain disk collections, CDROMs or FTP servers.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package, distributors
   should use the complete original distribution. The @{" author " LINK "Author"} cannot be held
   responsible if this software has become unusable due to modifications
   of the distribution contents or of the distribution files themselves.
   There is no limit on the costs of the distribution, e.g. for the media,
   like floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact disks, or the process of
   duplicating.  Such limits have been proven to be harmful to the idea of
   shareware, i.e., instead of reducing the price of the
   floppy disk below the limit, the software was simply removed from the
   master disk.

   Although the @{" Author " LINK Author} does not impose any limit on the 
   distribution of this software, he would like to express his personal 
   opinions on this matter:

   * This software package should be made available to everyone free of
     charge whenever it is possible (so they can send me money instead ;)).

   * If you have acquired this software package under normal conditions
     from a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk at a price higher than
     US $5, then you have definitely paid too much.  Please don't
     support this improper profit making any longer and switch to a
     less expensive source as soon as possible.
