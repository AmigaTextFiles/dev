              ZipWd Version 0.5 Public Domain

ZipWd needs at minimum OS 2.xx Version 37.xx .

ZipWd is a little tool which only runs from CLI.

It ziped the current active Window, that means it does the same
as when you activate the ZipGadget of the Window (in the right
top Corner beneth the DepthGadget).

It is useful if you want to zip a Window which ZipGadget you can`t
reach with the mousepointer.

It is much better to make a macro for a Functionkey than to use it
from CLI.
