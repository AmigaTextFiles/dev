 During the developement of my projects I've written some useful
macros that simplify some common problems. The macros have eventually
grown to full header files that I'm now using almost everywhere.

 I've packaged all these headers in a distribution archive, in the hope
that they will be useful to other programmers as well.


 - CompilerSpecific.h
	Defines wrappers for several compiler dependent constructs,
	including function attributes and register specification for
	function arguments. Supports SAS/C, gcc, EGCS, Storm C, Maxon C,
	DICE and Aztec C.

 - BoopsiStubs.h
	Using these inline versions of the amiga.lib boopsi support functions
	results in faster and smaller code against their linked library
	counterparts. When debug is active, these functions will also
	validate the parameters you pass in.

 - BoopsiLib.h
	Additional macros and inline functions for boopsi class developement.

 - DebugMacros.h
	Some handy debug macros which are automatically excluded when the
	DEBUG preprocessor symbol isn't defined. To make debug executables,
	you must link with debug.lib or any linker module containing a
	kprintf()-like function.

 - DiagnosticMacros.h
	Some handy macros to dump some common system structs to the
	debug console. Use DUMP_XXX(pointer) in your code to get a
	detailed dump of the structure contents.

 - ListMacros.h
	Some handy macros for list operations. Using these macros is faster
	than calling their exec.library equivalents, but they will eventually
	make your code a little bigger and are also subject to common macro
	side effects.
