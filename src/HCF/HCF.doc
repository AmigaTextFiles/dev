HCF

HCF is a program written in FALSE (source code included) which determines
the highest common factor of two numbers using Euclid's algorithm.

This states that the lower number should be divided into the higher one, and
the remainder noted. The higher number should be replaced by the lower one,
and the lower by the remainder. This should be repeated until the remainder is
equal to 0. The lower number would be the highest common factor.

This is shown in the code as "@[$0~][[\$@$@>~][$@\-\]#\]#\.". If you want to
know how it is done, e-mail me, or better still, work it out for yourself.
The FALSE language, with an explanation of the code, should be here
somewhere.

If you understand the language, you may think that there's some sort of check
for non-numerical characters. There is supposed to be, but it doesn't seem to
work properly, and it'd be too much hassle deleting it. If you're a complete
masochist, you can always try to sort it out for me...

Finally, this program was primarily written to give me something to upload to
Aminet, and even no-one ever needs it, it doesn't take up much space,
probably less than is left free on the CD. And if I'm wasting Washington
University's hard disk space and money, I can only see this as a good thing.

I can be contacted at the addresses below, if you can think of a reason why
you'd want to contact me...
