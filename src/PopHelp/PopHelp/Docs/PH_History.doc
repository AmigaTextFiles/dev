			The Making Of PopHelp
			=====================
(You may or you may not understand something about this memorandum of mine:)

PopHelp v1.00      (01.01.1992)
===============================
 - Well, everything has some kind of beginning...
 - Source 35901 bytes.
 - PopHelp is PD © MADD.
 - Only one menu - Commands: Copy, Rename, Delete, Move, MakeDir, Protect,
   UnProtect, Install, Dir, Execute, FileNote, About, Quit.
 - Copy: Type source and destination!  :-°
 - Dir: All entries on screen one by one...
 - CTRL-Q did not work since it was used as a menu short cut...
 - Window titlebar blank-type...

PopHelp v1.40      (18.01.1992)
===============================
 - PHWindow moved one pixel lower from screen top - makes it possible to use
   screen depth-gadgets without wasting time.
 - About and Quit moved to new menu: Pop.
 - New menu - Disk: Relabel, Format, DiskCopy, Install moved from Commands.
 - Disk commands do not use INHIBITOR and can not be interrupted.
 - DiskCopy has no one drive copy - Copies the disk to itself!  heh heh...
 - New menu - CopyBuffer: Allows you to use 32kb, 128kb or 256kb as a buffer
   when copying. Useful if having only one disk drive. [ hah!  8-) ]
   Own stupid checkmark...
 - Copy creates destination path itself. You do not need to write everything
   again. (wow!)
 - Dir can be exited with keyboard too...
 - Lots of code rewritten.
 - I was in a hurry and did not have so much time to test all this...

PopHelp v1.41      (19.01.1992)
===============================
 - Source 55179 bytes.
 - Same as PH1.40, BUT...
 - AAAARRRGGH !!! Of course, CopyBuffer did not work in PH1.40...
   The Copy command works normally, but only 15kb of the whole buffer is
   used so it does not matter which size you select...  NOW FIXED!
   Next time I try to test everything myself too....  (Pathetic!)

PopHelp v2.00p Pro (29.10.1992)
===============================
 - Source 120527 bytes + includes.
 - The next generation and lost interest version...
 - New 3D look! Window titlebar solid-type, popped window size bigger...
 - DeviceGadgets DF0:, DF1:, RAM:, DH0: <-hmmh...
 - OptionGadgets for DOS-command switches.
 - Action and messageborders for better info.
 - CTRL-Q not used for menus - works now with string-gadgets.
 - New menu - Special: Vectors, Make.fastdir, Show.
 - New menu - Preferences: Includes CopyBuffer with more options and SetSize,
   ScreenMode PAL/NTSC, Borders for WB1.3/2.x style, PHPointer with own
   arrow/BUSY-sign.
 - Copy and most other commands understand jokers (*,?) and can handle a
   directory - but not subdirectories...
   Had to work on Move/Delete jokers - can not Delete() if directory is
   Lock()ed!!!?  (was it only in RAM:?)   (urgh!)
 - Protect and UnProtect now in same command and you can modify all flags -
   not just delete...
 - Dir recoded. Separate dirs/files, FIRST-gadget, memory/last -dir, use
   trackdisk or '.fastdir' file, arrowgadgets to scroll directory (tried also
   keyboard but gave it up...), use mouse to select subdirectories, can not
   exit with keyboard...
 - New commands: Type (only ASCII), SetClock.
 - Format has Quick option, optional Verify (earlier MUST), MarkBADD broken
   sectors.
 - DiskCopy has one drive copy, optional Verify, Date destination after copy.
 - Install has NoBoot option.
 - Disk commands use INHIBITOR and can be interrupted with ESC...
 - Everything(?) improved! See for yourselves!
 - The OffGadget()s are slow!
 - This should have been v1.00!!!
 - Maybe I test it all next time...

PopHelp v2.40 Pro  (09.06.1993)
===============================
 - Source 116668 bytes + includes (lots of things moved there)
 - PopHelp is FreeWare and © MpL - MADD died...
 - PopHelp is residentable. Menus, gadgets and some other stuff are now being
   BUILT! (Did you not know that it is cheap to build in Finland now?)
   -> Executable size is smaller than PH2.00p!
 - GadgetOff()s speeded up with a trick. Speed improved considerably.
 - SizeWindow()'s NEWSIZE removed and now we use something else. Have you
   ever tried to run multiple PopHelps and then exited many of them about the
   same time - something gets stuck!!!
 - Quit confirm removed.
 - Dir: The last directory on the screen when exited is now LastDir, not the
   one that was last read in.
 - Type can handle powerpacked files PP20/PX20.
 - MarkBADD marks only blocks or the whole track. I do not know if there is
   any use for the Blocks option but it is still there...
   Number of bad blocks also reported after format.
 - PHPointer has now KS2.x style arrow/busy-pointers instead of the stupid
   old ones.
 - Disk commands (most?) check better for write/(read?) -errors.
 - Dir/LastDir: Titlebar was changed even if you tried to read a new dir and
   it was not succesful...
 - Dir/TrackDir now changes titlebar before trying to access dir and reports
   if it is not found.
 - TrackDir had keyboard exit on error - removed.
 - MakeDir can create many directories with same command + errors.
 - ClrDirScr did not return APen to white.
 - Popped-up window size made a bit smaller - MsgBorder has max 4 lines.
 - KeyToCont_Sub uses BusyPtr while waiting...
 - DOS error #? in new color and DisplayBeep() used!
 - Couldn't Lock() 'filename' (or whatever) changed to Couldn't Lock() File
   because the filename is displayed somewhere anyway... (?)
 - Preferences/Save preferences to 'S:PH.prefs'...
 - DiskCopy: 'Error DFx:' - number of drive is OK again...
 - Install/Relabel/ReName/MakeDir/SetClock have RemGs/AddGs now.
 - No flash on FIRST-gadget when clicking empty.
 - Copy/Move replace and Delete unprotect -> No -> ClrMsgBorder.
 - Delete/FileNote have ID Failed!  DOS_Err has ClrMsgBorder. (There should
   not be many more text-out-of-window situations anymore.)
 - Delete xxx:dir ALL does not freeze anymore. (AddGs was done twice!)
 - TrackDir seems to work with FFS too. (At least in KS2.x...)
 - If you clicked DriveGadgets too fast when the second string-gadget was not
   enabled the first string-gadget went off. If you now clicked OptionGadget,
   the second string-gadget was activated against the rules...
   If the other string-gadget is turned off it will not be Refresh()ed -
   it was flashing sometimes......
 - FileNote with blank comment -> remove - works again.
 - Dir&Type have BusyOn also in PHWindow.
 - Create.fastdir has 'Creating .fastdir'-message.
 - BigWindow/SmallWindow have small OffGs/OnGs change..
   Activated OptionGadgets deactivated if you use different command!
 - DriveGadgets 'ghosted' in About, SetClock_save and SetSize - you were able
   to use chars in size by pressing DriveGadgets.
 - ClrMsgBorder in Copy_Err. If there is an error in Copy, incomplete
   destination file is deleted.
 - Format&Install have FastFileSystem-option.
 - CopyBuffer 'k' changed to 'kb' (kilobyte). (Or should it be kB, KB, Kb?)
 - Relabel changed to ReLabel... (?)
 - Selecting Vectors/something does not activate Show anymore.
 - EnterParmsTitle now set in BigWindow.
 - No AllocMem() in Disk_Busy - we use UseOnlyNowBuf...
 - Some stupid error-things improved...

PopHelp v2.46 Pro  (14.09.1993)
===============================
 - Source 116981 bytes + includes.
 - Flags&Comment work on Copy again.
 - Disk swapping reduced when Copying with one drive... (before 9 - now 3!?)
 - CopyBuffer has now only AutoSize&SetSize. (PrefsFile V2 now in use...)
 - TrackDir on No DFx: had no RemGs and froze...
 - In old Copy-routine, when you copied only one file and removed disk too
   fast after writes (without TrackSalve's update) the destination file was
   'empty'. This should not happen anymore as long as you do not remove disks
   when the drive light is still on. (Just act normally!)
 - One drive DiskCopy has 50kb minimum memory safety limit to leave some
   space to breath.

PopHelp v2.58 Pro (20.12.1994)
==============================
 - Source 121823 bytes + includes
 - The army cleared my head so now to something completely different...  :)/
 - The year is 1994!...
 - Format/Date modified earlier only the disk's last modification date.
   Now we set the disk's creation and last modification dates to the
   current system date&time.
 - Dir now displays free disk-space in kilobytes instead of blocks.
 - DiskCopy with two drives uses double-buffering so its a bit faster now.
 - Show improved. Shows brushes, full page pics, compressed or not.
   Powerpacked files supported.
   UnCompress one BytePerRow too small -bug fixed. Should now show most pics.
   Ptr turned off.
 - 'Dir of...' changed to 'Dir Of...'  (I think I've done this before...?)
 - DiskBuf CopyMem() turned to CopyMemQuick()... look at that speed!
 - Border colors are set automatically according to OS version (unless prefs
   say something else).
 - Inserted KS20+ style version string $VER:.
 - PH froze when exiting LastDir if TrackDir was also selected! (RemGs was
   not executed)
 - Changed kb to K...  Is it OK now?
 - 'Enter required parameters...' changed to 'Working...' when really doing
   something.
 - 'Trying to get pp file...' displayed if that is the case.
 - Docs also in AmigaGuide®-format.
