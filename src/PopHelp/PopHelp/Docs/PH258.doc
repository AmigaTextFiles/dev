		 PopHelp v2.58 Professional By MpL
		===================================

About PopHelp:
--------------
  PopHelp is FreeWare, but still copyrighted by MpL. Feel free to distribute
 PopHelp as much as you like, provided that you include all files listed
 below. PopHelp may not be sold for profit. You may not change these files.
 PopHelp is not guarateed to do anything useful. Use at your own risk.
 If you do find this program useful, how about sending me some kind of a
 small bribe...

  PopHelp is a small (about 27K) utility which includes some important DOS-
 commands and tools in one package. PopHelp is fully programmed in assembler
 (executable compiled with A68k). PopHelp was programmed on an A500 with
 KS1.3 so if you have a better configuration (and who has not?) you may find
 this program a bit useless. I myself have even used this couple of times.
 Well, at least I had something to spend my spare time to. This version was
 released on 20.12.1994. See the 'PH_History.doc' file to see updates and
 bugfixes from earlier versions.

  These files should be included in this package:
   - PopHelp		= The executable
   - Pophelp.info	= Icon for WB use
   - PH258.doc		= How to use PH
   - PH258.guide	= Same in AmigaGuide format
   - PH_History.doc	= How it all began

Installing and running:
-----------------------
  This part is going to be easy! To use PopHelp, just copy the executable
 wherever you want to. You do not need to install any fancy libraries or
 fonts. PopHelp does not need them. However, there are couple of libraries
 that give you access to special files. Read on to find out more.

  Use 'Run' command to run PopHelp from CLI/Shell. You may also run it from
 Workbench by double-clicking its icon. Once activated PopHelp will open a
 small window and display free memory and time on it. PopHelp will also try
 to access preferences file 'S:PH.prefs'. This file does not have to exist.
 If nothing happens, there was an error: ROM-libs could not be opened, not
 enough memory etc. PopHelp does not need any special libraries etc. to run,
 so this should not happen very often. If it does, something is quite wrong!
 PopHelp should work with KickStart1.2 and higher. PopHelp can be made
 resident.

Using PopHelp:
--------------
  Press the right mouse button to see the menus. Select one of the commands
 with mouse or keyboard short cuts. After that a window will pop up and you
 are asked to enter parameters for the selected command. However, some simple
 commands may not need any kind of parameters.

  On the top of the window you can see two string-gadgets with some kind of
 explanation about the required parameters. Note that if you have earlier
 entered some parameters, they are still present in the gadgets. You can
 edit them or press RightAmiga+X to clear the string (RightAmiga+Q brings
 it back). After you have entered the first parameter, press Return and you
 can enter the second parameter (if only one parameter is needed, the second
 gadget will be 'ghosted' and you can not use it).
 You can also activate one of the string-gadgets with mouse. After entering
 the required parameters (one or two) and pressing Return, the command will
 be executed. If you leave both or one of the string-gadgets blank or press
 the window's close-gadget, the command will be cancelled.

  Below the string-gadgets there are four drive-gadgets for the most usual(?)
 devices: DF0:, DF1:, RAM: and DH0:. Clicking one of these will clear the
 active string-gadget and copy the device string into it. After that you can
 add, for example, a filename.

  Below the drive-gadgets you see the option-gadgets. These usually contain
 some kind of options, like the corresponding DOS-commands. Activate or
 deactivate the ones you want. If you activate some option-gadgets they
 will stay activated until you deactivate them, as long as you use the same
 command. When you select another command that has options, these option-
 gadgets will be deactivated so that you do not need to 'clean up' them,
 since the new command probably has different options. Option-gadgets that
 are not currently used are 'ghosted'.

  Below the option-gadgets you can see two thin borders. These spaces will
 usually contain some information about the execution of the command. This
 helps you to keep up with what is going on.

  The lowest big border is used to print errors or small messages that
 usually require some kind of response from the keyboard, like 'y' for yes,
 'n' for no or maybe just a pressing of Return.

Here are the menus and commands in them:
----------------------------------------
Pop:
----
About:		 Displays some information about PopHelp.

Quit:		 Exits Pophelp. You can also exit by clicking the window's
		close-gadget.

Commands:
---------
Copy:		 Enter source and destination file/path. '*' and '?' can be
		used as wildcards. (e.g. 'df0:*', 'Disk:C/Prgv1.?')
		You can copy several files by using these wildcards. However,
		if you copy a directory you can copy only one at a time since
		subdirectories are ignored. If you copy into a destination
		directory that does not exist, you will be asked if you would
		like it to be created before proceeding. If a destination
		file already exists, you will be informed and asked if you
		would like to overwrite it. If an error occurs during the
		copy, incomplete destination file will be removed. PopHelp
		also checks if there is enough disk-space on the destination
		path. If not, you will be informed and the file will not be
		copied. This, however, is ignored when copying to RAM: since
		it is always 'full'.
		If 'Flags' is selected, the destination files will have the
		same protection flags set than the source files. 'Comments'
		will preserve comments. See Preferences/CopyBuffer!

ReName:		 Enter the old file/directory name and then the new name for
		it.

Delete:		 Just enter the file/path to be deleted. Wildcards (*,?) can
		be used. If you delete a directory and 'All' is selected, all
		files in that directory will be deleted and after that the
		directory itself. However, subdirectories are skipped.
		If you try to delete a file/dir that is protected from
		deletion you will be informed about that and asked if you
		would like to unprotect the file and delete it after that.

Move:		 Works as the 'Copy' command, but this deletes the source
		after copying it. First enter the file/path to be moved,
		press Return and enter the destination path/file and hit
		Return again. Comments and flags will be automatically
		preserved.

MakeDir:	 Give the name of the directory to be created. Multiple
		directories can be created at a time. 'DF0:dir1/dir2/dir3'
		would create directory 'df0:dir1' which would contain
		subdirectory 'dir2' (df0:dir1/dir2) which would contain
		subdirectory 'dir3' (df0:dir1/dir2/dir3).

			DF0: -- dir1
				   |
				  dir2
				     |
				    dir3

Protect:	 Set the protection flags as you want and then enter the
		file/path to be protected. Wildcards (*,?) can be used.

Dir:		 Enter the directory to be displayed and press Return.
		If no directory name is entered, the current work directory
		will be shown. The directory window is divided in two spaces.
		On the left side you see the subdirectories this directory
		contains. On the right side are the files and their sizes
		in this directory. On the bottom is displayed the number of
		subdirectories and files in this directory, available disk-
		space in kilobytes and the amount of bytes in the files.
		There are also some arrow-gadgets (top, bottom, page/row
		up/down). With them you can scroll the directories on screen
		if they are too long to fit in one page.
		You can enter a subdirectory by clicking mouse on its name
		on the left side. After this the FIRST-gadget will bring back
		the first directory. You can exit 'Dir' by clicking the
		window's close-gadget.
		'.fastdir' option uses '.fastdir' file if one is found. This
		is an old invention used at least by 'CLI-Mate' program
		but I decided to include it anyway. The directory is stored
		in a file and it loads faster than normal directory. See
		Special/Make.fastdir! 'TrackDir' uses trackdisk to read
		the directory. This might be a bit faster than directory read
		by normal means at least with long directories under OFS and
		KickStart1.2/1.3. 'Last Dir' (memory dir) displays the last
		directory which was displayed on screen when exited. This
		will save time if you need the same directory many times.

Execute:	 You can execute a DOS-command with this command the same way
		you would do it in CLI/Shell. This uses 'Run' command (which
		has to be available). A small window will be opened for
		possible text output.

FileNote:	 Allows you to set a comment on a file. These comments can
		be displayed with DOS's 'List' command. To remove the comment
		enter a blank comment. Wildcards (*,?) can be used.

Type:		 Displays ASCII file. Just enter the file name. If the file
		is powerpacked it will be decrunched provided that power-
		packer.library is found in your LIBS: (and reqtools.library
		for the password, if the file is crypted). If not, the
		file will be displayed as normal ASCII and it may look a bit
		strange. You can scroll the text in the window with the
		arrow-gadgets. Press the window's close-gadget to exit.

SetClock:	 'Reset' will reset the battery backed up clock. Use this
		if your Amiga does not recognise the clock while SetClocking
		in DOS.	'Load' loads the current time from the clock and sets
		the system time. 'Save' asks you to enter the current date
		and time as DD-MM-YY HH:MM:SS and saves them in the clock.
		(e.g. 26-09-92 22:08:02 or 26-9-92 22:8:2)

Disk:
-----
ReLabel:	 Changes a disk name. First enter the drive where the disk is
		and then the new name for the disk.

Install:	 Just enter the drive to be installed. This command installs
		a normal DOS-boot. 'NoBoot' removes the boot. If 'FFS' is
		selected the boot will be in FastFileSystem format to be used
		with KickStart2.x+.

Format:		 Enter the drive to be formatted and a name for the disk.
		'Quick' option initializes only the boot and root blocks.
		'Verify' determines if the format will be verified.
		If 'Install' is selected, the disk will be installed with
		normal DOS-boot after the format. 'FFS' uses FastFileSystem
		format. 'MarkBADD' works like a program called 'BADFormat'.
		If it finds damaged blocks, they will be marked as used. Then
		those bad blocks won't cause any read/write errors but you
		can still use the 'healthy' parts of the disk.
		See Preferences/MarkBADD!

DiskCopy:	 Copies a whole disk to another disk. Enter the source and
		destination drives. You can use one or two drives. If you use
		only one drive you may have to change disks several times.
		This depends on the amount of free memory. PopHelp copies as
		much data into memory as possible (PH tries to preserve at
		least 50K of memory available so that your system has
		something to work in) and asks you to change disks after
		that. 'Verify' determines if the copy is verified.
		You can't have two identical disks in the drives at the same
		time. If 'Date' is selected, the destination disk's creation
		and last modification dates will be modified. This makes the
		disks look different so that AmigaDOS can separate them.
		If I remember right, KickStarts1.2/1.3 have a bug, so this
		won't normally help. TrackSalve tries to do something about
		it, so use it. In KickStart2.x and higher 'Date' should have
		the required effect.

Special:
--------
Vectors:	 This menu displays some strategic vectors. The reset vectors
		should normally be zero. Hope you do not have any viruses!

Make.fastdir:	 This command creates a '.fastdir' file in the specified
		directory. The '.fastdir' file is identical to files created
		with a program called 'CLI-Mate'. See Commands/Dir!

ShowGfx:	 View graphics. You can show IFF ILBM files and
		workbench icon (.info) files. If the shown icon has two
		images, you can toggle between them by pressing Return.
		PopHelp needs 'icon.library' to view icons.
		Powerpacked ILBMs supported if powerpacker.library is
		available.

Preferences:
------------
CopyBuffer:	 This affects the size of the buffer used by the 'Copy' and
		'Move' commands. 'AutoSize' allocates a buffer according to
		the file size, so that the copy can always be done in one
		part. 'SetSize' allows you to set a fixed size to the
		buffer by typing it in kilobytes from the keyboard. After
		that this size will be used for every file.
		For example, if you want to copy a 50K long file and you
		use AutoSize, the buffer size will automatically be adjusted
		to 50K. If you use SetSize and set the buffer to 50K the
		file can also be copied in one part. However, if you set the
		buffer size to 32K the file must be copied in two parts.
		(If PH fails to allocate the AutoSized buffer it tries to
		allocate the SetSized buffer!)
		Note that the memory for the buffer is allocated only when
		the 'Copy' and 'Move' commands are used. Otherwise it is
		free to be used by other programs.

ScreenMode:	 Select PAL or NTSC size. When PopHelp opens other windows,
		like in 'Dir' and 'Type', you can have a window that covers
		the whole screen (more text!) if you have a PAL Amiga. You
		can't select PAL if your Amiga is in NTSC mode.

Borders:	 This affects the outlook of the 3D-things. KickStarts1.2/1.3
		and 2.x+ have usually white and black colours swapped, so
		this helps the borders not to look strange. Pick up the one
		you like the best!

MarkBADD:	 When you use the 'MarkBADD' option in 'Format', bad blocks
		are marked as used so that they will not be used by DOS.
		However, AmigaDOS usually reads and writes only full tracks
		at a time. If we mark only couple of blocks in a track used,
		also those blocks will be read and written anyway every time
		the track is used and they will cause trouble. So, in this
		case it is no use marking only those couple of blocks. If we
		want to	have some advantage, we have to mark the whole track.
		There is also the 'old' option which marks only blocks but
		you should use the option that marks whole tracks. (There are
		80 cylinders on a disk (0-79), a cylinder consists of 2
		tracks,	one on each side of the disk and a track consists of
		11 blocks.)

PHPointer:	 Use PopHelp's built-in pointer. This pointer is displayed
		when PopHelp window is active and it is currently the normal
		KickStart2.x+ pointer. When PopHelp does something for longer
		time or is waiting for response, the pointer will be usually
		changed to KickStart2.x+ style clock, even if this option is
		not enabled.

SavePrefs:	 Saves the current preferences settings to a file called
		'S:PH.prefs'. When PopHelp is run, it checks for this file
		and sets the preferences according to the file.
