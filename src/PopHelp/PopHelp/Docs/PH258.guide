@node ABOUTPH "What Is PopHelp?"

@{b}About PopHelp:@{ub}
--------------
  PopHelp is  FreeWare, but still copyrighted by  MpL.  Feel free to
 distribute PopHelp as much as you like, provided that you include all
 files listed below. PopHelp may not be sold for profit. You may not
 change these files. PopHelp is not guarateed to do anything useful.
 Use at your own risk. If you do find this program useful, how about
 sending me some kind of a small bribe...

  PopHelp is a small (about 27K) utility which includes some important
 DOS-commands and tools in one package. PopHelp is fully programmed in
 assembler (executable compiled with A68k). PopHelp was programmed on an
 A500 with KS1.3, so if you have a better configuration (and who has not?)
 you may find this program a bit useless. I myself have even used this
 couple of times. Well, at least I had something to spend my spare time to.
 This version was released on 20.12.1994. See the 'PH_History.doc' file to
 see updates and bugfixes from earlier versions.

  These files should be included in this package:

	- PopHelp		= The executable
	- Pophelp.info		= Icon for WB use
	- PH258.doc		= How to use PH
	- PH258.guide		= Same in AmigaGuide format
	- PH_History.doc	= How it all began
@endnode

@node INSTALRUN "What Should I Do With The File?"

@{b}Installing and running:@{ub}
-----------------------
  This part is going to be easy! To use PopHelp, just copy the executable
 wherever you want to. You do not need to install any fancy libraries or
 fonts. PopHelp does not need them. However, there are couple of libraries
 that give you access to special files. Read on to find out @{" more " link MORE}.

  Use 'Run' command to run PopHelp from CLI/Shell. You may also run it from
 Workbench by double-clicking its icon. Once activated PopHelp will open a
 small window and display free memory and time on it. PopHelp will also try
 to access preferences file 'S:PH.prefs'. This file does not have to exist.
 If nothing happens, there was an error: ROM-libs could not be opened, not
 enough memory etc. PopHelp does not need any special libraries etc. to
 run, so this should not happen very often. If it does, something is quite
 wrong! PopHelp should work with KickStart1.2 and higher. PopHelp can be
 made resident.
@endnode

@node MORE "What About Those Special Libraries?"

@{b}Helpful libraries:@{ub}
------------------
  To view WorkBench icon files you must have the @{b}icon.library@{ub} present.

  To view powerpacked text files or IFF pictures you must have the
 @{b}powerpacker.library@{ub} present. If the file is crypted PopHelp needs also
 the @{b}reqtools.library@{ub} to ask for the password.
@endnode

@node USING "How Do I Use PopHelp?"

@{b}Using PopHelp:@{ub}
--------------
  Press the right mouse button to see the menus. Select one of the commands
 with mouse or keyboard short cuts. After that a window will pop up and you
 are asked to enter parameters for the selected command. However, some
 simple commands may not need any kind of parameters.

  On the top of the window you can see two string-gadgets with some kind of
 explanation about the required parameters. Note that if you have earlier
 entered some parameters, they are still present in the gadgets. You can
 edit them or press RightAmiga+X to clear the string (RightAmiga+Q brings
 it back). After you have entered the first parameter, press Return and you
 can enter the second parameter (if only one parameter is needed, the
 second gadget will be 'ghosted' and you can not use it).
 You can also activate one of the string-gadgets with mouse. After entering
 the required parameters (one or two) and pressing Return, the command will
 be executed. If you leave both or one of the string-gadgets blank or press
 the window's close-gadget, the command will be cancelled.

  Below the string-gadgets there are four drive-gadgets for the most
 usual(?) devices: DF0:, DF1:, RAM: and DH0:. Clicking one of these will
 clear the active string-gadget and copy the device string into it. After
 that you can add, for example, a filename.

  Below the drive-gadgets you see the option-gadgets. These usually contain
 some kind of options, like the corresponding DOS-commands. Activate or
 deactivate the ones you want. If you activate some option-gadgets they
 will stay activated until you deactivate them, as long as you use the same
 command. When you select another command that has options, these option-
 gadgets will be deactivated so that you do not need to 'clean up' them,
 since the new command probably has different options. Option-gadgets that
 are not currently used are 'ghosted'.

  Below the option-gadgets you can see two thin borders. These spaces will
 usually contain some information about the execution of the command. This
 helps you to keep up with what is going on.

  The lowest big border is used to print errors or small messages that
 usually require some kind of response from the keyboard, like 'y' for yes,
 'n' for no or maybe just a pressing of Return.

@node POP "The Pop Menu"

@{b}Pop:@{ub}
  This menu contains some basic functions.
@endnode

@node ABOUT "What Are You Using?"

@{b}About:@{ub}
  Displays some information about PopHelp.
@endnode

@node QUIT "How To Quit?"

@{b}Quit:@{ub}
  Exits Pophelp. You can also exit by clicking the window's close-gadget.
@endnode

@node COMMANDS "The Commands Menu"

@{b}Commands:@{ub}
  This menu contains the commands that are used to manipulate files.
@endnode

@node COPY "Copying Files"

@{b}Copy:@{ub}
  Enter source and destination file/path. '*' and '?' can be used as
 wildcards. (e.g. 'df0:*', 'Disk:C/Prgv1.?') You can copy several files by
 using these wildcards. However, if you copy a directory, you can copy only
 one at a time since subdirectories are ignored. If you copy into a
 destination directory that does not exist, you will be asked if you would
 like it to be created before proceeding. If a destination file already
 exists, you will be informed and asked if you would like to overwrite it.
 If an error occurs during the copy, incomplete destination file will be
 removed. PopHelp also checks if there is enough disk-space on the
 destination path. If not, you will be informed and the file will not be
 copied. This, however, is ignored when copying to RAM: since it is always
 'full'.
  If '@{i}Flags@{ui}' is selected, the destination files will have the same
 protection flags set than the source files. '@{i}Comments@{ui}' will preserve
 comments. See @{" Preferences/CopyBuffer " link COPYBUFFER}!
@endnode

@node RENAME "ReNaming Files"

@{b}ReName:@{ub}
  Enter the old file/directory name and then the new name for it.
@endnode

@node DELETE "Deleting Files"

@{b}Delete:@{ub}
  Just enter the file/path to be deleted. Wildcards (*,?) can be used.
 If you delete a directory and '@{i}All@{ui}' is selected, all files in that
 directory will be deleted and after that the directory itself. However,
 subdirectories are skipped. If you try to delete a file/dir that is
 protected from deletion you will be informed about that and asked if you
 would like to unprotect the file and delete it after that.
@endnode

@node MOVE "Moving Files"

@{b}Move:@{ub}
  Works as the @{" Copy " link COPY} command, but this deletes the source after copying
 it. First enter the file/path to be moved, press Return and enter the
 destination path/file and hit Return again. Comments and flags will be
 automatically preserved.
@endnode

@node MAKEDIR "Creating Directories"

@{b}MakeDir:@{ub}
  Give the name of the directory to be created. Multiple directories can be
 created at a time. 'DF0:dir1/dir2/dir3' would create directory 'df0:dir1'
 which would contain subdirectory  'dir2'  (df0:dir1/dir2)  which would
 contain subdirectory  'dir3'  (df0:dir1/dir2/dir3).

			DF0: -- dir1
				   |
				  dir2
				     |
				    dir3
@endnode

@node PROTECT "Protecting Files"

@{b}Protect:@{ub}
  Set the protection flags as you want and then enter the file/path to be
 protected. Wildcards (*,?) can be used.
@endnode

@node DIR "Displaying A Directory"

@{b}Dir:@{ub}
  Enter the directory to be displayed and press Return. If no directory
 name is entered, the current work directory will be shown. The directory
 window is divided in two spaces. On the left side you see the
 subdirectories this directory contains. On the right side are the files
 and their sizes in this directory. On the bottom is displayed the number
 of subdirectories and files in this directory, available diskspace in
 kilobytes and the amount of bytes in the files. There are also some
 arrow-gadgets (top, bottom, page/row up/down). With them you can scroll
 the directories on screen if they are too long to fit in one page.
  You can enter a subdirectory by clicking mouse on its name on the left
 side. After this the FIRST-gadget will bring back the first directory.
 You can exit Dir by clicking the window's close-gadget.
  '@{i}.fastdir@{ui}' option uses '.fastdir' file if one is found. This is an old
 invention used at least by 'CLI-Mate' program but I decided to include it
 anyway. The directory is stored in a file and it loads faster than normal
 directory. See @{" Special/Make.fastdir " link MAKEFASTDIR}!
 '@{i}TrackDir@{ui}' uses trackdisk to read the directory. This might be a bit
 faster than directory read by normal means at least with long directories
 under OFS and KickStart1.2/1.3. '@{i}Last Dir@{ui}' (memory dir) displays the last
 directory which was displayed on screen when exited. This will save time
 if you need the same directory many times.
@endnode

@node EXECUTE "Executing Commands"

@{b}Execute:@{ub}
  You can execute a DOS-command with this command the same way you would do
 it in CLI/Shell. This uses 'Run' command (which has to be available). A
 small window will be opened for possible text output.
@endnode

@node FILENOTE "Setting Comments On Files"

@{b}FileNote:@{ub}
  Allows you to set a comment on a file. These comments can be displayed
 with DOS's 'List' command. To remove the comment enter a blank comment.
 Wildcards (*,?) can be used.
@endnode

@node TYPE "Typing ASCII Text"

@{b}Type:@{ub}
  Displays ASCII file. Just enter the file name. If the file is powerpacked
 it will be decrunched provided that powerpacker.library is found in your
 LIBS: (and reqtools.library for the password, if the file is crypted).
 If not, the file will be displayed as normal ASCII and it may look a bit
 strange. You can scroll the text in the window with the arrow-gadgets.
 Press the window's close-gadget to exit.
@endnode

@node SETCLOCK "Setting Battery Backed Up Clock"

@{b}SetClock:@{ub}
  '@{i}Reset@{ui}' will reset the battery backed up clock. Use this if your Amiga
 does not recognise the clock while SetClocking in DOS.

  '@{i}Load@{ui}' loads the current time from the clock and sets the system time.

  '@{i}Save@{ui}' asks you to enter the current date and time as DD-MM-YY HH:MM:SS
 and saves them in the clock.
 (e.g. 26-09-92 22:08:02 or 26-9-92 22:8:2)
@endnode

@node DISK "The Disk Menu"

@{b}Disk:@{ub}
  This menu contains the commands that are used to manipulate floppy disks.
@endnode

@node RELABEL "Changing Disk Label"

@{b}ReLabel:@{ub}
 Changes disk's name. First enter the drive where the disk is and then the
 new name for the disk.
@endnode

@node INSTALL "Installing Disks"

@{b}Install:@{ub}
  Just enter the drive to be installed. This command installs a normal DOS-
 boot. '@{i}NoBoot@{ui}' removes the boot. If '@{i}FFS@{ui}' is selected the boot will be in
 FastFileSystem format to be used with KickStart2.x+.
@endnode

@node FORMAT "Formatting Disks"

@{b}Format:@{ub}
  Enter the drive to be formatted and a name for the disk. '@{i}Quick@{ui}' option
 initializes only the boot and root blocks. '@{i}Verify@{ui}' determines if the
 format will be verified. If '@{i}Install@{ui}' is selected, the disk will be
 installed with normal DOS-boot after the format. '@{i}FFS@{ui}' uses FastFileSystem
 format. '@{i}MarkBADD@{ui}' works like a program called 'BADFormat'. If it finds
 damaged blocks, they will be marked as used. Then those bad blocks won't
 cause any read/write errors but you can still use the 'healthy' parts of
 the disk. See @{" Preferences/MarkBADD " link MARKBADD}!
@endnode

@node DISKCOPY "Copying Disks"

@{b}DiskCopy:@{ub}
  Copies a whole disk to another disk. Enter the source and destination
 drives. You can use one or two drives. If you use only one drive you may
 have to change disks several times. This depends on the amount of free
 memory. PopHelp copies as much data into memory as possible (PH tries to
 preserve at least 50K of memory available so that your system has
 something to multitask in) and asks you to change disks after that.
  '@{i}Verify@{ui}' determines if the copy is verified. You can't have two identical
 disks in the drives at the same time. If '@{i}Date@{ui}' is selected, the
 destination disk's creation and last modification dates will be modified.
 This makes the disks look different so that AmigaDOS can separate them.
 If I remember right, KickStarts1.2/1.3 have a bug, so this won't normally
 help. TrackSalve tries to do something about it, so use it.
 In KickStart2.x and higher 'Date' should have the required effect.
@endnode

@node SPECIAL "The Special Menu"

@{b}Special:@{ub}
  This menu contains some  not so often used -specialities.
@endnode

@node VECTORS "Strategic Vectors"

@{b}Vectors:@{ub}
  This menu displays some strategic vectors. The reset vectors should
 normally be zero. Hope you do not have any viruses!
@endnode

@node MAKEFASTDIR "Creating .fastdir Files"

@{b}Make .fastdir:@{ub}
  This command creates a '.fastdir' file in the specified directory. The
 '.fastdir' file is identical to files created with a program called
 'CLI-Mate'. See @{" Commands/Dir " link DIR}!
@endnode

@node SHOWGFX "Displaying Graphics"

@{b}ShowGfx:@{ub}
  View graphics. You can show IFF ILBM files and workbench icon (.info)
 files. If the shown icon has two images, you can toggle between them by
 pressing Return. PopHelp needs 'icon.library' to view icons.
 Powerpacked ILBM files supported.
@endnode

@node PREFERENCES "The Preferences Menu"

@{b}Preferences:@{ub}
  This menu controls some settings that determine how PopHelp works.
@endnode

@node COPYBUFFER "The Size Of CopyBuffer"

@{b}CopyBuffer:@{ub}
  This affects the size of the buffer used by the Copy and Move commands.
 '@{i}AutoSize@{ui}' allocates a buffer according to the file size, so that the copy
 can always be done in one part.
  '@{i}SetSize@{ui}' allows you to set a fixed size to the buffer by typing it in
 kilobytes from the keyboard. After that this size will be used for every
 file. For example, if you want to copy a 50K long file and you use
 AutoSize, the buffer size will automatically be adjusted to 50kb. If you
 use SetSize and set the buffer to 50K the file can also be copied in one
 part. However, if you set the buffer size to 32K the file must be copied
 in two parts. (If PH fails to allocate the AutoSized buffer it tries to
 allocate the SetSized buffer!)
  Note that the memory for the buffer is allocated only when the Copy and
 Move commands are used. Otherwise it is free to be used by other programs.
@endnode

@node SCREENMODE "Setting Window Max Size"

@{b}ScreenMode:@{ub}
  Select @{i}PAL@{ui} or @{i}NTSC@{ui} size. When PopHelp opens other windows, like in Dir
 and Type, you can have a window that covers the whole screen (more text!)
 if you have a PAL Amiga. You can not select PAL if your Amiga is in NTSC
 mode.
@endnode

@node BORDERS "Border Colors"

@{b}Borders:@{ub}
  This affects the outlook of the 3D-things. KickStarts1.2/1.3 and 2.x+
 have usually white and black colours swapped, so this helps the borders
 not to look strange. Pick up the one you like the best!
@endnode

@node MARKBADD "Marking Bad Blocks"

@{b}MarkBADD:@{ub}
  When you use the 'MarkBADD' option in @{" Format " link FORMAT}, bad blocks are marked as
 used so that they will not be used by DOS. However, AmigaDOS usually reads
 and writes only full tracks at a time. If we mark only couple of blocks in
 a track used, also those blocks will be read and written anyway every time
 the track is used and they will cause trouble. So, in this case it is no
 use marking  only  those couple of blocks.  If we want to have some
 advantage, we have to mark the whole track.
  There is also the 'old' option which marks only blocks but you should use
 the option that marks whole tracks. (There are 80 cylinders on a disk
 (0-79), a cylinder consists of 2 tracks, one on each side of the disk and
 a track consists of 11 blocks.)
@endnode

@node PHPOINTER "Mouse Pointer Style"

@{b}PHPointer:@{ub}
  Use PopHelp's built-in pointer. This pointer is displayed when PopHelp
 window is active and it is currently the normal KickStart2.x+ pointer.
 When PopHelp does something for longer time or is waiting for a response,
 the pointer will be usually changed to KickStart2.x+ style clock, even if
 this option is not enabled.
@endnode

@node SAVEPREFS "Saving Preferences"

@{b}SavePrefs:@{ub}
  Saves the current preferences settings to a file called 'S:PH.prefs'.
 When PopHelp is run, it checks for this file and sets the preferences
 according to the file.
@endnode

 English. If you have any problems, suggestions, bug reports, donations
