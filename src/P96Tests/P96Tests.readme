Short:        P96 Test programs
Author:       jens@icomp.de (iComp)
Uploader:     thomas richter alumni tu-berlin de (Thomas Richter)
Type:         dev/src
Version:      1.1
Requires:     P96 >= 2.1.0
Architecture: generic

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This archive contains various test programs that may serve useful
when developing P96 drivers. They run though multiple graphics
primitivities implemented both by the rtg.library of P96 and the
corresponding hardware driver.

Note that the implementations of these tests are "quick and dirty"
and should not be used as a basis for productive software. Their
sole purpose is to test P96 and its drivers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

New in release 1.1:

- This version includes the prototypes and pragmas for the
  rtg.library. Note that the rtg.library is *not* a public
  interface of P96 and application programs should not depend
  on this library, but rather go through Picasso96API.library.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

New in release 1.0:

- This is the first Aminet release.
