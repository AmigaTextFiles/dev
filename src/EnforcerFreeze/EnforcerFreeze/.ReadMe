"EnforcerFreeze.lha"


Description:

    This archive contains one more or less useful small
    CLI program with complete source.

    It is an _experimental_ program to halt 'EnforcerHitting'
    Processes.

    It has one bad limitation, that it can (currently)
    not immediatley halt a hitting proocess, but instead
    has to wait up to the next process switch 8-(((


Notes:

    * please note that it is possible to get the commandtemplate
    of each of the commands by calling something like
	> strings <cmdname> | search "*$ARG:"
    without invoking it w/ '?' (but that is also possible)
    (pipe is part of '2.04hacks' or builtin for some shells;
    strings is part of the archive (or again part of some
    shells))


History:

    Please have a look into ".History"


Compilation:

    * The .c sources do compile with SAS/C v6.51 (SCOptions &
    SMakefile are part of the archive). The files may also
    compile w/ DICE, but I won't guarantee for that.
