            LanguageGUI V3.00 - By: John White - PUBLIC DOMAIN.
           -----------------------------------------------------
@{fg text}
 LanguageGUI (LGUI) is a Graphical User Interface for `Speaking' Languages
 such as GERMAN, FRENCH, ITALIAN, SPANISH, TAGALOG (Philippines), etc. It
 has, hopefully, been designed to make your life a little bit easier when
 learning a `Speaking' language.

 LGUI needs at least Operating System 39 and ¾ to 2Mb to work.

@{fg shine}
 General Information@{fg text}

 * About 99% of Memory is allocated only when it is needed and deleted
   as soon as it is no longer needed. Fast Ram will be used where possible.
@{fg fill}
 The Speech Memory will only be set-up if the Speech File is Loaded. If an
 error occurs whilst loading the file (I.e it is not of the correct Format)
 LGUI will delete the speech memory. Thus, no memory wastage.@{fg text}

 * LGUI (including the LGUI disk contents) is about 99% finished - LGUI may
   need little things doing to it.

 * Most functions can use a Keyboard Key, aswell Mouse_Key/s, and are high-
   lighted with a White character. Here is a list of those keyboard keys
   NOT highlighted with a White character....

      Main Screen:   Left-Shift and ESC  =  Quit LGUI.

                   NumerPad Up and Down  =  Move up/down (display) one item.


   Options Screen:    F1 to F10 and DEL  =  Hightlight the left categories.

                      F1 to F10 and DEL  =  Hightlight the right categories.
                      (with Left-Shift)

                     Left-Shift and ESC  =  Quit LGUI.

 * A1200 owners, etc should use a PAL-HIRES ScreenMode as opposed to one of
   the AGA Multiscan ScreenModes (DblPal, etc).

 * Advanced Amiga Basic (by Compute! books) is worth reading as it has a few
   pages covering Amiga Phonetic Speech - pages 168 to 171 if I remember.

 * LGUI was released to give you a G.U.I for your Speaking Languages. Please
   do not think it should have Languages released with it because it does
   not. TAGALOG was supplied purely as an example as to how you should
   construct your language files for LGUI use.

   The aim of the language files is that once you have decided to learn a
   language, wether that is because you are going on Holiday or because you
   are a Student of some sort or whatever, you make your language files to
   contain only those Words/Sentences that you will be needing and/or
   learning. For example. Your holiday language files might only contain
   common words and sentences, to get you by whilst on holiday. Whereas
   your student language files might contain 1000+ words and sentences, as
   you are trying to learn that language.
@{fg shine}
 Warning@{fg text}

 Because I do not know everything about the Amiga and its Speech, I will not
 take any responsibility for Speech Functions if they make your Amiga Crash
 and/or if they Damage, etc your Amiga system.

 Because I cannot trap every Error, I will not take any responsibility for
 the Loss or Damage of any Data, etc caused by any of the programs/files on
 the LGUI disk/s.

 I will not take any responsibility for any Damage of Hardware or Software,
 etc caused by any of the programs/files on the LGUI disk/s.

@node Why "So Why Learn A Language?"
@{fg shine}
 LIKE ANY LANGUAGE, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT YOU MAY GAIN FROM LEARNING IT.
@{fg text}
 *  The ability to speak to Foreign people. Thus, make New Friends, be
    invited to (even more) Parties!, Chat-Up the opposite/same sex
    (We are in the year 2001!), etc.

 *  The ability to speak the language of the country you are visiting.

 *  The ability to get a Job in a foreign country.

 *  Be able to talk about something in a foreign language without your
    own speaking language people knowing what you are talking about.
@{fg shine}
 SOME REASONS FOR WANTING/NEEDING TO LEARN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.
@{fg text}
 *  So that you can enjoy yourself on holiday with the Local people.

 *  So that you can talk to Hotel Staff (If there is a problem with your
    Hotel Room, etc) or an Emergency Crew (If you end up in Hospital, etc)
    whilst on Holiday.

 *  Perhaps your New Partner does not speak your own language that well?
    If so. Instead of leaving your partner to learn your language you could
    always learn each others language. Learning can be Fun. Especially when
    it comes to learning what each Body Part is called!!

 *  Job Opportunities.
@{fg shine}
 TWO GOOD REASONS/ADVANTAGES FOR LEARNING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE ARE:
@{fg text}
 1) Most people are surprised you can talk their language and thus tend to
    show more interest in you.

 2) You are showing people you are willing to Learn, Communicate, Make An
    Effort, etc.

 @{" One Method Of Learning " Link "Method"}
@endnode

@node Method "One Method Of Learning"

 1) Try and learn the Basic Words first. Like @{fg shine}Why@{fg text},@{fg shine} Who@{fg text},@{fg shine} What@{fg text},@{fg shine} Where@{fg text},@{fg shine} You@{fg text},
    @{fg shine}I@{fg text},@{fg shine} Me@{fg text},@{fg shine} Her@{fg text} and so on.

 2) Listen to your foreign friends when they speak to each other - Try and
    see if you can identify any of the words you have learnt. You should
    begin to reckonize, by the tone of voices and body-language, whether or
    not someone is Asking a question (Why, What, etc), Talking about someone
    (He, They, etc) or whatever. By doing this early on you should gain some
    Hearing as to expressing yourself (Tone of voice, Loudness, etc).

 3) Once you have learnt about 100 Basic Words (or about 150 Assorted Words)
    learn some Basic Sentences, Comments, etc. Like @{fg shine}Hello@{fg text},@{fg shine} Good Afternoon@{fg text},
    @{fg shine}How Are You@{fg text},@{fg shine} The Weather Is Bad@{fg text}, etc.
@{fg fill}
    Learn the Words first. If you learn the Sentences first you will be
    flickering through a Dictionary, most of the time, looking up word
    meanings. This may seem an obvious point but it is an easy point to
    forget when you are eager to learn a language via its sentences first.@{fg text}

 4) At this stage keep your words and sentences simple, as above. Keep
    repeating steps 1-3 until you can comfortably remember about 50 words
    and about 20 short sentences - The reason I say this is because if you
    learn too many words/sentences at this stage you may forget some of them
    later. Especially if they are words/sentences that look useful at the
    time but are not used in every-day speech. This is why it is vital to
    carefully select your words and sentences.

 5) Try and join a few words together, to make small sentences, using the
    in-between words. [He]@{fg shine} Is A @{fg text}[Teacher], [She]@{fg shine} Is On The @{fg text}[Telephone],
    [They]@{fg shine} Are In The @{fg text}[Kitchen], etc. [] means the word is optional. By
    learning some of the in-between words early on you can begin to form
    your own small sentences, by simply replacing the optional words - If
    the language permits this.

 6) Keep repeating step 5 until you comfortably know quite a few short
    sentences - Even if those short sentences are only things like
    [I] Am A [Teacher], [She] Is A [Nurse], [TOM] Is In The [Garden],
    [The Food] Is On The [Table], It Is [Raining], etc.

 7) Now try and learn a few more short words and sentences.

 8) Now you know quite a few bits and pieces, try and learn Commands and
    Questions, etc. Like @{fg shine}[Where] is [TOM]?@{fg text},@{fg shine} [Wash] Your [Hands]@{fg text},@{fg shine} Wait There@{fg text},
    @{fg shine}[How Much] Is [This]?@{fg text}, @{fg shine}[Open] The [Window]@{fg text}, etc - They are Very Short,
    but effective.

 9) Keep repeating step 8, building up your sentences. You should find after
    a while, especially if you have been speaking (aswell as remembering)
    the above type of sentences, that things start to fall into place and
    you can remember sentences and words with a lot more ease, etc.

10) Now it is time to learn the Categories. Learn each category, slowly as
    above, until you can correctly remember and say about 95% of a category.
    You do not need to learn one category at a time. You could learn the
    same two categories each day, learning about 25% of each category, and
    then learn two different categories a week later for example. Thus,
    learning a bit of each category over a period of a few weeks/months.
@{fg fill}
    The above sentences, etc are only examples. The above method is loosely
    based on the way I started to learn TAGALOG.@{fg text}

 @{" Tips " Link "Tips"}
@endnode

@node Tips "Tips"

 * Try and be around a friend who speaks the language you are learning.
@{fg fill}
   Ask that friend if they are "Slanging" their Words and Sentences. If they
   are, ask them how to say things in a more "Proper/Standard" way. Do not
   ask that friend too much in one day as they might get a bit irretated. An
   example of this is to ask dictionary type questions:@{fg shine}
   Why do you say "So And So" in one sentence and say "So And So" in another
   when both sentences are the same?"@{fg fill}.@{fg shine} "Is that an Adjective or a Verb?"@{fg fill}.
   I fell into this trap. You have to realize that your friend is NOT Your
   Teacher and that they might only speak their language the same way as you
   speak yours (I.e They do not eat Dictionaries for Breakfast either!).@{fg text}

 * Read Newspapers and Kids Books, prefably with a foreign friend around
   to help you, if need be.
@{fg fill}
   Try to avoid reading items such as Foreign Comics, Foreign Newspapers and
   Foreign Magazines that comprise of two languages and are based in your
   own country. For example. If you read a Filipino Newspaper, based in
   England, the articles normally comprise of Tagalog and English. If the
   article writer is not fluent enough in both languages, which is normally
   the case, what tends to happen is the Tagalog gets English-ized. This may
   mean broken English, broken Tagalog, misinterpretation, lack of learning
   (because proper Tagalog words are substituted by incorrect translations),
   etc.@{fg text}

 * Listen to Music/Slow Worded Songs, The Radio/Slow Speaking Presenters,
   etc.

 * Do not Read, Write and/or Translate everything Literally.

 * Try and make a Tape for yourself with a few basic Sentences, etc on it.
   So that you can go Jogging for example and learn your foreign language at
   the same time.

 * Do not keep putting off your learning. When you have nothing to do, or if
   you are bored, or if there is nothing on Television, etc why not switch
   on your Tape, as above, and learn some more.

 * Some days just listen to your foreign friends talking to each other and
   try to translate what they are saying.

@node Starting "Getting Started"

@{fg shine} From the Startup-Sequence@{fg text}

 Put LGUI into the C drawer, of the floppy disk or hard drive you are going
 to boot with. To run LGUI simply re-boot your amiga. If you try and boot
 from a floppy drive when you have an hard drive the hard drive will have
 priority over the floppy drive. If you only have floppy drives or only have
 a hard drive then LGUI will boot as normal.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From CLI@{fg text}

 Put LGUI anywhere you please. In your C drawer, Tools drawer or where ever.
 Start a CLI Process (I.e use CLI, Shell or Workbench's `Execute' menu) and
 type the pathname for LGUI (I.e DF1:Tools/LGUI, LGUI, etc) and then press
 ENTER. This will run LGUI. Alternatively. Type the pathname for LGUI
 followed by one or more CLI Arguments and then press ENTER.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From Workbench@{fg text}

 Make sure there is a TOOL Icon on LGUI and then double-click on LGUI. This
 will run LGUI, which will then read the TOOL Icon for LGUI ToolTypes. If it
 finds any it will set the appropriate values inside LGUI.

 @{" ToolTypes    " Link "ToolTypes"}
@endnode

@node Arguments "CLI Arguments"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of LGUI CLI Keywords with their Arguments. LGUI will not
 interpret an argument if its keyword is missing. I.e You cannot just type
 the argument WORK: without typing the keyword DEVICE_LOADFROM for example
 as other keywords might use a WORK: argument. Thus, LGUI would have an hard
 time differentiating everything.

 You can use more than one keyword/argument set. Example:

 LGUI DEVICE_LOADFROM WORK: WORKBENCH_CLOSE YES

 Keywords and Arguments must be UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing in
 uppercase LGUI does not get clogged up with conversion code, opening of
 the Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} CLI Arguments@{fg text}

 SPEECH_PRIORITY Number

 The number can be from 0 upto 255. The default is 100. Using an high number
 (past 100) means most programs will get locked out (will not run) whilst
 your speech is being spoken. Whereas a low number (under 100) means Audio
 breaks might occur in your speech.


 DEVICE_LOADFROM DeviceName tells LGUI which device to use, with the drawer
 LanguageGUI, for Loading operations. For example. LGUI DEVICE_LOADFROM DF0:
 tells LGUI that your Language Files should be found in the drawer
 DF0:LanguageGUI.

 DEVICE_SAVETO DeviceName tells LGUI which device to use, with the drawer
 LanguageGUI, for Saving operations. For example. LGUI DEVICE_SAVETO DF0:
 tells LGUI that the Configuration File is to be saved in the drawer
 DF0:LanguageGUI.

 DeviceName can be:

       DH0:  DH1:  DH2:  DH3:  WORK: or LGUI:   Hard Drive Device/Partition.

                     DF0:  DF1:  DF2: or DF3:   Floppy Drives.


 WORKBENCH_CLOSE YES tells LGUI to try and Close (shut down) Workbench. In
 certain cases Workbench might not get closed (usually because another
 program is using Workbench, etc) hence the reason I said "Try and Close".
 Refer to an AmigaDos book or similar for more information on the
 CloseWorkbench() function.

 You can, as mentioned, enter more than one CLI Argument:

 LGUI DEVICE_LOADFROM DF0: DEVICE_SAVETO DF1: WORKBENCH_CLOSE YES

@{fg fill} Default values are used when a CLI Argument is not used/entered. RAM: is
 the default value for DeviceName, although it is not recommended. I only
 use RAM: for small files and for programming purposes. NO is the default
 value for WORKBENCH_CLOSE.@{fg text}
@endnode

@node ToolTypes "WorkBench ToolTypes"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of LGUI WB ToolTypes with their Arguments. LGUI will not
 interpret an argument if its tooltype is missing. I.e You cannot just use
 the argument WORK: without using the tooltype DEVICE_LOADFROM for example
 as other tooltypes might use a WORK: argument. Thus, LGUI would have an
 hard time differentiating everything.

 Tooltypes and Arguments must be in UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing in
 uppercase LGUI does not get clogged up with conversion code, opening of the
 Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} WB ToolTypes@{fg text}

 SPEECH_PRIORITY=Number

 The number can be from 0 upto 255. The default is 100. Using an high number
 (past 100) means most programs will get locked out (will not run) whilst
 your speech is being spoken. Whereas a low number (under 100) means Audio
 breaks might occur in your speech.


 DEVICE_LOADFROM=DeviceName tells LGUI which device to use, with the drawer
 LanguageGUI, for Loading operations. For example. LGUI DEVICE_LOADFROM DF0:
 tells LGUI that your Language Files should be found in the drawer
 DF0:LanguageGUI.

 DEVICE_SAVETO=DeviceName tells LGUI which device to use, with the drawer
 LanguageGUI, for Saving operations. For example. LGUI DEVICE_SAVETO DF0:
 tells LGUI that the Configuration File is to be saved in the drawer
 DF0:LanguageGUI.

@node Files "Files"

 With regards to the Language side of things, you have two sets of ASCII
 files. One set are known as the Default Files because they contain your
 own, Default, speaking language. For example, if you are English the
 Default Files should be written in the English. The other set of files
 are known as the Foreign Files because they contain the, Foreign, speaking
 language that you are learning. For example, if you are learning French the
 Foreign Files should be written in French.

 The idea of LGUI is to allow you to learn a Foreign Language, with the
 Words and Sentences as defined in the above files, with as much ease as
 possible by giving you a G.U.I that has basic Testing functions, aswell
 as Speech functions. Thus, you could be Reading, Writing and/or Speaking
 Foreign Words/Sentences within a short space of time (depending on your
 learning capabilities, etc).

 LGUI starts by looking for the file `DeviceName:LanguageGUI/LGUI.Config'.
 If it is not found, default configuration values are used.

 Make sure you have the LanguageGUI drawer on your DeviceName.

 The next file LGUI looks for is `DeviceName:LanguageGUI/Titles.Lgui'.
 If it is not found, default titles are used instead.

 The Language files are looked for next. If a language file cannot be found,
 LGUI will tell you the name of that file and then show you the Quit button!

 Once the above files have been successfully loaded LGUI then looks for the
 two, optional, speech files. Namely `DeviceName:LanguageGUI/FNSpeech.Lgui'
 and `DeviceName:LanguageGUI/FSSpeech.Lgui'. If a Speech file cannot be
 found or something is wrong with it (I.e the Format is incorrect), speech
 will not be available for that Catagory. So if something goes wrong with
 the `FNSpeech.Lgui' file, but not with the `FSSpeech.Lgui' file, speech
 will not be available for the Foreign Nouns but will be available for the
 Foreign Sentences.

 The Narrator.Device and Translator.Library are only used when you press the
 SPEAK button in LGUI. Thus, you could have bigger files on DF0: for example
 (because space would not be needed for the Narrator.Device and Translator-
 .Library upon startup) and then use speech later by Assigning the Devs/ and
 Libs/ drawers to another disk.

 Press ENTER/RETURN after each line (to give each line an EOL code), as
 described above. The above speech file would have the following output:

 Speaking Word/Sentence 1:  HELLO

 Speaking Word/Sentence 4:  MORNING TOM

 Speaking Word/Sentence 9:  GOOD BYE TOM


 A Speaking Word/Sentence can have upto 25 Syllables Lines Assigned to it,
 provided you have 25 (or more) syllable lines in your speech file of
 course. You can have upto 1500 syllables lines in your speech file. So, if
 you had 1 word per syllable line, you could have 25 words in each Speaking
 Word/Sentence - from a choice of 1500 words.
@{fg fill}
 You can, like I did in the above example, not enter a Speaking
 Word/Sentence into your speech file if you wish. I.e You do not have to
 have speaking words/sentences 1 to 9 in your speech file. You could just
 have speaking words/sentences 1, 4 and 9 only like in my example.

 Each Speaking Word/Sentence must be assigned to valid syllable lines.
 For example. You cannot have six syllable lines and then assign speaking
 word/sentence number one to syllable line 399, thinking that LGUI will use
 a Default Value in this case - LGUI will not and does not use Default
 Values with regards to syllable lines.

 When LGUI comes across a syllable line with Language Text inside it it
 Translates that syllable line's Language Text into Phonetic Text first
 before anything is spoken. You can speed this process up by converting
 your speech files to contain Phonetic Text syllable lines and change any
 % markers into # markers. Read the File_Checker.Guide for more information.
 The # marker tells LGUI that the Speaking Word (or Speaking Sentence) to be
 activated is already in Phonetic Text format. Thus, no need to Translate.
 All phonetic text syllable lines must contain Phonemes - They cannot
 contain both language text and phonetic text.

 The above formats are not Idiot Proof. I cannot make LGUI check your files
 thoroughly without clogging LGUI with Error Requests/ers. Thus, use the
 above formats as above and you should not have any problems?

 * Both Sentence files have to be of the same size. Also, all the Word files
   have to be of the same size as one another.

 * The Word files and the Sentence files are not related - The words found
   in the Sentence files come from the Sentence files and not from any of
   the Word files.

 * LGUI is set up for 1,500 Speaking Words and 1,500 Speaking Sentences.
   If you have more words (or sentences) than this then, of course, you will
   not be able to have a Speaking Word (or Speaking Sentence) for each of
   your words (or sentences).

 * LGUI Speech is meant for your Foreign Language only. The reason why there
   is no Default Language speech is because it is expected you can speak the
   default language or at least know it well enough not to need speech for
   it. I acknowledge there are cases where the default language is your
   second national language, for example, and you may not be too well up on
   it. But LGUI is firstly for the default language to be your own, first,
   national language (your speaking tongue).

 LGUI Speech is meant to be chopped into Syllables for the simple reason
 that LGUI is meant for teaching purposes (I.e The User has a chance to
 understand Each and Every Word/Sentence syllable by syllable as opposed
 to a foreign word/sentence sounding like it is coming at you at 100Mph).

           When using this function, to get back to Manual Mode from
           Automatic Mode, you only need to press or click the AUTO button
           once and then wait for the current item/s to be displayed before
           Manual Mode comes back into effect.@{fg shine}

 BUTTONS  @{fg text} The Brown/Yellow Off/On Buttons allow you to choose which items
           (Word, Sentence, Pro/Noun, Adjective and Ad/Verb) are to be
           shown. Any items that are Switched OFF (Brown) can be shown later
           with the REVEAL function (Manual Mode) or will be shown after a
           <Delay Rate> (Automatic Mode).

           * Manual Mode only. See REVEAL below.
@{fg shine}
    NEXT  @{fg text} Displays the next Word/s (or next Sentence/s).

           * Manual Mode only.
@{fg shine}
  REVEAL  @{fg text} Reveals any Word/s (or Sentence/s) that were not displayed by the
           NEXT function, above. The normal thing to do is set up LGUI, via
           the Brown/Yellow Toggle Buttons above, so that NEXT displays your
           Default Word/s (or Default Sentence/s) and REVEAL displays your
           Foreign Word/s (or Default Sentence/s).

           * Manual Mode only.
@{fg shine}
   SPEAK  @{fg text} Speaks the current Foreign Word (or Sentence), if the current
           Foreign Word (or Sentence) is Speakable.

           * Manual and Automatic Modes.
@{fg shine}
   PAUSE  @{fg text} Pauses LGUI for <Pause Rate> time. If the <Pause Rate> is Zero
           LGUI will pause until you press the Right-Mouse-Button

           * Automatic Mode only.
@{fg shine}
    DOWN  @{fg text} The Down-Cursor Key, on the NumericPad, is used to view the
           previous item/s. The two main reasons for this are that you did
           not quite memorize/see an item (perhaps because your <Pause Rate>
           was not slow enough) or that you want to skip through those items
           you have learnt already.@{fg text}

           * Manual Mode only. Speech can be used.
@{fg shine}
      UP  @{fg text} Same as above, but for viewing the next item/s.
@{fg fill}
           DOWN and UP reveal everything straight away, without Delays or
           Pauses. The NumericPad was used to save wear and tear on the

  D/F LINES@{fg text}  This is the Delay, for Sentences only, between Line 1
             (already shown) and Line 2 (to be shown after this Delay).
@{fg shine}
       AUTO@{fg text}  When all the Words (or Sentences) have been shown this Auto
             Delay will be used, before the next Words (or Sentences) are
             shown.
@{fg shine}
   SPELLING@{fg text}  Used with SPELL. This is the Delay between each Character
             appearing.
@{fg shine}
       WORD@{fg text}  Used with WORD-SPLIT. This is the Delay between each Word
             appearing.
@{fg shine}
     REVEAL@{fg text}  This is the Delay that occurs when either the Default item/s
             or the Foreign item/s have been switched off, but not when both
             items are off or on. For example. If you have the Default
             Sentences switched on and the Foreign Sentences switched off
             the Reveal Delay will occur when the Default Sentences have
             been shown. The Foreign Sentences will get shown after the
             Reveal Delay.

             * Works in Automatic Mode only.
@{fg shine}
 PAUSE RATE@{fg text}  The Pause Rate for the PAUSE function on the Main Screen.
@{fg fill}
 If you enter a value of 0 for any of the above delay/pause rates it means
 you do not require a delay/pause.

 You do not have to enter 3 numbers, for example, when you only need to
 enter 2 numbers (I.e you can enter 023 or simply 23). However. As my string
 update routine does not filter out leading zeros, the numbers will appear
 as 023 for example and not as 23. For now, I would stick to using 3 digits
 instead of 2 digits.
@{fg shine}
      VOICE@{fg text}  This selects the current Voice to use. The Voices are defined
             by STM V3. Both the STM and LGUI Configuration files have each
             others Default Configuration values inside them. To make a new
             configuration file that will work with both programs simply do
             the following:

             Define your Voice values with STM V3 and then save the
             configuration file as:  LGUI.Config

             When LGUI has loaded (with the above LGUI.Config file) define
             your Delays etc and then save the configuration file. It will
             be saved as LGUI.Config again. It can now be used with STM V3
             and LGUI, as it has the configuration values of both programs
             inside it.
@{fg shine}
 WORD SPLIT@{fg text}  Tells LGUI that you wish to split each Word line into three
             seperate Words, containing upto 14 Characters in each Word.
@{fg shine}
      SPELL@{fg text}  Tells LGUI that you wish to have every Word (or Sentence)
             spelt. It uses the SPELLING Delay to determine how long each
             character in a Word (or Sentence) is delayed for.
@{fg shine}
     SPEECH@{fg text}  Tells LGUI to switch Off/On speech.
@{fg shine}
     RANDOM@{fg text}  If this is ON it means you wish to learn your Word/s
             (or Sentence/s) RANDOMly, as opposed to IN ORDER.
@{fg shine}
  MISC. ALL@{fg text}  Miscellaneous All, when ON, tells LGUI that you would like the
             last category of a section (which should be named as either
             Miscellaneous Words or Miscellaneous Sentences) to include all
             the other categories of that section. This would allow you to
             learn each sentence, of each category, for example. If you are
             really Brave! use the RANDOM function aswell. MISC. ALL is for
             those people who have learnt about 80%+ of a Language and feel
             the need for a real test!

@node SWindow "The SEARCH Window"
@{fg shine}
 I will show you an example of SEARCH rather than try to explain it in
 detail.@{fg text}

 1) Select a Category from the Options Screen and then enter the Search
    Window.@{fg fill}

    The search will be isolated to look in this category only. The idea
    behind this isolation is for quick searching. For example. If the word
    you want to search for is KNIFE why search each category when you know
    that the word KNIFE would, more than likely, be in a `Kitchen' category
    and not in every category.@{fg text}

 2) If the word you are searching for is a WORD, you have the choice of
    selecting Pro/Noun, Adjective or Ad/Verb for the type of word to search
    and Default or Foreign for the type of Language. If the word you are
    searching for is a SENTENCE, you only have the choice of Default or
    Foreign for the type of Language. So, if you were to use the word KNIFE
    as a WORD you could select DEFAULT (because you do not know the Foreign
    equivalent of the word KNIFE) and PRO/NOUN (because you are using a
    Noun). If you were to use the word KNIFE as part of a SENTENCE you
    could select DEFAULT.

 3) Click in the Search String box or press `g' and enter the word KNIFE.
    The search will now search your category (hopefully `In The Kitchen'!)
    for the word KNIFE and display its Foreign equivalent if the word KNIFE
    was found. Thus, the above is how you find the foreign equivalent. If
    you know a Foreign word but not its Default equivalent you would choose
    FOREIGN and PRO/NOUN above for your search and then enter your foreign
    word in the Search String box.

    If a search is successful, press CONTINUE to try and find another valid
    search. If you are searching for a WORD, CONTINUE will try and find
    another WORD with KNIFE inside it. If you are searching for a SENTENCE,
    CONTINUE will try and find another SENTENCE with the word KNIFE inside
    it. Note: This paragraph is generalizing. SEARCH is more flexible than
    this. For example. You do not need to type in an whole word/sentence.
    Just one character, or more, is good enough (depending on what you are
    searching for of course).
@{fg fill}
    You can enter another (New) Search String by clicking inside the search
    string box again (or by pressing `g' again).

    Search is Case Sensitive and will accept characters from 32 to 255. Thus
    allowing for some Foreign characters, depending on your current KeyMap,
    etc.

    Because each Category is made into its own File String it means the
    search function might overlap into another category when it is to search
    from the last line of the current category. This will only happen if the
    search reaches the last line of a category, but normally (unless you are
    searching for `a' only or something) the search will not get to the last
    line. For example. If your last line was HOW MUCH IS THIS and you were
    searching for ZEBRA the search will not get to the last line because the
    last line does not contain the word ZEBRA. However, if you were
    searching for HOW the search would reach the last line and display
    HOW MUCH IS THIS before continuing the search for another HOW word in
    the next category. This is the trade off for having each category made
    into its own file string. Another trade off is that because each file
    string is really a category Search has to be case sensitive - In other
    words, it would be pointless changing a file string into Uppercase
    just so that Search would become Non-Case Sensitive. This would also
    mean displaying words/sentences in Uppercase aswell.

@node Update "Update Information"
@{fg shine}
 * LGUI is now programmed in MC68020 Assembly. This means LGUI V3.00 is
   approximately 50k smaller than LGUI V2.21 (OS3) and about twice as fast.
   If you are using an A600 use LGUI V2.20 (it also works on an A1200 and
   was programmed using `Amiga E'). Note. I have now deleted the `Amiga E'
   source code for LGUI.

 * Speech is no longer pre-programmed. Now you define your Voices via the
   STM V3 program which means the voices come from the LGUI.Config file.
   See `The Prefs Window - VOICE'.

 * The SEARCH function is a bit more flexible than in V2.21 as it now allows
   you to search for either a WORD or a SENTENCE without the need to exit
   the search window. Note. In this version, V3.00, the search function
   might not display any/same message/s as in V2.21 due to lack of time
   for checking/testing the search function thoroughly.

 * When saving a LGUI.config file there is no notification message displayed
   due to lack of time and thought as to wether to flash the screen or put
   up a requester, etc.

 * Voice Values. Below are my voice values for Tagalog and German. Keep the
   default Amiga voice values (Read the `STM.Guide') and then make the
   following changes:

   Tagalog Changes:  Sex         Female
                     Pitch       115
                     Rate        165
                     Frequency   18900
                     Enthusiasm  40
                     A/C Values  2,2,2,2

   My Tagalog voice values are based around the MA word, AH sound.


    German Changes:  Pitch       105
                     Rate        145
                     Frequency   21900
                     Enthusiasm  40
                     A/C Values  2,2,2,2

   My German voice values are based around the WER word, VEER sound.
@{fg fill}
 Once you have found reasonable speech values for a language you should not
 need to change those values. For example. The idea of LGUI Speech is to
 have a clear voice so that you can hear the syllables/words of a language.
 In other words, if an Englishman says "Hello" and a Frenchman says "Hello",
 regardless of Accent, they should both have a clear voice. In the case of
 LGUI German for example I used values that reflected a clear voice, but at
 the same time a voice that could pronounce most of the german words in the
 german files. I based the voice on the german word Wer (Veer). If you use
 the Amiga's natuaral voice Veer does not sound correct. With the german
 voice I chose the sound is a lot better and much clearer. It is usually the
 case that a voice has to be programmed based on one particular sound or
 word. With Tagalog it was the Ah sound.@{fg shine}

 * LGUI has now been sent to America, Australia and around Europe. So far I
   have had positive replies from America, Australia, France and Sweden.
   Check out their P.D Libraries. This is because I could afford the £1, or
   so, postage to Australia for example. But I cannot afford £1, or so, all
   the time (I.e sending to 10 countries could mean me spending upto £10).
   The same goes for P.D Libraries - They cannot afford to write to every
   Author for their latest software. Thus, if you are interested in LGUI,
   please contact me first as I cannot guarantee your country having the
   latest version of the LGUI Disks.

 * To see the Filipino Flag, in its correct colours, on the LGUI icon
   do the following:

   1) Set up your Iprefs enviroment.

      See your Workbench Manual and/or Workbench disk for more details.

   2) Delete the necessary enviroment files (I.e. screenmode.prefs, etc)
      from your Env: drawer (which should of been set up to `Ram:Env/Sys')
      and replace those deleted Ram:Env/Sys enviroment files with the
      LGUI enviroment files.

      Once all the necessary enviroment files have been deleted and replaced
      with the LGUI enviroment files the Workbench should change to an 8
      Coloured Workbench, with the Filipino Flag colours.
