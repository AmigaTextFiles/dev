              File Checker V3.00 - By: John White - Public Domain.
             ------------------------------------------------------

@{fg text}
 File_Checker V3.00 is a small program that checks your LGUI Speech Files
 and LGUI Language Files for common mistakes - Not all mistakes though
 simply because of the nature of LGUI files being in ASCII format. Which
 means LGUI programs/files are not fool proof. Hence the need for a program
 such as this.

 File_Checker V3.00 needs at least Operating System 39 to work. If you
 are going to use the TRANSLATE ToolType/Keyword you will also need the
 Translator.Library (V37+).

 General Notes@{fg text}

 * You can redirect the Output from FILE_CHECKER to a file, so that you
   can use a text editor to Cut `N' Paste any Language Text that has been
   translated into Phonetic Text. For example:

     FILE_CHECKER DEVICE_LOADFROM WORK: TRANSLATE TRUE Ram:My_File

   The above would use the Keywords and their Arguments as expected and then
   put any translated Language Text, which would now be Phonetic Text, into
   the file Ram:My_File

 Warning@{fg text}

 Note: Because I do not know everything about the Amiga and its Speech, I
       will not take any responsibility for Speech Functions if they make
       your Amiga Crash and/or if they Damage, Etc your Amiga system.

 Note: Because I cannot trap every Error, I will not take any responsibility
       for the Loss or Damage of any Data, Etc caused by any of the programs
       on this disk.

 Note: I will not take any responsibility for any Damage of Hardware or
       Software, Etc caused by any of the programs on this disk.

@node Starting "Getting Started"

@{fg shine} From the Startup-Sequence@{fg text}

 Put FILE_CHECKER into the C drawer, of the floppy disk or hard drive you
 are going to boot with. To run FILE_CHECKER simply re-boot your amiga. If
 you try and boot from a floppy drive when you have an hard drive the hard
 drive will have priority over the floppy drive. If you only have floppy
 drives or only have a hard drive then FILE_CHECKER will boot as normal.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From CLI@{fg text}

 Put FILE_CHECKER anywhere you please. In your C drawer, Tools drawer or
 whereever. Start a CLI Process (I.e use CLI, Shell or Workbench's `Execute'
 menu) and type the pathname for FILE_CHECKER (I.e WORK:Tools/File_Checker,
 File_Checker, etc) and then press ENTER. This will run FILE_CHECKER.
 Alternatively. Type the pathname for FILE_CHECKER followed by one or more
 CLI Arguments and then press ENTER.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From Workbench@{fg text}

 Make sure there is a TOOL Icon on FILE_CHECKER and then double-click on
 FILE_CHECKER. This will run FILE_CHECKER, which will then read the TOOL
 Icon for FILE_CHECKER ToolTypes. If it finds any it will set the
 appropriate values inside FILE_CHECKER.

@node Arguments "CLI Arguments"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of FILE_CHECKER CLI Keywords with their Arguments.
 FILE_CHECKER will not interpret an argument if its keyword is missing. I.e.
 You cannot just type the argument TRUE without typing the keyword TRANSLATE
 for example as other keywords might use a TRUE argument. Thus, FILE_CHECKER
 would have an hard time differentiating everything.

 You can use more than one keyword/argument set. Example:

   FILE_CHECKER FILE_TYPENAME FSS RANGE 1500 TRANSLATE TRUE

 Keywords and Arguments must be UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing in
 uppercase FILE_CHECKER does not get clogged up with conversion code,
 opening of the Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} CLI Arguments@{fg text}

 DEVICE_LOADFROM DeviceName

 This tells FILE_CHECKER which device to use, with the drawer LanguageGUI,
 for Loading operations. For example. FILE_CHECKER DEVICE_LOADFROM DF0:
 tells FILE_CHECKER that your Language and Speech Files should be found in
 the drawer DF0:LanguageGUI.

 DeviceName can be:

       DH0:  DH1:  DH2:  DH3:  WORK: or LGUI:   Hard Drive Device/Partition.

                     DF0:  DF1:  DF2: or DF3:   Floppy Drives.


 FILE_TYPENAME Type

 Type can be:     DS - This will make the file to check be DSentences.Lgui

                  FS - This will make the file to check be FSentences.Lgui

                  DN - This will make the file to check be DNouns.Lgui

                  FN - This will make the file to check be FNouns.Lgui

                  DA - This will make the file to check be DAdjectives.Lgui

                  FA - This will make the file to check be FAdjectives.Lgui

                  DV - This will make the file to check be DVerbs.Lgui

                  FV - This will make the file to check be FVerbs.Lgui

                 FNS - This will make the file to check be FNSpeech.Lgui

                 FSS - This will make the file to check be FSSpeech.Lgui

              TITLES - This will make the file to check be Titles.Lgui

 If this argument is not used, or used but not with a valid Type, the file
 to check will be DSentence.Lgui by default.


 RANGE Number

 Number is the Syllable range, 1 to 1500, which represents the 1500
 sentences you can define - see the `LGUI.Guide'.


 TRANSLATE TRUE/FALSE

 Use TRANSLATE TRUE if you want your Language Text translated into Phonetic
 Text. The default is TRANSLATE FALSE which does no translating. Which means
 the Translator.Library is not needed unless TRANSLATE TRUE is used.

 Default values are used when a Keyword/Argument is not used/entered.@{fg fill}

@node ToolTypes "WorkBench ToolTypes"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of FILE_CHECKER WB ToolTypes with their Arguments.
 FILE_CHECKER will not interpret an argument if its tooltype is missing.
 I.e You cannot just use the argument TRUE without using the tooltype
 TRANSLATE for example as other tooltypes might use a TRUE argument.
 Thus, FILE_CHECKER would have an hard time differentiating everything.

 Tooltypes and Arguments must be in UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing
 in uppercase FILE_CHECKER does not get clogged up with conversion code,
 opening of the Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} WB ToolTypes@{fg text}

 DEVICE_LOADFROM=DeviceName

 This tells FILE_CHECKER which device to use, with the drawer LanguageGUI,
 for Loading operations. For example. FILE_CHECKER DEVICE_LOADFROM DF0:
 tells FILE_CHECKER that your Language and Speech Files should be found in
 the drawer DF0:LanguageGUI.

 DeviceName can be:

       DH0:  DH1:  DH2:  DH3:  WORK: or LGUI:   Hard Drive Device/Partition.

                     DF0:  DF1:  DF2: or DF3:   Floppy Drives.


 FILE_TYPENAME=Type

 Type can be:     DS - This will make the file to check be DSentences.Lgui

                  FS - This will make the file to check be FSentences.Lgui

                  DN - This will make the file to check be DNouns.Lgui

                  FN - This will make the file to check be FNouns.Lgui

                  DA - This will make the file to check be DAdjectives.Lgui

                  FA - This will make the file to check be FAdjectives.Lgui

                  DV - This will make the file to check be DVerbs.Lgui

                  FV - This will make the file to check be FVerbs.Lgui

                 FNS - This will make the file to check be FNSpeech.Lgui

                 FSS - This will make the file to check be FSSpeech.Lgui

              TITLES - This will make the file to check be Titles.Lgui

 If this argument is not used, or used but not with a valid Type, the file
 to check will be DSentence.Lgui by default.


 RANGE=Number

 TRANSLATE=TRUE/FALSE

 Use TRANSLATE=TRUE if you want your Language Text translated into Phonetic
 Text. The default is TRANSLATE=FALSE which does no translating. Which means

              I usually reply to all my Letters, but this depends on the

@node Update "Update Information"
@{fg shine}
 * FILE_CHECKER V3.00 has been updated to allow the use of more Devices
   (I.e DF2: DF3: LGUI: etc). The code is still in the `Amiga E' language
   as I find it more flexible than MC68020 Assembly when writing programs
   such as FILE_CHECKER.
