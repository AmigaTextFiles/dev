         Speech File Renumberer V3.00 - By: John White - Public Domain.
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

@{fg text}
 Speech File Renumberer V3.00 (SFR) is a small program that allows you to
 Decrease or Increase your `Speaking Words/Sentences to be Activated'
 (SWSTBA), within a certain range.

 Imagine you have completed SWSTBA from 1 to 900 but have since found out
 you have missed SWSTBA 600. Normally this would mean manually changing
 SWSTBA 600 to 900 into 601 to 901 so that you could make room for SWSTBA
 600. This scenario would not be nice to say the least. SFR was written to
 help with this problem. Please Note. At the moment SFR is very basic.

 SFR V3.00 needs at least Operating System 39 to work.

@node Starting "Getting Started"

@{fg shine} From the Startup-Sequence@{fg text}

 Put SFR into the C drawer, of the floppy disk or hard drive you are going
 to boot with. To run SFR simply re-boot your amiga. If you try and boot
 from a floppy drive when you have an hard drive the hard drive will have
 priority over the floppy drive. If you only have floppy drives or only have
 a hard drive then SFR will boot as normal.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From CLI@{fg text}

 Put SFR anywhere you please. In your C drawer, Tools drawer or where ever.
 Start a CLI Process (I.e use CLI, Shell or Workbench's `Execute' menu) and
 type the pathname for SFR (I.e WORK:Tools/SFR, SFR, etc) and then press
 ENTER. This will run SFR. Alternatively. Type the pathname for SFR followed
 by one or more CLI Arguments and then press ENTER.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From Workbench@{fg text}

 Make sure there is a TOOL Icon on SFR and then double-click on SFR. This
 will run SFR, which will then read the TOOL Icon for SFR ToolTypes. If it
 finds any it will set the appropriate values inside SFR.

@node Arguments "CLI Arguments"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of SFR CLI Keywords with their Arguments. SFR will not
 interpret an argument if its keyword is missing. I.e You cannot just type
 the argument 100 without typing the keyword RANGE_START for example as
 other keywords might use a 100 argument. Thus, SFR would have an hard time
 differentiating everything.

 You can use more than one keyword/argument set. Example:

   SFR FILE_TYPENAME FSS RANGE_START 2 RANGE_STOP 155

 Keywords and Arguments must be UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing in
 uppercase SFR does not get clogged up with conversion code, opening of
 the Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} CLI Arguments@{fg text}

 DEVICE_LOADFROM DeviceName

 This tells SFR which device to use, with the drawer LanguageGUI, for
 Loading operations. For example. SFR DEVICE_LOADFROM WORK: tells SFR
 that your Language and Speech Files should be found in the drawer
 WORK:LanguageGUI.

 DeviceName can be:

       DH0:  DH1:  DH2:  DH3:  WORK: or LGUI:   Hard Drive Device/Partition.

                     DF0:  DF1:  DF2: or DF3:   Floppy Drives.


 FILE_TYPENAME Type

 Type can be:    FNS - This will make the file to check be FNSpeech.Lgui

                 FSS - This will make the file to check be FSSpeech.Lgui

 If this argument is not used, or used but not with a valid Type, the file
 to check will be FNSpeech.Lgui by default.


 RANGE_START Number

 Number is the starting position of your range. If you are Decreasing,
 RANGE_START should be in the range of 2 upto 1499. If you are Increasing,
 RANGE_START should be in the range of 1 upto 1499.


 RANGE_STOP Number

 Number is the end position of your range. If you are Decreasing, RANGE_STOP
 should be in the range of 3 upto 1500. If you are Increasing, RANGE_STOP
 should be in the range of 2 upto 1500.


 INCREASE YES/NO

 Use INCREASE YES if you want to Increase and INCREASE NO if you want to
 Decrease.
@{fg fill}
 Default values are used when a Keyword/Argument is not used/entered.@{fg fill}
@{fg shine}
 General Information@{fg text}

 * Your range does not have to be complete. For example. RANGE_START 1
   RANGE STOP 100 (a range of 100) Increase does not mean SWSTBA 1 to 100
   have to be in your speech file. Because SFR simply checks a SWSTBA to
   see if it is in your range, before increasing, you could just have
   SWSTBA 1, 3 and 77 for example. In this case SWSTBA 1, 3 and 77 would
   be increased to 2, 4 and 78 respectively.

   At the moment SFR only Increases or Decreases by 1. A future version
   would hopefully give you an option to increase or decrease by more.

 * Check for double SWSTBA values. For example. If your range was 1 to 2
   Increase and you had SWSTBA 1, 2 and 3. 1 would be increased to 2.
   2 would be Increased to 3. 3 would be left alone as it is not in your
   range. Thus, you would have SWSTBA values 1, 2 and 3 now as 2, 3 and 3.

   A future version would hopefully check for double values.

@node ToolTypes "WorkBench ToolTypes"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of SFR WB ToolTypes with their Arguments. SFR will not
 interpret an argument if its tooltype is missing. I.e You cannot just use
 the argument 100 without using the tooltype RANGE_START for example as
 other tooltypes might use a 100 argument. Thus, SFR would have an hard time
 differentiating everything.

 Tooltypes and Arguments must be in UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing
 in uppercase SFR does not get clogged up with conversion code, opening of
 the Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} WB ToolTypes@{fg text}

 DEVICE_LOADFROM=DeviceName

 DeviceName can be:

 FILE_TYPENAME=Type

 Type can be:    FNS - This will make the file to check be FNSpeech.Lgui

                 FSS - This will make the file to check be FSSpeech.Lgui

 If this argument is not used, or used but not with a valid Type, the file
 to check will be FNSpeech.Lgui by default.

 Use INCREASE=YES if you want to Increase and INCREASE=NO if you want to
 Decrease.

@node Update "Update Information"
@{fg shine}
 * SFR V3.00 has been updated to allow the use of more Devices (I.e DF2:
   DF3: LGUI: etc). The code is still in the `Amiga E' language as I find
   it more flexible than MC68020 Assembly when writing programs such as SFR.
