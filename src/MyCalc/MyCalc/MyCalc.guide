   A @{" GUI " LINK "TheGUI"} for calculating in Decimal/HexaDecimal.

   When the program Icon gets clicked on, nothing will happen until you
   press the @{" HOTKEY " LINK "ToolTypes"} defined in the Icon's ToolTypes array.
   Only then will the GUI appear & allow you to use the program.  This is
   because the Program appears as a@{BOLD Commodity} to the Amiga-OS.
      
   I wrote this program because I accidentally deleted Calc3.0 (& cannot
   find another copy), which performed/displayed calculations in 
   HexaDecimal, which is necessary sometimes when you're debugging a
   program.  Calc3.0 also did floating-point stuff as well (I miss it!).
   
  @{BOLD HISTORY}
       1.0 MyCalc is now working correctly!

   WARNING:  Expressions are internally limited to 256 characters. @{FG TEXT}
   
   You can enter an expression to evaluate in one of three ways:
   
   1. Click on the Expression String Gadget at the top of the display
      & type your expression into it (then press either <RETURN> or 
      <ENTER>).
 
   2. Activate the GUI & type from the keyboard any @{" keystrokes " LINK "VanillaKeys"} recognized
      by the program.  They will appear in the Expression String Gadget as
      you type them.

   3. Use the mouse to click on the various buttons to enter an
      expression into the String Gadget.

   The @{B}M in@{UB} Buttons simply place the last result present in
   the HexaDecimal display into the corresponding Memory Text Gadget.

   The @{B}M out@{UB} Buttons take the corresponding Memory Text Gadget
   contents & write them into the expression String Gadget.

   You get rid of the GUI by Clicking on the Close Window Gadget.
   
   NOTE:  The period (decimal) key is currently NOT operational.
          (Adding floating-point operations is left as an exercise 
          for the student(s)).

  @{FG SHINE}
  NOTE: @{FG TEXT} The following keys are recognized (but are NOT evident) by MyCalc:
          
         i,I - Just displays an Information requester about the program.

         ?,h,H - Displays this AmigaGuide file using Multiview.

         spacebar - Just adds white space to your expression.
                     
  @{SHINE "= "}Tells the program to evaluate the contents of the 
   expression String Gadget at the top of the display.  Unfortunately,
   this is the only way to perform evaluation from the keyboard.  The
   <RETURN> & <ENTER> keys are considered RawKeys & will NOT be 
   recognized by the GUI (Unless you're entering an expression directly
   into the Expression String Gadget).
  
  Only the following keystrokes will appear in the Expression String Gadget at
  the top of the Display:
  
  @{SHINE "0 through 9"}.
  @{SHINE "a through f"}. (Will be converted to uppercase)
  @{SHINE "A through F"}. (these are for HexaDecimal numbers)
              
  @{SHINE "$ "}Needed to differentiate HexaDecimal (base 16) numbers from
    Decimal (base 10). (Example: $7FFF is 32767 (base 10)).
  
  @{SHINE "+ - * / "}Basic Arithmetic operators.

  @{SHINE "% m or M "}Compute & return the remainder of two numbers.

  @{SHINE "< l or L "}Shift a number left by the number of bits given as 
   a second argument.

  @{SHINE "> r or R:"}Shift a number right by the number of bits given as 
   a second argument.

  @{SHINE "& "}Perform a Logical AND operation on two numbers.

  @{SHINE "| "}Perform a Logical OR operation on two numbers.

  @{SHINE "^ "}Perform a Logical XOR operation on two numbers.

  @{SHINE "~ "}Perform a Logical Bit inversion on a number following 
   this operator.

  @{SHINE "( or ) "}Group an expression, changing the precedence of
   operations.

   @{B}NOTE:@{UB}  The Close Window Gadget (or equivalent) only closes the window,
          it does not end the program because it's a Commodity.  This means
          you have to remove the program using @{B}Exchange@{UB} (usually located
          in Sys:Tools/Commodities/) or a similar program if you wish to end 
          the program completely.

  MyCalc was written using @{B}SAS-C V6.58@{UB}.

  The GUI was put together with GadToolsBox V37.300 (14.3.93) (C)
  1991-1993 by Jaba Development.  I wish that there was an easy way to pay
  for this godsend of a program (Thanx guys!).
