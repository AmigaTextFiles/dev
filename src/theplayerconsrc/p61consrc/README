I honestly thought I had released these sources ages ago already, but it
seems I didn't. Thanks to Robert Leffmann for bringing this to my
attention :) So here it is, hopefully still in compilable form.

Anyway, in case this is still useful to someone, I place it under
public domain, so feel free to use it as you wish.
