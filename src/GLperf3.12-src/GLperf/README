reference manual for GLperf, and includes a _short_ (probably too short)
tutorial.

Which Makefile?
---------------
For Unix based systems:
    make -f Makefile.unx

For WinNT, Win95:
    nmake /F Makefile.win

For OS/2:
    nmake /F Makefile.os2

Size and function selection
---------------------------
GLperf is a strange beast in that you can select how much functionality you
want to include in it at compile (build) time.  The more functions you
include, the bigger it gets (and it can get quite big!) so don't get
overenthusiastic!  You can specify which functions you want by defining
preprocessor variables in the Makefile.  These are the selectable functions:

    FULL_VERTEX_PATHS 
	By default, you can only use a "VertexDim" (or vertex dimension)
	of 3 (that is, you can only use glVertex3fv commands).   By defining
	this variable, you can enable the use of 2d vertices as well.

    FULL_RASTERPOS_PATHS 
	By default, you can only use a "RasterPosDim" (or rasterpos dimension)
	of 3 (that is, you can only use glRasterPos3fv commands).   By defining
	this variable, you can enable the use of 2d raster positions as well.

    FULL_COLOR_PATHS 
	By default, you can only use a "ColorDim" (or color dimension)
	of 3 (that is, you can only use glColor3fv commands).   By defining
	this variable, you can enable the use of RGBA data as well.

    FULL_TEXTURE_PATHS 
	By default, you can only use a "TexTarget" (or texture target)
	of GL_TEXTURE_2D (that is, you can only use 2d texture images and
	coordinates).   By defining this variable, you can enable the use of 
	GL_TEXTURE_1D (1d texture images) and even 3 or 4 dimensional textures
	if your OpenGL implementation supports the GL_EXT_texture3D or
	GL_SGIS_texture4D extensions respectively.

    FULL_UNROLL_PATHS
	By default, you cannot unroll calls in the inner traversal loop
	in GLperf.  Definition of this variable allows you to unroll up
	to 8 vertices in the inner loop, if possible.  Some primitives
	are not unrolled at all due to their relatively long execution
	times (PixelRects, TexImages, Bitmap, Text).

    FULL_FUNCPTR_PATHS
	Definition of this variable allows the user of GLperf to set
	"LoopFuncPtrs" (or loop function pointers) to "True".  Under
	this condition, all function calls in the inner loop will
	be made through function pointers.  This is faster on some 
	architectures.

As I hinted above, capricious definition of these variables can result
in an executable considerably larger than necessary.  You are therefore
admonished to set only the variables that you will need!  Enough said.

Here's a little data on the different IRIX sizes of GLperf, when compiled 
with optimization and then stripped of symbols.  As always, your sizes
may be more or less than these numbers (probably less if you're running
on a CISC processor like x86; about the same for most RISC processors).

lex and yacc dependency
-----------------------
For you non-Unix users, we have included the files generated from running
lex and yacc on the files Parse.l and Parse.y respectively.  This will
allow you to get by unless you want to modify those parsing files in some 
way (i.e. if you have masochistic proclivities).  If that is the case,
I'd recommend getting a freely available copy of flex and bison from 
the Free Software Foundation.  I won't list sites with these packages 
(just use any web search engine for sites), but you can contact the FSF at:
	Free Software Foundation, Inc.
	675 Massachusetts Ave.
	Cambridge, MA 02139
	(617) 876-3296

General notes for curious readers
---------------------------------
GLperf has a number of "generator" files that are all of the form *G.c
They are compiled by themselves into executables and then run.  They
will generate one or more files of the form *F.c  These *F.c files
#include *X.c files into them when they are compiled.  The *X.c files
can be thought of as templates, as they have tons of preprocessor directives
to make enumeration of traversal routines as general and easy as possible.

If you have suggestions, criticisms, comments or anything to say about
GLperf, its structure or Makefile(s), please drop me line at spit@sgi.com

Good luck!
