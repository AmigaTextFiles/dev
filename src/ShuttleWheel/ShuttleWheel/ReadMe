DESCRIPTION
 I wrote this source some years ago, it's based on dialgaget.c which
 can be found on the AmigaDeveloper CD. The idea for writing this class
 came from the famous cdda player JukeBox by F.J. Reichert. You are
 free to modify the source and to include it into your own programs. If 
 you do any changes to it, please email them to me. Thanks.


BUGS
 Yes, there are bugs. At least it seems to mess up the memory list sometimes
 :( I don't why 'cause wrote this program years ago, and didn't modify it
 for a long term. Feel free to fix them ;)
