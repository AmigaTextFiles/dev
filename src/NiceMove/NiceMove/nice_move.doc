3. What is it?
**************

If you are a programmer, you perhaps used the MOUSEMOVE events from
Intuition. In general there are no problems, but if you use a hires,
interlaced screen with 16 colors, it is somewhat useless because the
reaction is so very slow and your moving point runs after the mouse
pointer.

I tested a few different possibilities and commented them a bit. The
program nice_move offers you the chance to test 3 different handlers. You
can draw a line on a hires screen by pressing the LMB, moving the mouse and
then releasing the LMB. Close the window to quit.

nice_move runs on every Kickstart version and must be run from CLI/Shell.
It takes two arguments. The first is the handler, the second optionally
specifies the depth of the screen. The default is 4.
