NAME
   device_info -- Get information about a mounted DOS device.

DESCRIPTION
   This is a simple set of functions to obtain information about a
   mounted DOS device *by drive name*, not by device name and unit number.

   The main motivation has been that many programs expect the user to
   specify device and unit instead of simply the drive name. For example,
   instead of "cd0:" it has to be "scsi.device", unit 6.

   This is extremely tedious in most cases because nobody wants to keep
   SCSI-ID's in mind - not to mention that they might change.

   And why should one have to fiddle with several setups once a new serial
   card is installed and replace the string "serial.device" by
   "new-serial.device" in loads of settings windows? Let the user specify
   "SER:" and as time comes map "SER:" to a better device without the need
   to tell this every program.

   The only problem about that is that it is a bit annoying for
   programmers to collect this information together "manually". You have
   to lock the DosList, dig around in obscure data structures and fiddle
   with BCPL strings.

   These functions free you from this work. The device_info_t structure
   uses C strings and does not require any locking as everything is
   copied "by value" into the structure. No pointer references are used,
   so you can access the data even if the drive was ejected, unmounted
   or replaced. Of course this does not spare you a decent error handling,
   but you can be sure not to access any already released memory.

   For compiling this material, use the included makefile and possible
   additional files:

   smakefile, SCOPTIONS  - For SAS/c 6.57
   Makefile              - For gcc 2.7.2

   The code should also work with Dice C.

NAME
   device_info_t -- Device information data type.

FUNCTION
   The device_info_t stores information about a device.

SOURCE

    {
        STRPTR name;                /* Name, e.g. "PC0" (no colon!) */
        STRPTR handler;             /* Handler, e.g. "l:CrossDOSFileSystem" */

NAME
   free_device_info -- .

SYNOPSIS
   free_device_info( device_info )

   VOID free_device_info( device_info_t * );

FUNCTION
   Free resources allocated by get_device_info().

INPUTS
   device_info - Device information to free. This is the return value of
       get_device_info(). If this is NULL, the function will do nothing.

SEE ALSO
   get_device_info()

get_device_info

NAME
   get_device_info -- Get information about the given device..

SYNOPSIS
   device_info = get_device_info( name )

   device_info_t *get_device_info( STRPTR );

FUNCTION
   Get information about the given device.

   This is achieved by scanning the locking the DosList using
   LockDosList() and search for the device using FindDosEntry(). The
   resulting data are copied into own memory areas (by value) and no
   references to the original are kept. The DosList is then unlocked
   again.

   Some convenient translations are performed, e.g. BCPL strings are
   converted to zero terminated C strings and the block size is stored
   in bytes instead of longs.

   To give back these resources once they are not needed any more, you
   have to call free_device_info().

INPUTS
   name - Zero terminated device name, including trailing colon (:), for
          example "df0:".

RESULT
   If the information could be obtained, the full a full device_info_t
   is returned.

   In case of error, NULL is returned and IoErr() contains more
   information. Possible values are:
   
   ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE          - Not enough memory
   ERROR_INVALID_COMPONENT_NAME - 'name' did not end in ":"
   ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_MOUNTED     - Could not find any information about
                                  the requested device

NOTES
   Not all string fields of device_info-T have to contain values. For
   example, "df0:" does not have a handler but only a device, so
   device_info->handler is NULL.

   If device_info->device is NULL, most numeric fields are so. In such
   a case, device_info->unit is -1. This can happen for example with
   "Ram:".
