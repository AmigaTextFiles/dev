	This is an Example program on how to read joystick values 
quickly.  The system gameport.device is nice but it's not
ideally suited for grabbing joystick values in a hurry, as
is often done in arcade games, etc.  This function is less
friendly than using the gameport.device because it's designed
to be called from a loop, which may not be the best thing
to do in a multitasking situation.  Use this function with
caution as it does read the hardware directly.
This source can read from joysticks in either port
and understands the second fire button used on Sega
style joysticks.
