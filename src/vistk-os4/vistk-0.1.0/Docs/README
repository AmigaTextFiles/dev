	VisTk - the Visualize ToolKit library
	-------------------------------------

	(Not to be confused with *serious*
	projects with similar names or acronyms.
	VisTk used to be called "VTK", but I
	changed it for this public release to
	somewhat reduce the risk of confusion.)


In short, this is a widget toolkit originally designed
for svgalib in 256 color mode. I created it because I
needed something fast and simple to integrate simple
GUIs with fast real time visualization. Over time, it
has evolved a bit, but not much - it's been ported to
GGI and SDL, but still supports only 256 colors (needs
emulation provided by GGI or SDL, or the "real thing").

AFAIK, it won't build for GGI or svgalib any more -
the makefile doesn't check for them, but that's just
the beginning. OTOH, who needs that when SDL wraps
those and many more targets, adding lightning fast 256
color emulation? Works for me.

Either way, I'm not going to spend much more time with
this crap. The design is somewhat broken, and the code
could use a major overhaul. Don't use it for anything
serious, unless you seriously feel like making it "Yet
Another Toolkit"! I take no responsibility if you get
seriously ill or injured while trying to figure out if
you've found a bug or if you just don't understand how
VisTk is supposed to work.

Instead watch out for ChromeTk, if you're willing to
wait for something that

	1) is designed and hacked by me ("After
	   seeing THIS!? Yeah, right!" ;-)

	2) is designed specifically for flashy
	   GUIs with lots of chrome and high
	   quality rendering in games and
	   multimedia applications.

Otherwise, just use FLTK, GTK+, Qt or whatever - those
are well tested, solid, high quality software, and are
much more appropriate for common tasks than either my
VisTk or my upcoming ChromeTk.

Still, *if* you decide to play with VisTK, of course, I'll
gratefully accept patches - I'm still using VisTK in some
of my programs.
