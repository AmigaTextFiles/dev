New Features/Bugs:

 1.0 (6/20/93)      -First released to aminet.

 1.01 (6/23/93)     -Somehow I had forgotten to implement the underscore
                    gadget shortcuts. This is now fixed.

 1.02 (6/26/93)     -Blank string entries in a DropBox prefs file had
                    caused the loader to crash. Fixed this.

                    -It seems ICON_Y has no effect unless ICON_X is
                    present. I think this is a problem with AddAppIcon().

                    -Using Commodities to kill DropBox would cause the
                    message window to be orphaned. Now fixed.

                    -DropBox now detatches itself from the CLI.

                    -DropBox accepts a new tooltype TASK_PRI. This value
                    set's DropBox's task priority. Default is 0.

 1.1                -DropBox accepts a new tooltype APPMENU. This tells
                    DropBox whether or not to create a AppMenuItem.
                    Suggested by Lee Derringer.

                    -DropBox has a new pref file format. Don't worry, it
                    can read the old one, too (but not save it).

					 -DropBox supports two new commands in the command
                    template, [SOURCEDIR] and [SOURCEFILE].

                    -Up and Down buttons moved into Edit menu.

                    -When the DropBox message window was closed, I would
                    try to clean up a message port that didn't exist. This
                    is fixed. Bug found by Mike Hall and Franz Schwarz.

                    -DropBox now allows for more than one pattern per
                    DropItem. New editor.

                    -DropBox has an option Create to create a directory
                    in the destination and use that as the destination.

                    -DropBox has a menu option whether or not to save
                    icons for the created directories.

                    -DropBox no longer uses the Message window to notify
                    the user of errors. It never needed to.

					-The DropBox window was cleaned up and redesigned.
					
                    -The Input and Output checkboxes were merged into one
					box called I/O. I justify this because there is no real
					reason to have input without output and vice versa.

					-There was a nasty bug that would cause DropBox to fail
					under certain conditions when a command was executed
					from within DropBox. Fixed.

					-Now when DropBox finds multiple DropItems for a given
					file, it checks the state of a new option (in the
					options menu) Use Select Window. If this is set, DropBox
					will put up a window containing a listview of the
					applicable DropItems, and allow the user to choose the
                	one which will process the file. Otherwise, DropBox
                    chooses the first DropItem it finds.

                    -The I/O Window can now be sized and positioned. These
					attributes are saved in the prefs file.

                    -The Verify Commands option, when enabled, causes
					DropBox to parse the command template after the user
					enters it (if he or she hits return or tab). If it
					is invalid, a warning will pop up.

					-The entire parsing process was rewritten, and is now
					more stable.

					-Various minor bugs were fixed
