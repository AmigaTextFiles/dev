    NAME
	G_Arc -- draws an elliptical arc.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_Arc( a0:drawable, struct GC *a1:gc, LONG d0:x, LONG d1:y, ULONG d2:width, ULONG d3:height, LONG d4:ang1, LONG d5:ang2 );

    FUNCTION
	Draws an arc defined by an ellipse [(x/a)^2+(y/b)^2=1].  The
	size of the ellipse (a,b) is given by width and height.  And the
	origin is given by (x,y).  An incomplete arc can be produced
	by giving the two angles.  The value of 360 degrees is 
	given in the header file giraffe.h as G_2pi.  The
	thickness of the arc can be controled using gc.LineWidth.

    INPUTS
	drawable     -- either a bitmap or a layer.
	gc           -- user initialized graphics context.
	x,y          -- center of the ellipse.
	width,height -- size of the ellipse.
	ang1,ang2    -- angle swept by arc.

giraffe.library/G_BeginUpdate

    NAME
	G_BeginUpdate -- limits clipping to the damagelist.

    SYNOPSIS
	BOOL G_BeginUpdate( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Sets the layer visibility only to the internal damagelist
	for more efficient refreshing of a layer.  The damagelist
	is automatically cleared assuming that the layer is to
	be properly refreshed.
	  During this time, the layer is locked so that no other
	processes may interfere with the refresh.  When done call
	G_EndUpdate().
	  Because the layers without full clipping do not have 
	their own cliplist or damagelist for that matter, all 
	refreshes should begin with a full layer and then nest
	into their children.  If you begin refreshing just a 
	non-clipped layer, G_BeginUpdate() will return false 
	indicating that the cliplist has not been changed.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    RESULT
	result -- returns TRUE if damagelist was not empty.  NULL
	          means that the layer needs no refreshing.

giraffe.library/G_CloseFont

    NAME
	G_CloseFont -- release a font resource.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_CloseFont( Font a0:font );

    FUNCTION
	Decrements the internal user count of a font supplied by
	a call to openfont().  When this value reaches zero, then
	the font resources are destroyed.

    INPUTS
	font -- pointer returned by G_OpenFont()

    NOTES
	I can't guarantee that any of the font functions are
	working at this moment.

	G_OpenFont()

giraffe.library/G_CloseLayer

    NAME
	G_CloseLayer -- shuts down a layer from use.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_CloseLayer( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Closes all resources used by the layer for clipping.  This
	ends the users access to the layer.  The pointer remains valid
	until the internal
	usecount reaches zero (by G_DropLayer()).  It will then be removed
	from the layer tree.  During this time, its cliplist has
	been destroyed so that it cannot be mapped again.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

	G_OpenLayer(), G_DropLayer()

giraffe.library/G_CycleLayer

    NAME
	G_CycleLayer -- change the depth of a layer.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_CycleLayer( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Moves a layer within its sibling list.  If the layer is behind
	another, it is pulled to the front.  If in the front, it is
	pushed to the back.  Any layers affected by the move are
	automatically updated.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    SEE ALSO
	G_PushLayer(), G_PullLayer(), G_ShuffleLayer()

giraffe.library/G_DisownLayer

    NAME
	G_DisownLayer -- relinquish control of layer to its parent.

    SYNOPSIS
	BOOL G_DisownLayer( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	  This sets a flag within the layer so that when its parent
	is closed, it will be also.  Because this is like an indirect
	call to G_CloseLayer(), the pointer is no longer available
	unless a call to G_UseLayer() has also been made.  This 
	function is useful for making a whole tree of layers that
	can be closed with one function call.
	  This function should only be called by the task that called 
	G_OpenLayer().  Because the function cannot tell the 
	difference, it's up to you.

    INPUTS
	layer -- layer pointer returned by G_OpenLayer()
 
    RESULT
	returns TRUE if the call was a success.

    NAME
	G_DropLayer -- decreases the internal usecount value.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_DropLayer( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Releases the user's access to a layer pointer.  Used in
	conjunction with
	G_UseLayer() in order to maintain the validity of a layer
	pointer even after it has been closed.  G_UseLayer() and
	G_DropLayer() must be called equal times.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    SEE ALSO

giraffe.library/G_EndUpdate

    NAME
	G_EndUpdate -- returns clipping to layer visibility.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_EndUpdate( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Used in conjunction with G_BeginUpdate() to refresh a newly
	exposed layer.  When the refresh is complete, this returns
	the layer to its normal clipping state.  It also unlocks
	the layer so that rendering by other processes can resume.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    NAME
	G_RectangleFill -- draws an area filled rectangle.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_FilledRectangle( a0:drawable, struct GC *a1:gc, SHORT d0:left, SHORT d1:top, USHORT d2:width, USHORT d3:height );

    FUNCTION
	Draws a filled rectangle into the drawable.  The corners can
	be beveled using the .Round field of the graphics context.
	This sets the radius of curvature.

    INPUTS
	drawable     -- pointer to a bitmap or layer.
	gc           -- user initialized graphics context.
	left,top     -- upper-left corner.
	width,height -- dimensions of the rectangle.

    NAME
	G_GetLayerBitmap -- get the layer's bitmap pointer.

    SYNOPSIS
	E_EBitMapPtr G_GetLayerBitmap( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Exactly what you think!  This function returns a pointer to 
	the EGS bitmap for the layer tree.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    RESULT
	bitmap -- an EGS bitmap.

    NOTES
	The bitmap is only EGS because I've used those libraries
	as drivers.  If you'd like, you can rewrite the 
	files driver.c/driver.h to use whatever driver you want.

    NAME
	G_GetLayerBounds -- returns a rectangle of layer bounds.

    SYNOPSIS
	BOOL G_GetLayerBounds( G_Layer a0:layer, struct Rectangle *a1:bounds, BOOL d0:global );

    FUNCTION
	Fills the rectangle with the bounds of the layer.  Returns the
	coordinates relative to its parent by default.  If the gloabal
	flag is set 'TRUE', the coordinates are relative to the
	root layer's coordinates.

    INPUTS
	layer  -- a valid layer pointer.
	bounds -- pointer to a rectangle structure to be filled.
	global -- boolean that indicates world coordinates.

    RESULT
	result -- returns 'FALSE' if layer bounds undefined.

giraffe.library/G_GetLayerFrame

    NAME
	G_GetLayerFrame -- fills a frame structure with layer dimensions.

    SYNOPSIS
	BOOL G_GetLayerFrame( G_Layer a0:layer, struct frame *a1:frame, BOOL global );

    FUNCTION
	Fills a frame structure with the origin and size of a layer.
	The global flag indicates that the coordinates are to be
	relative to root layer.  If the layer has an undefined frame
	because it is not mapped, then this function returns 'FALSE'.

    INPUTS
	layer  -- a valid layer pointer.
	frame  -- pointer to a frame structure.
	global -- 'TRUE' indicates coordinates relative to the root.

    RESULT
	result -- returns 'FALSE' if layer frame is undefined.

giraffe.library/G_GetLayerOrigin

    NAME
	G_GetLayerOrigin -- returns coordinate pair of layer origin.

    SYNOPSIS
	BOOL G_GetLayerOrigin( G_Layer a0:layer, union G_Point a1:*xy, BOOL d0:global );

    FUNCTION
	Returns upper-left coordinate of layer.  If the layer bounds
	are not defined, the it returns (0,0) but you can't tell the
	difference.  Passing global as 'TRUE' indicates to return
	the coordinates relative to the root layer.

    INPUTS
	layer  -- a valid layer pointer.
	xy     -- pointer to G_Point union to fill.
	global -- flag indicates coordinates relative to root layer.

    RESULT
	returns FALSE if the coordinates of the layer have
	not been validated by mapping.

    NAME
	G_GetLayerParent -- returns pointer to layer parent.

    SYNOPSIS
	G_Layer G_Layer G_GetLayerParent( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Returns a pointer to the layer's parent.  This pointer is
	'used' so it must be dropped when no longer needed.
	If you don't know what I'm talking about then please don't
	use this function.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    RESULT
	parent -- temporary pointer to the layer's parent.

    NAME
	G_GetLayerSize -- returns coordinate pair of width/height.

    SYNOPSIS
	ULONG G_GetLayerSize( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	As it says, the function returns the size of the layer.  If the
	layer size is not defined because of mapping, then it will
	return the size as NULL, since a layer cannot be of zero
	size.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    RESULT
	size -- coordinate pair of width/height.

giraffe.library/G_LockLayer

    NAME
	G_LockLayer -- gain exclusive access to a layer.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_LockLayer( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	This obtains an internal semaphore on a layer for exclusive
	control and also gets a shared lock on the layer tree so
	that the hierarchy won't be changed.
	  If the layer has already been locked using locklayers(),
	this lock will be made global.  Note: this cannot be done
	the other way around.  A call to locklayer() before 
	locklayers() will result in a freeze.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    RESULT

    BUGS
	Translation of shared to exclusive lock has not been
	implemented.

    SEE ALSO

giraffe.library/G_LockLayers

    NAME
	G_LockLayers -- get an exclusive lock on the layer tree.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_LockLayers( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	This gets an exclusive lock on all the layers in the tree.
	This is used in the example window server when a window is
	being resized and direct drawing into the bitmap is required.

	NOTE: many layer functions make use of these locks and since
	they cannot be used interchangeably, ie. a call to locklayer()
	followed by a call to G_LockLayers() will freeze the system,
	be very careful of their use.


    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    NOTE
	  All locks are given in first come first serve order.
	So for example, if a layer is locked but shared, and
	someone else is waiting for an exclusive lock of the
	entire tree, then if a third process just wants a
	shared lock, then it will be forced to wait.

    FUNCTION
	Makes a layer and all of its children visible and updates
	the clipping of all affected layers.  Prior to calling maplayer()
	all graphics calls will be completely clipped.  This allows
	a window to be popped onto the screen when needed and

    NAME
	G_UnlockLayer -- release a lock obtained by locklayer().

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_UnlockLayer( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Used in conjunction with G_LockLayer() to freeze the
	internal state of a layer.  These functions must be called
	in pairs.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer that has been locked.

    NAME
	G_UnlockLayers -- release lock obtained by locklayers().

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_UnlockLayers( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Used in conjunctionwith locklayers() to get exclusive access
	to a layer hierarchy.  This function must be called in pair
	with locklayer().

    NAME
	G_UnmapLayer -- set complete clipping for layer.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_UnmapLayer( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Clears the clipping regions for the layer so that all graphics
	requests will be completely clipped.  All children of this
	layer are unmapped also and any layers uncovered by this
	operation are automatically updated.  note: both maplayer()
	and unmaplayer() can be used any number of times and the
	state will be defined by the last call.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    RESULT

    NAME
	G_UseFont -- increments the font usecount.

    SYNOPSIS
	G_Font G_UseFont( Font a0:font );

    FUNCTION
	When a font is shared by many different owners the internal
	usecount can be incremented so that each has it's own
	hook into the font.  Then each may call closelayer() independently
	when they are done.

    INPUTS
	G_Font -- font to be shared.

giraffe.library/G_UseLayer

    NAME
	G_UseLayer -- increments the internal usecount value.

    SYNOPSIS
	G_Layer G_UseLayer( G_Layer a0:layer );

    FUNCTION
	Used in conjunction with G_DropLayer() this allows a task to
	keep the layer pointer valid even if the layer has been
	passed to G_CloseLayer() by some other task.  The layer is
	not actually removed from the tree until the internal usecount
	reaches zero.

    INPUTS
	layer -- a valid layer pointer.

    RESULT
	G_Layer -- the same pointer.

giraffe.library/G_Wedge

    NAME
	G_Wedge -- draws a pie wedge.

    SYNOPSIS
	void G_Wedge( a0:drawable, struct GC *a1:gc, SHORT d0:x, SHORT d1:y, USHORT d2:width, USHORT d3:height, SHORT d4:ang1, SHORT d5:ang2 );

    FUNCTION
	Draws a wedge from an area filled ellipse.  The ellipse is 
	defined the same as in the arc() function.  The angles range
   	from 0 to 255 for a complete arc.  So 64 = 90 degrees.

    INPUTS
	drawable     -- either a bitmap or a layer.
	gc           -- user initialized graphics context.
	x,y          -- center of ellipse.
	width,height -- size of ellipse.
	ang1,ang2    -- angle swept by wedge.

    RESULT

giraffe.library/G_WhichLayer

    NAME
	G_WhichLayer -- tells which layer is foremost at coordinates.

    SYNOPSIS
	G_Layer G_WhichLayer( G_Layer a0:start, ULONG *a1:xy );

    FUNCTION
	  Checks to see which layer is exposed at the coordinates
	specified by xy.  The start layer can be anyone within the
	the layer tree.  This layer need not be mapped, so long
	as the pointer is valid by openlayer()/uselayer().  The
	coordinates xy are translated to the local origin of the
	returned layer.
	
	IMPORTANT!!!
	  This function calls G_DropLayer() on the layer that you
	pass and G_UseLayer() on the pointer that it returns for
	your convenience.  Please see the examples to see how
	this function is to be used.

    INPUTS
	start -- a valid layer pointer.
	xy    -- pointer to a coordinate pair in root coordinates.

    RESULT
	G_Layer  -- pointer to exposed layer.
	ALSO: xy -- coordinate pair is translated to local origin
	            of the layer.
