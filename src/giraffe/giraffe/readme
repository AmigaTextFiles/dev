  Welcome to the wonderful, but incomplete world of giraffe.
This library was written out of frustration with the graphics
library and after years of incubation and different version,
I've decided to share the fruit of my loin with the world.
  This library is meant to provide much of the funtionality
of both the graphics and layers libraries.  In its original
form, it was to be an RTG library, but implementing line
drawing etc. was too much of a pain.  So enter EGS which I
use for abstracting the graphics hardware.  If you don't like
that, then get out your editor/compiler and rewrite the
driver.* files.

What can giraffe do?
 1.  nice set of primitives: pixels, lines, polygons, ellipses, 
    etc.  each has a consistent API.
 2.  all the functions of the layers library.
 3.  notion of layer is expanded to include all aspects of
    the user interface.  Layers can have children, so that
    buttons etc are themselves layers.
 4.  ideas are stolen from MUI et. al. to make layers self-
    arranging, so font sensitive GUIs should be possible.
 
What will giraffe do?
 I'm planning the following for the future:
 1.  providing a complete set of font tools.
 2.  more primitives: splines, blitting, etc..
 3.  graphics stacks. interpreted tokens for creating a
    list of graphics commands to be executed in order.
 4.  software sprites for drag-drop operations.
 5.  any other good suggestions you may have.  if it's not
    here, then create it yourself and maybe i'll add it to
    the distribution.

  I used the lattice C v5.10 compiler to develope this library.
So you'll have to tweak the makefile to get it to work with
anything else.  I'm not familiar with any other compiler, so
send me ways to generalize my code and I'll make the changes
the next time I release this archive.


  For now, I just wanted to release the library.  I'll try 
to create better documentation as time permits.  If anyone
is interested in collaborating I have no problem with that.
The source code is included so send me suggestions for 
improvement.  You can use the code as much as you'd like,
but if I have acknowledged someone, then please leave it
in there.

  I've recently been side-tracked by some demonstration programs
that will generate a simple OO gui.  If you'd like to see those
then I can make another archive and put it into the aminet
private upload space.  Those programs however are much less
polished than these are so I didn't want to include them
until there was something really nice to show.  Just to poke
your interest, I've made a window server with a few window 
classes that can automatically create multi-threaded programs.
I've made a objects library similar to ShadowV by David Navas
using ppipc library for all communications between processes.

  I await your opinions by e-mail:
    luke@raj2.tn.cornell.edu or if that doesn't work, try
    lemming@cmpm.mst.lanl.gov
