ramdev.device 37.2 (16.12.2002)

- Ported to 'C'.

- Commented out the code that attaches to an expansion device.

- Fixed the code that would attach to an expansion device to
  make it clearer which data structures are being used.

- Failure of the dev_init() function now cleans up after the
  device and frees the device base structure.

- Now uses the library flags to indicate a delayed expunge.

- dev_close() now really performs a unit and device expunge,
  if necessary.

- The unit initialization now checks if the AddTask() call
  was successful and cleans up after itself if it isn't.

- The dev_abort_io() function now actually tries to abort
  I/O requests that are unprocessed.


ramdev.device 37.3 (17.12.2002)

- The dev_begin_io() function now tries to wake up the unit
  task after processing a command on the schedule of the
  caller. Previously, there was a slight chance that the
  task could get stuck and wake up only after another
  I/O request was queued.

- Now actually sets the unit MsgPort type to PA_IGNORE.
  Previously, it was left set to zero which was equivalent
  to PA_SIGNAL.

- Now fills in the device revision number.

- Dropped the Commodore from Commodore-Amiga, Inc.

- Added short clarification that the driver AutoConfig
  initialization would be different from the BindDrivers
  initialization used in the dev_init() routine.


ramdev.device 37.4 (19.12.2002)

- If the unit task and the caller are sharing access to the
  unit, it might be that the task ceases to process the
  I/O request queue. If the deck is stacked against you,
  this can put the task to sleep until the next I/O
  request is queued for it. There is now some more code in
  the driver which will wake up the task once the command
  is processed.


ramdev.device 37.5 (20.2.2003)

- When reading/writing data the offset into the device data buffer
  was off by one sector. Fixed.


ramdev.device 37.6 (20.2.2003)

- Added a missing Enable() to the BeginIO() function.


ramdev.device 37.7 (20.2.2003)

- The unit Task startup parameter was placed at the wrong stack
  offset.
