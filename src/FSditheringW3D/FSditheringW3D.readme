Uploader: thellier@free.fr 
Type: dev/src 
Version: 1 
Requires: Warp3D or Wazp3D library,68020+881 
Architecture: m68k-amigaos >= 3.0.0;

DESCRIPTION 
Sources for doing Floyd Steinberg dithering 

1) Implement the Floyd Steinberg dithering (Alain Thellier)
From a 24 bits picture can convert to W3D_A4R4G4B4,W3D_A1R5G5B5,W3D_R5G6B5,W3D_CHUNKY
Features: 
	Floyd Steinberg algo error diffusion to the five currents 'neighbors' pixels
	Smart float rounding to nearer color
	Manage the special case 'neighbors' pixels are out of screen
	Manage color overflow to next error diffusion
	Change coefs for odd/even lines = serpentine method
So this implementation give certainly the better possible result 

2) Demonstrate how to use Floyd Steinberg dithering with Warp3D's textures (Kas1e)
Load a Limodorum (European Orchid) 24bits picture and dither it nicely to 16 bits

Only usefull for programmers that want high quality textures
