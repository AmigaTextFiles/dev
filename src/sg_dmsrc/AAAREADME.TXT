			Compile Note:
			-------------

It is imperative to note, that this archive may have to have it's paths changed,
before it will compile, unless this is the Aminet version, then it won't :(
It should have come with another archive, sg_dmbin.lha? If it didn't, this
is the Aminet version, and the above archive was not included due to the
legality of the graphics which were ripped right out of Dungeon Master.

If you have any problems, feel free to mail me, but keep it short eh?
I do get charged for e-mail..
