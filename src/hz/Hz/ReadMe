About Hz

This program is intended as a very simple first example for assembly
language programmers that also happens to be a useful tool.

The contents of this archive are:

 · ReadMe - This note
 · Hz.asm - The source code for the Hz program
 · Hz     - The assembled program created from Hz.asm

The program allows you to switch between NTSC (60 Hz) and PAL (50 Hz)
screen modes and is useful for developing NTSC/PAL sensitive games,
demos, and other programs.  Usage is as follows:

Hz [N=NTSC/S|P=PAL/S]

So, for example, Hz n (or N or NTSC) switches to NTSC, Hz PAL switches
to PAL, and so on.  Hz ? supplies a usage summary.  The default action
is to switch to NTSC mode.
