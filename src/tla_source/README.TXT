SOURCECODE FOR T.L.A.
---------------------

Here is most of the sourcecode from our very first demo, T.L.A. It is not
the complete sourcecode, and none of the data files have been included,
so you will not be able to assemble your own version of T.L.A (ohhhh... ;)

This is presented just for those who are interested in getting a few ideas
about how some of the demo effects work (although they are getting quite
old now).


** DISCLAIMER **

STANDARD DISCLAIMERS APPLY, SO IF YOU BLOW UP YOUR MACHINE, OR ELECTROCUTE
THE NEIGHBOUR'S CAT THROUGH USING THIS SOURCECODE, THEN THAT'S YOUR BAD
LUCK! I WON'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES AS A DIRECT OR INDIRECT
CONSEQUENCE OF USING THIS SOURCECODE.


You will probably notice that some of the code is extremely hacky in
places, and that's because I was rushing to get it finished, but if you
see any glaringly stupid errors in the code, then you can let me know.

Hope this is useful to someone out there, and if you do use any of this
code, then don't credit me because it's so embarrasingly bad!!
