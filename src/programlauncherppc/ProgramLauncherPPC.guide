@TOC "Contents"
  This manual is intended as an aid in using the @{B}ProgramLauncherPPC ©@{UB}
  program.  It is not intended to be used as a primer on the commands & applications 
  available to AmigaOS4.
  @{B}ProgramLauncherPPC ©@{UB} is a program that Displays a GUI of the LauncherStart.ini 
  contents that you specify & execute either a ListView item you click on or a Menu Item
  that you select.

  The main reason I wrote this program(s) is because I like the old ToolManager program but 
  got tired of waiting for the Author of that program to get around to porting it to AmigaOS4.
  AmiDock is nice, but it's always displayed on the Workbench only, whereas @{B}ProgramLauncher@{UB}
  will open on the currently active Screen & can be zoomed.

  In order to use @{B}ProgramLauncherPPC@{UB}, you have to have the @{" Requirements " LINK "requirement"}.

@NODE "TroubleShooting" "TroubleShooting ProgramLauncherPPC:"

   First of all, let me state that this section of the help
   system is far from complete.  I've added a lot of error detection
   code to ProgramLauncherPPC but I cannot account for everything that a 
   User's system has installed or things that might be missing.  
   The program has been tested on the AmigaOne PowerPC running AmigaOS4.

   The program has been compiled with gcc V2.95.3.
   
   I've avoided depending on 3rd-party shared libraries (such as MUI, etc), 
   but there might be some code that still uses older shared 
   Amiga-supplied libraries.  
   
   Verify that your system meets the @{" Requirements " LINK "requirement"}.
    
   Next check the ProgramLauncherPPC directory @{" Configuration " LINK "DiskConfig"}.

   Examine the @{" ProgramLauncherPPC.info " LINK "ToolTypes"} file & verify 
   the ToolTypes match your needs & file configuration.
   
   Verify that your problem is not a @{" Known Bug or Limitation " LINK "Bugs"}.
    
   If you have previous version(s) of ProgramLauncherPPC, see if they work for you.

   Try running the program from a Shell/CLI & see what error messages the
   program generates.

   Make sure that you have not changed the Icon toolTypes to garbage (you did 
   keep a backup of the icon didn't you?  If not, unarchive the original icon).
      
   If you have SnoopDOS available use it to see what the program is looking
   for that you do not have installed on your system.
   
   If all this does not solve your problem, then send an email to @{" me " LINK "Author"}.   

   See Also, @{" Warranty           " LINK "warranty"} (yeah right).

@NODE Bugs "Bugs known to the Author of ProgramLauncherPPC:"

  The program has the following limits hard-coded into it:

    * Number of Menu Items you can add: 19 maximum.
    * Maximum number of items in the ListView Gadget: 500.
    * Maximum number of AmiDock imports: 100.
     
  The following bugs are known to the @{" Author: " LINK "Author"}

    The output of some commands will go to the CLI/Shell you started @{B}ProgramLauncherPPC@{UB}
    from, or it will open its own output window if you started from Workbench.  This is not a bug,
    it simply means that the System() command is using the same I/O channels as @{B}ProgramLauncherPPC@{UB}.

    Sometimes, the System() command used to launch your selection returns
    something other than RETURN_OK, (which is zero), a value of less than 5
    (which is RETURN_WARN), is probably not really an Error that concerns
    your selection, but I have to to test the return value of System()
    against something & RETURN_OK makes the most sense to me.  So you can
    probably ignore any System Requesters that state there was an error
    returned as long as the program actually launched for your Amiga PC.

@NODE distribution "ProgramLauncherPPC distribution:"

   @{B}DISTRIBUTION
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~@{UB}
   This software package is @{B}ShareWare@{UB}. It may be put on any
   media which is used for the distribution of ShareWare, like Public
   Domain disk collections, CDROMs or FTP servers.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package, distributors
   should use the complete original distribution. The author cannot be held
   responsible if this software has become unusable due to modifications
   of the distribution contents or of the distribution files themselves.
   There is no limit on the costs of the distribution, e.g. for the media,
   like floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact disks, or the process of
   duplicating.  Such limits have been proven to be harmful to the idea of
   shareware, i.e., instead of reducing the price of the
   floppy disk below the limit, the software was simply removed from the
   master disk.

   Although the @{" Author " LINK Author} does not impose any limit on the 
   distribution of this software, he would like to express his personal 
   opinions on this matter:

   * This software package should be made available to everyone free of
     charge whenever it is possible (so they can send me money instead ;)).

   * If you have acquired this software package under normal conditions
     from a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk at a price higher than
     US $5, then you have definitely paid too much.  Please don't
     support this improper profit-making any longer and switch to a
     less expensive source as soon as possible.

@NODE startup "Running the system:"
@PREV main

  The ProgramLauncherPPC system is invoked by typing the command @{FG SHINE}ProgramLauncherPPC@{FG TEXT}
  or by clicking on the ProgramLauncherPPC icon.  Clicking on any non-empty item in the
  ListView Gadget will invoke the item as a System Command.  You can also hide less-
  frequently-used commands under the @{B}PROGRAMS@{UB} menu.
  
  The up & down arrow (cursor) keys will traverse the ListView Gadget without actually
  running the highlighted item.  This is so that you can traverse the list & delete items
  with the @{B}Delete Item@{UB} Button, if desired.

  All of the menu items available to you should be self-explanatory.
     
  You can edit the LauncherStart.ini file by hand with your favorite editor if you like,
  but be aware that @{B}ProgramLauncherPPC@{UB} will maintain it for you.
