;-		 	      GhostRider Overall History		     -;
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------;
171192 -	Made GR run in GB-Mem. All entry code working fine!
	Changed monitor looks (idea after split-line bug :-)
	Also did sum print routines and the PrintRegs-routine.
191192 -	Made routines to recognize CPU/FPU Chipmem & Kick.
201192 -	Now have pointer and cursor. Added cursor movement.
211192 -	Made code to recon commands and jmp to the assigned routine.
	Added del/bs (+shifted bs) work. Needs convertion to blitter
	though (sigh!). Also added prompt (and prompt-pref)
	Made ASM.bat copy incbins to RAM -> faster assembly.
261192 -	Source birthday (200 savings :-) Also finished diassembler!
271192 -	BUGFIXes in dis/assembler. Major BUGFIX in printroutines!
	(check for bitmap-size overflow was bugged. changed check w>l
291192 -	Made first simple diskroutines, hex- and ASCIIDump.
061292 -	Recoded the disk.library. Now supports df0-3, and check for
	no disk/ADOS check (bootblock).
071292 -	Hard time at school-> little work. Tried to fix a settletime
091292	for the drive, but probs with the CIA. Work on it later.
	Made most of the directory routine. Added flag for userbreak
121292 -	Fixed a MAJOR bug in InitDrive: SeekZero was not called when
	new disk was inserted->funny dirs:)
131292 -	Fixed the keyboardbug. Finaly made the DEOL-cmd. Fixed the
	Reset entry (needed to init sum bfxxxx regs. see ROM)
	Inserted some cache-clearin' calls after ChipMem-transfer
	Made insert/overwrite select on alt+del
151292 -	Finished the ?-command. Made pointer+cursor adjust to screen
	size. Recoded CHIPbackup - only clear-entry available now.
	Most of symbol control commands made
161292 -	Hexdump entry finished. ASCIIDump entry finished (prob with
	determining end of text though!). Made breakline option for
	the disassembler (for different types!)
201292 -	Now disassembles line after assembly. Cmds can now be given
	at any xpos (Niemeier).
241292 -	Fixed bug caused by ^. Added HELP page.
271292 -	Made ReadBlock command. Added timeout to motoron. SP is saved
	before commands are called, and PrintError restores it. No
	problems with nested calls. Made ReadTrack command.
281292 -	Made FindText command with joker and case-control. With this
	also the AddressTable-dump command (print result of find/cmp)
	Redid printhexX : S - short/long (24/32), L - leading zeros
070193 -	Added alt+bs shortcut for CLS.
080193 -	Added cursor blink (on/off times in pref). Redid the Check-
	CPU routine (presumed VBR=0 coz used after reset. Still needs
	proper '040-code+I don't dig the 881/882 check ;(
	Enabled data-cache at entry. Made get/set CACR, checks CPU>10
	Keyboard handshake now waits 4 lines instead of looping.
	^ from 'how_to_code'. Also added another copperlist-end.
	Started working on the HexDumpEditor.
090193 -	Optimized PrintHex AND the HexDump routines.
	Added exception-handler for internal debugging.
	HexDumpEditor now scrolls up, down & rigth. Shift jumps to
	start/end. Alt jumps to prev/next b/w/l. Crozing 0 will act
	different on 24/32-bit. 24 will jmp to ROM-end. 32 to -1
	Finished cursor movement + sum funcs in HexEditor.
100193 -	Made PrintHeader clear before printing. Also copied to ?Ctrl.
	Made PrintInfoHeader to inform of data on current address.
110193 -	Added insert space with shift+space.+pc_CLRLine cmd to print.
	Added prev/next/last word to editor. Command history added.
150193 -	Added ClearLine on alt+return.
160193 -	Major problem: Need to make error-pointer in getvalue for
	header-input to work. Now an error in input will cause EDIT
	to exit. - How do error-pointer in header? - error flag?
170193 -	Made pref for clear pointer. Pointer used for error-pointing.
220193 -	Made GetValueCall, not jumping to print error. Made space in
	header for 5 flags. Updated with PrintFlags. Called at all
	main loops. Finished HeaderInput-routine. Made Edit-jump.
230193 -	Commented HI. Made HI do history without alt. Finished Hex-
	Dump-Editor and added new cmds. Last error can be displayed
	in the header with HELP.
240193 -	Made ASCII-editor. Now editors only clear at entry -> faster
	+smoother scroll (Jes)
250193 -	Made progress-bar for find-text. New arg for FT - ' ' joker!
	Added Resume (res) command. Editors now jump to entries in
	hunt-buffer with '<'/','/'.'/'>'.
300193 -	Speed up clearline -> clearrest - no double print.
310193 -	Made GetValue routine - utilizes reverse Polish notation :-)
010293 -	Added EV_NOVALUE to GetValue.
150293 -	Added quick-check in hex-editor: a/d/h dumps from distant add
180293 -	Made text-backup for editors - PrintScreen for buffer restore
190293 -	Killed dual-screen plans - now help-screen. CharPointer left
	for add-cmds! Made "online help". Shift-exit in editors leave
	dump on screen.
240293 -	Made area copy and fill in editors.
020393 -	Fix bug in ASCIIEditor (pageup/down jump too small)
060393 -	Changed [] usage to {} - reserved [] for the assembler.
160393 -	Started to work on the new assembler.
090493 -	Finished full M680x0/M6888x/M68851 assembler!
	(except pmove, ptst)
180493 -	Disassembler also finished now (except pmove & ptest)
200493 -	Finished debugging of disassembler.
010593 -	Finished debugging of assembler.
020593 -	GOTO last char now on shiftright. Made dumpers work on area
	space halts - shift pauses. Added CLI help command.
100593 -	Fixed gfx-blurp when scrolling.
140593 -	^ Does not work! (wonder what's causing it). Added PMOVE to
	disassembler.
160593 -	Added BreakOut on the exit-gadget (right+left mouse). Broken
	address in BOAdd.
170593 -	Added PMOVE to assembler.
180593 -	Added PTEST to dis/assembler.
190593 -	Made disassembler use two lines if cmd is too long for one.
	Fixed bug in <cursor to rightmost letter>
240593 -	P2-Project finished. Time to get serious!
250593 -	At last got the chance to test GR on AGA - working A-OK! :=)
	Also made it run on a Productivity/VGA system.(Thanx to Lars)
	Some problems with the dumplines on the productivityscreen.
	Solved by letting DL use ROM-scroll (fix headbang later)
	^ also fixed textblurp (at last!)
	Added fast-scrollarea. d * <end>, dump from current to <end>.
	Scrollroutine now waits for splitline, not BLANK -> + SPEED!
	BUGFIX:Lineassembler accepts address on any xpos.
	Improved handshake timing in keyboardreader.
	Fixed bug in GetValue ( 'value)' forced end of evaluation)
280593 -	Added assemblecondition for CLI versions.
	Added keep area/last area in editors. Fixed size=0 bug in
	editor-fill/-copy.
040693 -	Made disassembler do the breakline check. Return flags in d0.
230693 -	Made the disassemble backwards routine. DisEdit starting to
	take form. CB not in DE header. Changed in assembler again
	Redid what waz done 250593 - 'val)' forced end of eval???
	Dis/Ass put in include. (Asm1 bug with big source+inc!)
240693 -	All code 'objectized'. All routines/text/data in separate sources.
	Maybe i should start local historyfiles...
	DisEditor now scrolls up'n'down.
270693 -	Tried to use the IncLinc of Trashm to save some assembling time, but
	without luck. The functuanality is very poor, and - for what i could
	see - does not support pc-relative references.
280693 -	Added standard editor functions to dis-editor. Upwards disassembly is
	still somewhat... well, awefull! Instead of the fillmode of hex/ascii
	a NOP filler have been added.
290693
260893 -	The '030 GForce DIED!!!!!!!! No coding at all this summer - SHIT!
	In the end of Aug I got my slimy hands on a HD controller and
	some RAM. Slowly starting to work again.
300893 -	Cleaned up the lowlevel disk routines. Now they all work A-OK!
	Added lowlevel disk savers. - Still need the DOS1+ info before I
	wanna do the file-routines. (Now certified developer so it should
	be possible to get my hands on some data pretty soon....)
