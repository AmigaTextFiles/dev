The Screen Mode Definition window is too high for a standard NTSC non-laced
WB screen. If you use this resolution, please consider switching to a lace
resolution before using this preference editor.
@endnode

@node "Screen" "GRPref/Screen"
Screen Color:           Color of screen.

Text Color:             Color of text.


Header Color:           Color of background in header.

Header Text Color:      Color of text in header.


Cursor Color:           Color of cursor.

Pointer 1:              Color 1 of pointer.

Pointer 2:              Color 2 of pointer.


Screen Mode:            Select one of the five defined screen modes.

Edit:                   Edit the chosen screen mode (will open the 
                        @{"screen mode editor" link "EditScreenMode" 0}).
@endnode

@node "EditScreenMode" "GRPref/Screen Mode Editor"
Mode Name:              The name of this screen mode. Will be used for
                        identification in both preference editor and
                        GhostRider.

Text Lines:             The number of text lines in this screen mode.
                        The minimum is 20 lines (for no good reason). The
                        maximum number of lines is set to 51. This gives a
                        bitplane size of approximately 32Kb which is all GR
                        can handle.

System View:            If this flag is set, the graphics library command
                        LoadView will be called with a NULL parameter,
                        which will reset the display. However, if you use
                        the same screen modes on the system side and in
                        GhostRider this is really not necessary. But that
                        is not why it was included! Another problem with
                        resetting the display is that multisync monitors
                        will have to resync two times - and that, I might
                        add, is a perfectly good reason for including this
                        option :)

Custom Display:         This will activate the bottom 12 settings when the
                        display is programmed in GhostRider - that is, the
                        values will be stored. You may control whether the
                        display chips use the data or not with the beamcon0
                        data. Which remind me;

**** Disclaimer ****

If you are not 100% sure about what you are doing, do _not_ change other
settings than the number of text lines and diw/ddf values. I will not take
any responsibility for monitors damaged because of incorrect settings!

Excerpt from Commodore's Hardware Reference Manual:
 "Incorrectly writing directly to BEAMCON0 has the (remote) possibility of
destroying your multisync monitor."

**** Disclaimer ****

The remaining entries are all data which is written directly to the hardware
custom registers with the same name. If you want to know about what they do,
consult Commodore's Hardware Reference Manual or some other litterature with
the information. Below is only small notes where I have something specific
to add;

diwstrt:                The display ypos of diwstrt will be rounded to a
                        multiple of four.

diwstop:                The display ypos of diwstop will be calculated from
                        diwstrt, the number of text lines and the lace
                        status of bplcon0. 

ddfxxx:                 Should only be changed in multisync modes.

beamcon0:               Remember the excerpt above! Only change if you know
                        what you are doing.

bplcon0:                This register have two possible (well, four)
                        values:
                        $9200 - Standard high res.
                        $1241 - Multisync.

                        Also, you may get a lace display by setting bit 2
                        ($9204/$1245).

hbstrt-diwhigh:         You had better know what you are doing. A bit of
                        advice though: MonEd values does _not_ match
                        correct display settings - weird, eh? Have a look
                        at my multisync default values and see if you dig -
                        I don't. It took some monitor clicking to find
                        those values :)
@endnode

@node "Disk" "GRPref/Disk"
Default Drive:          Since GR only can handle one drive at the time,
                        specify which drive you want to have active at
                        first entry.

Retries:                Number of retries in case of read errors.

Disk Verify:            This flag controls if disk writes should be
                        verified.

Disk Sync:              Sync-value used when accessing disk.
                        Can also be changed from within the monitor.

DD Track Length:        Length of tracks on DD disks.
                        Can also be changed from within the monitor.

HD Track Length:        Length of tracks on HD disks.
                        Can also be changed from within the monitor.

BM Reserved:            Character identifying a reserved disk block.

BM Free:                Character identifying a free disk block.

BM Used:                Character identifying a used disk block.
@endnode

@node "Input" "GRPref/Input"
Delay Speed:            Delay speed of keyboard.

Repeat Speed:           Repeat speed of keyboard.

Edit Mode:              Default edit mode (insert/overwrite). Can also be
                        changed from within the monitor.

PointerBlanker:         Blank the pointer at keypress (not qualifiers)?

Paste Key:              Press this key and left Amiga to paste the
                        snap-buffer. This is a character-based hot-key, not
                        key mapped. This means that pasting may be
                        activated by more than one key combination... It
                        shouldn't be a problem though.
@endnode

@node "Disassem" "GRPref/Dis/Assembler"
Suppres Leading Zeros:  Most of the output in GR is controlled by this
                        flag. Set it if you prefer $4 over $0000004.

Short Address:          If you only work in 24-bit memory, there is really
                        no need to print addresses in 32-bit. Or what do
                        you think :)

Negative Offsets:       Print $ffff(Ax) as -$1(Ax)... Your choice.

ASCII after DC.x:       You might want to see the ASCII-representation of a
                        dataword in the disassembler.

Disassemble Next:       Disassemble the command after the one you have just
                        assembled? (cryptic or what? Try the lineassembler
                        with and without.)


Dump Lines:             How many lines do you want each time you press
                        return when disassembling/dumping memory?


Break Lines:            Specify where you want to see breaklines in your
                        disassembly.


Long Disassembly:       With this flag you can increase the area scanned
                        when GhostRider is disassembling backwards. The two
                        scan ranges are 30 and 50 bytes. The long range
                        _may_ give a better disassembly if there is many
                        long (FPU and 'o2o+ extended EA) commands. The long
                        range reduces the disassembly speed, though.
@endnode

@node "Memory" "GRPref/Memory"
Chip Memory:            Default place of the workspace in chip memory.
                        Change this if you only have 512KB of chip memory.


RAM Banks:              Enter whatever RAM banks you have in your system.
                        ChipMem area should be Bank0. Fill the table from
                        the top (0-5). Fill double NULL in unused Banks.
                        This Bank table is currently only used by the
                        memorypeeker.
                        Please not that if the RAM banks are not sorted in
                        increasing order, the peeker will not operate
                        correct. Example:
                        $200000-$5fffff before $f80000-$ffffff before
                        $7800000-$7ffffff.
@endnode

@node "Startup" "GRPref/Startup"
Reset Entry:            When running GR from $Fxxxxx RAM you can specify a
                        qualifier for activation at reset. This setting now
                        also applies for Cold-reset entry.

NMI entry from ROM:     Should GR start if you press NMI while the CPU is
                        working in ROM? Great for debugging system soft.

Coppersearch Offset:    At each entry the chip memory is searched for the
                        copperlists. However, only at the first entry is
                        there made a full scan. At any subsequent entries
                        the area around the previous copperlocation will be
                        searched first. Specify the the size of this
                        pre-scan area with this value. A NULL will force
                        full scan on every entry if your system does not
                        hardwaremap custom-register RAM to $F3x or $F7x.

Clear Matrix:           Should the keyboard matrix of keyboard.device be
                        cleared at exit? This is a good idea if you use a
                        hot-key to start GhostRider.

Clear Screen:           Should the screen be cleared at entry? If not, you
                        will see the text from when you previously exit'ed
                        GhostRider.
@endnode

@node "Misc" "GRPref/Miscellaneous"
Prompt:                 Your prefered prompt-character.

Non-ASCII:              How do you want Non-ASCII characters represented?

Text Joker:             Character used to specify wildcards in search- and
                        other operations. I can only warn you against using
                        '0', even though it should work (see, I got the
                        brains to know that trying is no good. Guess that
                        makes me a superhero... kind'a anyway :)

Progress Bar:           Something to look at while your poor computer
                        wastes it's time on comparing bits.. or whatever
                        your mood has been up to..... Mayby I should
                        implement a ProgressBar-Blanker... Nah, people
                        would think your Ami waz some PeeCee running
                        Windows©®TM :)


Peeker Height:          Height of Memory Peeker. Changes height in steps of
                        four lines. Can also be changed from within GR.
@endnode

@node "KeyMap" "GRPref/KeyMap"
Because I have some trouble with finding a functional design for the keymap
preference editor, I have decided to release a simple assembler source that
assembles into a keymap-binary to be loaded with the DeckRunner. This may
not be a userfriendly way of doing it, but I believe that most users of GR
also know how to use an assembler. The source is made for ASM1... You may
need to change some things before assembling it with your assembler.
@endnode

@node "Load" "GRPref/Load"
Load preferences from disk. Default filename is S:GhostRider.Prefs. You may
(of course) specify another, but the DeckRunner will only search for this
filename.

When loading a preference file, the revision number of the file will be
examined. If the revision number differs from that of the preference editor,
you will be warned that the settings may be corrupted. As of version 38.4 of
the preference editor, the pref-format will only expand in the bottom (no
swapping of settings... None planed anyway :) This will make it possible to
load old preference files, change whatever is needed, save and be ready for
action within 20 secs of receiving the newest release of GR ;o)
@endnode

@node "Save" "GRPref/Save"
Save preferences to disk. Default filename is S:GhostRider.Prefs. You may
(of course) specify another, but the DeckRunner will only search for this
filename.
@endnode

@node "Default" "GRPref/Default"
Return settings to GhostRider default (build-in) preferences. These settings
are in no way guaranteed to be the same from release to release. Depends on
whatever mood I'm in at the time of compilation :-)
@endnode

@node "Quit" "GRPref/Quit"
Quit the preference editor. You will be asked to confirm if the settings
have been changed since last saving.
@endnode
