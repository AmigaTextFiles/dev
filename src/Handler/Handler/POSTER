An example that implements a AmigaDos Handler (device) in non-BCPL format by
using a new feature introduced in system software release 1.2.

What follows is a shar file which contains the following files:

makefile        ... guess...make for both my-handler and ihand
my-handler.c    ... this is the main handler module 
misc.c          ... this module contains support routines (packet handling)

ihand.c         ... a program to install your device node 
AddDosNode.asm  ... some interface code for Aztec people who don't have
                    a library that supports 1.2
