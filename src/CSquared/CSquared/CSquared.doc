CircleSquared from Sept. '86 Scientific American "Computer Recreations"
column produces wildly colorful but mathematically precise patterns on
your Amiga display.  There is also a treatment of this topic in the
Oct. '86 issue of Computer Language in their "Theory & Practice" column.
It doesn't take nearly as long as the generation of a Mandelbrot either.

The program is controlled thru standard intuition menus, gadgets,
and requesters.  Most of the important operating parameters, i.e. corna,
cornb, side, and modval, are modifiable thru these gadgets, requesters,
menues and such.

   corna  - the X coordinate of the upper left hand corner of the window
   cornb  - the Y coordinate of the upper left hand corner of the window
   side   - the length of the side of the square
   modval - the modulus value that determines the color of the pixel at
            the point(i, j)

The following calculations are made for each point plotted on the display.
Note that this routine, PlotPoints(), was written using the Motorola
Fast Floating Point library.

   x = corna + side * i/linesize
   y = cornb + side * j/linesize
   z = x * x + y * y
   c = z MOD modval

The point at coordinates (i,j) is colored with color "c".  Note that
the palette of colors is also modifiable thru another requester
containing sixteen color selection gadgets.  Three proportional
gadgets allow the modification the Red, Green, and Blue components
of the selected color.

The CLOSEWINDOW gadget causes the program to exit.

Also note that there is a Hi-Res mode of operation.  Instead of invoking
the program (from the CLI) as "CSquared" include a runtime parameter of
"-h" such that the new invocation becomes "CSquared -h".  Lo-Res is the
default mode of operation.

I freely admit that this program is a hack and was strictly done for
my own personal entertainment.  I am new to C so if you see any wretched
code perhaps you will be understanding.  (I'm also new to the Amiga.)
I am placing this program into the public domain although if you make use
of major portions of the code please give credit where credit is due.
(I'd like to see my name up in lights, too.)  Have fun!

This program compiles cleanly under Lattice C version 3.03.  No other
external routines are required except for some of those found in Lattice's
LC.LIB and, of course, AMIGA.LIB.  The standard c.o startup code is also
used as well.
