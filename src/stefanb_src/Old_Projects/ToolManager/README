DISTRIBUTION

   This software package is freely distributable. It may be transfered to
any media which is used for the distribution of free software like Public
Domain disk collections, CDROMs, FTP servers or bulletin board systems.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package distributors
should use the original archive file ToolManager2_1b.lha  (file  name  on
Aminet: ToolManagerUpd.lha). The author cannot  be  made  responsible  if
this software package has become unusable due  to  modifications  of  the
archive contents or of the archive file itself.

   There is no limit on the fee taken by distributors, e.g. for the media
costs of floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact discs, or the process of
duplicating. Such limits have proven to be harmful to the idea of  freely
distributable software, e.g. the software package was removed instead  of
reducing the price of a floppy disk below the limit.

   Although the author does not impose any limit on these fees  he  would
like to express his personal opinions on this matter:

   * This software package should be made available to everyone  free  of
     charge whenever this is possible.

   * If you have purchased this software package under normal  conditions
     from a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk and have paid more than
     5DM or US $5 then you have definitely paid too  much.  Please  don't
     support this improper profit making  any  longer  and  switch  to  a
     cheaper source as soon as possible.


USAGE RESTRICTIONS

   No program, document, data file or  source  code  from  this  software
package, neither in whole nor in part, may be used on any  machine  which

     machine which is  used  in  the  education  for  any  of  the  above
     mentioned purposes.

I. Description
==============

This small package contains an update to the (still) current  ToolManager
2.1 release. Changes since that release:

    toolmanager.library  V3.2 - Added support for ScreenNotify
                              - Added support for WBStart 2.0
                              - Requires OS 3.0 (V39) or better
    screennotify.library V1.0 - Notify on screen close/private/public
    wbstart.library      V2.0 - From WBStart 2.0 package
                              - Requires OS 3.0 (V39) or better
    toolmanager.doc           - Missing AutoDocs for toolmanager.library

ToolManager  now  supports  ScreenNotify,  a  library  which  sends   out
notifications when a public screen is opened or closed. This  means  that
it is now possible to open docks automatically on a public  screen  after
it has been opened. The docks  will  be  closed  automatically  when  the
screen is closed. Now you can change the screen mode  of  your  Workbench
without manually closing all your ToolManager docks!

The automatic open/close feature only works if  you  specify  the  public
screen name for a dock object. It won't work for dock  objects  with  the
"FrontMost" flag set or for docks which should open on the default public
screen. You must also set the "Activated" flag for the dock object.

Every time a public screen is  opened  ToolManager  will  scan  all  dock
objects and open all docks which have the same public screen name as  the
newly opened screen. When a public screen is  closed  ToolManager  closes
all open docks on this screen and marks them. If  the  public  screen  is
opened again ToolManager will reopen all marked docks.

ToolManager has been updated for the new WBStart 2.0 package. WBStart  is
now also a library so the old L:WBStart-Handler is  not  needed  anymore.
Due to the changes in the WB startup method emulation you might  have  to
update some of your Exec Objects.



II. Installation
================

If you already use ToolManager 2.1 then copy the following files  to  the
appropriate directories:

    libs/toolmanager.library    ->  LIBS:
    libs/screennotify.library   ->  LIBS:
    libs/wbstart.library        ->  LIBS:

If you have used ToolManager 2.1 or 2.1a already then please  remove  the
file L:WBStart-Handler. It is not needed anymore for this version.

If you never have used ToolManager before then you have  to  install  the
release 2.1 first. It may be found on Fish Disks/CDROMs or on AmiNet.



III. Question & Answers
=======================

Q: When I change the  screen  mode  of  my  Workbench  or  start  certain
   applications then the ToolManager docks will disappear forever. I have
   to start the Preferences Editor and press Save to get my docks back.

A: You have installed the screennotify.library but you have forgotten  to
   enter the name "Workbench" in the Public Screen string gadget  in  the
   Dock Object edit window. ToolManager can always close the docks but to
   open them it has to know on which Public Screen they should appear.

Q: After installing ToolManager 2.1b some of my Exec Objects of the  type
   WB don't work anymore.

A: The WB startup method pf WBStart 2.0 has been made more compatible  to
   the real Workbench. Therefore some of the old path settings might  not
   work anymore. Please check the paths in your Exec Objects. A  look  at
   the output of a tool like SnoopDos might be helpful.



IV. Warnings
============

ToolManager in conjunction with ScreenNotify will cause dead locks  under
certain conditions. When a dead lock occurs  you  can't  move  the  mouse
pointer anymore or enter anything on the keyboard. These dead locks occur
most of the time when other programs want to close a public screen.

Unfortunately there is no way to  circumvent  this  problem,  so  if  you
experience dead locks with many of  your  normal  applications  then  you
can't use ScreenNotify at all and MUST remove  the  screennotify.library.
ToolManager will still work without this library, but  you'll  loose  the
automatic dock open/close feature.

If you are using MUI 2.3 (or older) you MUST NOT open docks automatically
on MUI public screens or a dead lock will occur! This  problem  has  been
fixed in MUI 3.0 and up.
