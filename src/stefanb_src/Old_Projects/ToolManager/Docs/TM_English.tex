@cindex V38 (and higher) features

Welcome to the wonderful world of ToolManager 2.1 :-)

@itemize @minus

@item
ToolManager and its concepts have drastically changed (@pxref{History})
since the release 1.5.

@item
Starting with the ToolManager 2.0 release, this program has a @emph{GiftWare}
option. If you like the program and use it very often, you should consider to
send a little donation to honor the work that the author has put into this
program. I suggest a donation of US $10-$20 or 10-20 DM. Please don't send
cheques or money orders from outside Europe, because most often cashing those
items costs more than what they amount to.

If you don't send the donation or can't afford it, you needn't feel bad
about it. Please send me a note saying that you are using ToolManager anyway
(I like to get fan mail :-). @xref{Authors address}.

@item
Users of ToolManager 1.X/2.0 can start with the quick installation chapter
(@pxref{Quick installation}). Some features haven't changed and the rest is
fairly easy to find out by trial & error. For a detailed description of the
new concept & features browse the reference part of this document
(@pxref{Objects}).

You @strong{must} remove any running ToolManager 1.X/2.0 or the new version
won't work. The new version cannot read the old 1.X configuration file format
(Sorry).

@item
First-time users should read the entire document to understand the concept and
purpose of the program. Start with @ref{Introduction}.

@item
ToolManager 2.1 uses some features of AmigaOS Release V38 (and higher) and it
supports the new AmigaOS networking features, which will (hopefully) be
available soon to all Amiga users. If you are still using Release 2.0 (referred
to as V37 in this document), you need not worry since ToolManager doesn't rely
on these features. All extended features are marked in this documentation.

@cindex Fast installation
@cindex Installation (quick)
@cindex Quick installation

The basic ToolManager 2.1 installation consists of the following four parts:

@table @asis
@item @file{Libs/toolmanager.library} @result{} @file{LIBS:}
This is the main program of ToolManager. It handles all programs, menus, icons
and docks (@pxref{Library}).

@item @file{Prefs/ToolManager*} @result{} @file{SYS:Prefs}
This is the editor for the configuration (@pxref{Preferences}).

@item @file{WBStartup/ToolManager*} @result{} @file{SYS:WBStartup}
With this utility you can start and stop ToolManager. If it resides in the
WBStartup drawer, ToolManager gets always loaded when your machine boots
up.

@item @file{L/WBStart-Handler} @result{} @file{L:}
This program starts programs by the Workbench startup method. It is a
seperate process, so that you can quit ToolManager even if you have still
programs running that were started by it with the WB method.
@end table

After copying these files, you should quit any older version of ToolManager
running on your machine and double-click the ToolManager icon in the
@file{WBStartup} drawer. Now you can start the preferences editor and play
around (Use the ``Test'' button instead of the ``Use'' button while testing).
You should be able to figure out most features with trial & error, for further
information look into the ToolManager object descriptions (@pxref{Objects}).

The distribution includes an example configuration file called
@file{TM_Demo.prefs}. You can load it into the preferences editor with the
@code{Open} menu item.

@chapter What is ToolManager?
@cindex Introduction to ToolManager

ToolManager is a flexible program to manage the tools in your working
environment. It can start Workbench and CLI programs, ARexx scripts and
generate HotKey events. It even can issue commands to a ToolManager running on
a remote machine. The user interface consists of menus, icons or dock windows.
If you like a noisy computer, you can associate a sound to each of these items.
@xref{Sound, Sound objects}.

ToolManager can add items to the Workbench @code{Tools} menu. If you select
such a menu item, the program associated with it will be started. Every
selected icon on the Workbench will be used as an argument for the program.
This feature is only available when the Workbench is running. @xref{Menu,Menu
objects}.

ToolManager can add icons to the Workbench window. When you double-click such
an icon, the program associated with it will be started. If you drop some
icons on this icon, the program will be started with these icons as arguments.
This feature is only available when the Workbench is running. @xref{Icon,Icon
objects}.

ToolManager can create a dock window from a collection of programs. This
window can be opened on every public screen. Each program is represented by an
image or a button gadget. To start a program you simply click on the image or
the button gadget. If the dock window has been opened on the Workbench screen
and the Workbench is running, you can also drop some icons on the image or the
button gadget to start the program with arguments. @xref{Dock,Dock objects}.

Additionally you can assign a Hot Key to each program. If you press this Hot
Key, the program will be started. Note that @emph{no} arguments can be
passed to the program if you use this startup method. @xref{Exec,Exec
objects}.

@chapter The concepts behind ToolManager
@cindex Concepts
@cindex Introduction to ToolManager objects
@cindex Program concepts

ToolManager 2.1 uses a new object-oriented approach to provide a flexible and
extendable system. This approach made it possible to enhance several
ToolManager features of the 1.X versions, e.g.@: you can now have multiple
docks.

An object is a collection of data which describes its features. Each object
has a name and a type. You can create as many objects of each type as you
want, but the name of each object has to be unique, because it is used as a
reference to this object.

Currently there are seven different types of objects: Exec, Image, Sound, Menu,
Icon, Dock and Access. The first three of them are basic objects; that means
they don't reference other objects. They provide data or services for the
complex objects.

The last four object types are complex objects; that means they reference
simple objects and rely on them to get access to data or services. The
reference is done by name, and if no simple object with this name exists, the
complex object will ignore it. Note that this may reduce the functionality of
the complex object, e.g. an Icon object @emph{needs} the data from an Image
object, so if this object doesn't exist it won't create an icon.

For a detailed description of all object parameters see @ref{Objects}.

@chapter A guided tour through ToolManager
@cindex Tutorial
@cindex Guided tour
@cindex Example

So you haven't understood a word until now? Confused by objects, programs and
links? Don't despair, help is on the way.

I will now guide you through a step-by-step example on how to configure
ToolManager. All you need is to install ToolManager and to run the preferences
editor. After each step, use the ``Test'' button in the main window to test the
configuration.

As an example we use the text display program More in the drawer
@file{SYS:Utilities}. First we must tell ToolManager which program we want to
use. Information about programs is stored in Exec objects. Just select ``Exec''
as object type in the main window of the preferences editor and press the
``New'' button.

After pressing the button you will see the ``Edit Exec Object'' window. Now
open the Utilities drawer in your Workbench partition, move the More icon out
of the drawer and drop it on the edit window. As you can see, the editor has
now set the name of the object and the command to the program name, and the
current directory to System:Utilities. Press the ``OK'' button to use the
settings.

You can't do much with the Exec object alone, so as next step we want to add
this program to the ``Tools'' menu of the Workbench. Select ``Menu'' as object
type and press the ``New'' button. Now you will see the ``Edit Menu Object''
window. Change the name of the object to ``Display Text''.

ToolManager has to know which program it should start when the menu item is
selected, so we link an Exec object to the menu object. Press the ``Exec
Object'' button and select the object ``More'' from the requester. Now press
``OK'' button and the ``Test'' button in the main window. You can now see an
entry in the ``Tools'' menu. Select a text file from the Workbench and choose
the new menu entry. The program ``More'' should start and display the text.
This is easy, isn't it?

Now we can go a step further and create an icon object on the Workbench. For an
icon we need some image data, which is stored in an image object. Select
``Image'' as object type and press the ``New'' button. The ``Edit Image
Object'' window will open. Change the name to ``Image for More'' and drop the
More icon from the Utilities drawer on the window. Press ``OK'' to use the
settings.

In the next step we will create the icon object. Select ``Icon'' as object type
and press the ``New'' button. Change the name of the object to ``Show Text''.
Press the ``Exec object'' button and select the object ``More'' from the
requester. Press the ``Image object'' button and select the object ``Image for
More'' from the requester. Set the X position to 100 and the Y position to 50.
Press the ``OK'' button and the ``Test'' button. After a short delay an icon
will appear on the Workbench, on which you can drop the icons of your text
files to display them.

I'm sure you now have an idea how to use ToolManager objects and in which way
you have to link them together to build your environment. Now you can figure
out the rest of the features by trying them out one by one. You may also look
at the demo configuration in the file @file{TM_Demo.prefs}.

created by different authors, they come from different environments (palette,
depth, resolution, size) and have different design styles. So not all images
may look good on your machine.

To differentiate the image formats that are supported by ToolManager, each
file has a postfix which describes the file format:

@table @file
@item .anmb
This is an IFF ANIM file created by a paint/animation program. It can contain
several pictures. Although ToolManager can load complete ANIM files, you
must use something like DPaints ``AnimBrush'' feature to cut out the
interesting part of the animation.

@item .brush
This is an IFF ILBM file created by a paint program. It contains only one
image.

This chapter describes the ToolManager objects in detail. Each object has a
type and a name. The name is used to reference the object. There are six
different types of objects:

@menu
* Exec::       Exec objects
* Image::      Image objects
* Sound::      Sound objects
* Menu::       Menu objects
* Icon::       Icon objects

@node Exec, Image, , Objects
@section Exec objects
@cindex Exec objects

Exec objects describe programs or actions which are started by ToolManager.
Three different types of programs are supported: CLI, Workbench and ARexx.
Three different types of actions are supported: Dock, Hot Key, Network. Each
Exec object has the following parameters. The defaults are set in parantheses:

@table @asis
@item @code{Arguments} (Yes)
This switch controls the handing over of arguments to the program. If a
program doesn't support arguments or doesn't need them, you can switch off the
argument passing.

@item @code{Command}
The file name of the program or action to start. This name may be relative to
the current directory. If the type is Dock, the command describes the name of
the dock object, which should be opened/closed. For the type Hot Key this
string must be a Commodities Input Description String (@pxref{Hot Keys}). A
remote command (type Network) is described as @code{object@@machine}, which
tells the ToolManager running on @code{machine} to activate the Exec object
named @code{object}.

@item @code{Current Directory} (@file{SYS:})
The name of the current directory for the program. Note: ARexx programs ignore
this parameter.

@item @code{Delay} (0)
After activation of an Exec object, ToolManager waits @code{Delay} seconds
before it starts the program. If this value is negative, the program will be
started every @code{Delay} seconds. To stop an Exec object which is waiting
for execution, just activate it again. Note: If @code{Delay} is set, the
program will be started without arguments.

@item @code{Exec Type} (CLI)
This specifies the type of the program or action. It can be one of: CLI, WB,
ARexx, Dock, Hot Key or Network.

@item @code{Hot Key}
You can set a Hot Key for each Exec object. If this Hot Key event is
generated, the program will be started. Note: The program will be started
with no arguments.

@item @code{Output File} (@file{NIL:})
This is the file name of the output file. This is only useful for CLI
programs.

@item @code{Path} (path from ToolManager process)
This string sets the command search path for the program. You can specify
several directories by seperating the names with a ``;''. This is only useful
for CLI programs.

@item @code{Priority} (0)
This sets the priority of the new process which runs the program.

@item @code{Public Screen} (default public screen)
You can set the name of the public screen which should be moved to front
before the program is started. This only works in conjunction with the
@code{To Front} parameter.

@item @code{Stack} (4096)
This sets the stack size of the new process which runs the program.

@item @code{To Front} (No)
If you set this parameter the public screen specified by @code{Public
Screen} is moved to front before the program is started.

@node Image, Sound, Exec, Objects
@section Image objects
@cindex Image objects

Image objects specify the image data which is used by ToolManager for icons
or docks. This object type has only one parameter:

@table @code
@item File Name
This specifies the name of the file from which ToolManager should read the
image data. ToolManager tries to detect the type of image data automatically:

@enumerate
@item
It tries to load it as IFF data. Currently ToolManager can read ILBM (one
image) or ANIM (two or more images) files.

@item
It tries to read in an icon file. An icon can have one or two images.
@end enumerate
@end table

Animations are currently only supported by Dock objects. Icon objects only
retrieve the first and the second image from the animation to build a two
image icon. If you want to make an animation for ToolManager, you should
follow these design rules:

@table @asis
@item Image 1
This should be an image which represents the inactive state.

@item Image 2
This should be an image which represents the selected state. Normally this is
an inverted copy of the first image.

@item Image 3 to N-1
These are the images for the animation. Each image will be shown for 1/3 of a
second.

@item Image N
The last picture of the animation will be shown one second. After this the
first picture will be shown again.

@section Sound objects
@cindex Sound objects

A Sound object can be used to make ToolManager noisy. ToolManager itself has
no ability builtin to play sound data, it uses ARexx to activate an external
sound player daemon. This object type has two parameters:

@table @code
@item Command
This sets the ARexx command which ToolManager sends to activate the external
sound player. For @code{upd} this could be something like @code{file
samples:boing} which instructs @code{upd} to play the IFF sample
@file{samples:boing}. @xref{Goodies}.

@item ARexx Port
This specifies the ARexx port where ToolManager should send @code{command} to.
The default is @code{PLAY} which is the port for the program @code{upd}.

Menu objects control the entries in the Workbench Tools menu. The object name
is used as the menu text. To activate such an object, just select the menu
entry. Menu objects only work when the Workbench is running.

This object type has two parameters:

@table @code
@item Exec Object
This is the name of an Exec object which should be activated when the menu
entry is selected. Every icon which is selected at this time will be used as
an argument for the program.

@item Sound Object
This is the name of a Sound object which should be activated when the menu
entry is selected.

Icon objects describe application icons in the Workbench window. Such an
object can be activated by double-clicking the icon or by dropping some icons
on the application icon. Icon objects only work when the Workbench is running.

The parameters for this object type are as follows:

@table @asis
@item @code{Exec Object}
This is the name of an Exec object which should be activated when the icon is
selected. Every icon which is dropped on the application icon will be used as
an argument for the program.

@item @code{Image Object}
This is the name of an Image object. The image data of this object is used to
build the application icon.

@item @code{Left Edge} (default: 0)
This sets the left edge for the application icon.

@item @code{Show Name} (default: Yes)
If this parameter is set, the object name will be used as the name for the
application icon.

@item @code{Sound Object}
This is the name of a Sound object which should be activated when the icon is
selected.

@item @code{Top Edge} (default: 0)
This sets the top edge for the application icon.
@end table

Note: The Workbench is @emph{very} picky about the position of icons. If you
specify coordinates which the Workbench doesn't like, it will ignore them and
place the icon somewhere else.

@node Dock, Access, Icon, Objects
@section Dock objects
@cindex Dock objects

Dock objects describe windows. These windows combine several tools which are
represented by images or gadgets. To start such a tool just click on its image
or gadget. Of course you can drop some icons on the image or gadget to supply
arguments for the tool.

Each dock object has several parameters. The defaults are set in parentheses:

@table @asis
@item @code{Activated} (Yes)
A dock window can be active (open) or not (closed).

@item @code{Backdrop} (No)
This tells the dock window to go immediately to the back after opening.

@item @code{Centered} (No)
If this parameter is set, the window will always be centered to the current
mouse position when it opens.

@item @code{Columns} (1)
This parameter sets the the number of tool columns. Tools are always sorted
row-wise, starting at the leftmost column and filling up to the rightmost
column.

@item @code{Font} (Screen font)
If you have a dock window with the parameter @code{Text} set, you can choose
the font for the button gadgets with this parameter.

@item @code{Frontmost} (No)
If you set this parameter, the dock window will always open on the frontmost
public screen.

@item @code{Hot Key}
You can set a Hot Key for each Dock object. If this Hot Key event is
generated, the activation status of the dock window will be toggled; that is
it will be closed or opened.

@item @code{Left Edge} (0)
This parameter sets the left edge of the dock window. If the parameter
@code{Centered} is set, this parameter will be ignored.

@item @code{Menu} (No)
You can add a small menu to each dock window. This menu has two items:

@itemize
@item @code{Close Dock}
Close dock window.

@item @code{Quit TM}
Quit ToolManager
@end itemize

@item @code{Pattern} (No)
The dock window automatically adjusts its size to the largest image. Each dock
entry has the same size, and smaller images are centered, so they have a blank
border around them. If you don't like this blank border, set this parameter
and the border will be filled with a pattern.

@item @code{PopUp} (No)
When this parameter is set the dock window will be closed automatically after
selecting one dock entry. This is especially useful in conjunction with the
parameters @code{Centered}, @code{Frontmost} and a Hot Key of the class
@code{rawmouse} (@pxref{Hot Keys}).

@item @code{Public Screen} (Default public screen)
Specifies the public screen on which the dock window should open. If the dock
window was opened via Hot Key, the public screen will be moved to front
after the window has been opened. This parameter will be ignored if the
parameter @code{Frontmost} is set.

@item @code{Sticky} (No)
Normally a dock window stores its last position when you close it and pops up
at the same position when you re-open it. If you want the dock window to open
always at the same position, you must set this parameter.

@item @code{Text} (No)
You can choose between images and button gadgets in dock windows with this
parameter. Button dock windows are especially useful when used in conjunction
with the parameter @code{PopUp}.

@item @code{Title}
This specifies the dock window title. If you supply a title, the dock window
will be a normal OS 2.0 window with dragbar, close gadget, depth gadget and a
border. If you @emph{don't} supply a title, you will get a dock window with
only a dragbar and @emph{no} border.

@item @code{Top Edge} (0)
This parameter sets the top edge of the dock window. If the parameter
@code{Centered} is set, this parameter will be ignored.

@item @code{Vertical} (No)
If the dock window has the new window design (that is: only a dragbar and no
border), this parameter sets the orientation of the dragbar. This parameter is
ignored if you supplied a window title with the parameter @code{Title}.

@node Access, , Dock, Objects
@section Access objects
@cindex Access objects

Access objects control the access rights for network requests. Per default
@emph{every} request is denied, so a remote ToolManager can't harm the
operation of your machine by activating some of your Exec objects. With Access
objects you can allow specific machines to activate some of your Exec objects.

The name of an Access object has a special meaning. It is matched with the name
of the remote machine from which a network request was sent. ToolManager uses
the following three step matching scheme:

@enumerate
@item Match with the complete host name

@item Match with the realm name

@item Look for the Access object named @code{anyone}
@end enumerate

If a corresponding object is found, then this object is used for the access
rights of the remote machine. The object named @code{anyone} is used for any
network request, for which a corresponding Access object can't be found.

The Access object type has only one parameter:

@table @code
@item Exec Object
This parameter can be used several times and specifies which Exec objects can
be activated from the remote machine. If you don't specify @emph{any} object
name, then the remote machine can activate @emph{all} Exec objects on your
machine.

@item Object list
This gadget shows the list of all objects of the current type. You can select
an object by clicking on its name. If you double-click one item, an edit
window will open.

@item Move object
When an object is selected, you can move it around in the list with these
gadgets. If you click on the @code{Sort} gadget, the items in the list will be
sorted alphabetically.

@item Manipulate object
These gadgets manipulate objects. The @code{New} gadget creates a new object of
the current type which is selected automatically. When you click on the
@code{Edit} gadget, an edit window for the selected object will open. With
the @code{Copy} gadget you can make a copy of the selected object. The
@code{Remove} gadget deletes the selected object.

@item Configuration
You have several choices to save the configuration. With the @code{Save}
gadget you can save the configuration permanently into the file
@file{ENVARC:ToolManager.prefs}. For a temporary change use the @code{Use}
gadget, which will save the configuration into the file
@file{ENV:ToolManager.prefs}. This file will not survive a machine reset. To
test the new configuration without leaving the editor, use the @code{Test}
gadget. The @code{Cancel} gadget will quit the editor without saving.

Each object type has a different edit window to set the object parameters. For
a detailed list of all object parameters see @ref{Objects}.

Every edit window has a string gadget for the object name. This name is
important, because it is used to reference this object. Note that there is
currently no builtin cross-reference. So if you change the name of an object
which is already referenced by another object, this reference will @emph{not}
be updated. You have to update this reference by hand.

The button gadgets in the edit windows open different types of requesters. You
can choose an item by clicking on it and pressing the @code{OK} gadget, or you
simply double-click it. To leave a requester without changes, use the
@code{Cancel} gadget. If you wish to clear a field which can only be choosen
by a requester, open the requester and press the @code{OK} gadget
@emph{without} selecting an item.

The edit windows for the object types Exec and Image have an additional
feature. You can simply drop an icon on them to set the parameters from this
icon.

@cindex ToolManager shared library interface

The ToolManager handler is embedded into a Amiga shared library. This library
offers several functions to create and manipulate ToolManager objects, so that
you can use them in your programs.

There are currently six functions available:

@table @code
@item AllocTMHandle()
In order to create ToolManager objects you must first allocate a TMHandle.
This handle stores all information about your objects and is used to reference
them. Note that the information stored in this handle is @emph{only}
accessable by the program which creates it.

@item FreeTMHandle()
This function frees a TMHandle and all ToolManager objects associated with it.
Each @code{AllocTMHandle()} must be matched with a @code{FreeTMHandle()}!

@item  CreateTMObjectTags()
@itemx CreateTMObjectTagList()
This function creates a ToolManager object. You must supply a name, the object
type and various tags for the object parameters. The name of the object is
important, as it is used to reference the object.

@item  ChangeTMObjectTags()
@itemx ChangeTMObjectTagList()
You can modify the parameters of a ToolManager object with this function. The
object state will be updated to reflect the new parameters. Note: Currently
Image objects can't be modified.

@item DeleteTMObject()
With this function you can delete a ToolManager object. If the object is
linked to other objects, these objects will be notified to update their
state.

@item QuitToolManager()
This function tells the ToolManager handler to quit as soon as possible.

@chapter How to define a Hot Key
@cindex Introduction to Hot Keys
@cindex Hot Keys
@cindex Reference: Hot Keys

This chapter describes how to define a Hot Key as an Input Description String,
which is then parsed by Commodities. Each time a Hot Key is activated
Commodities generates an event which is used by ToolManager to activate Exec
objects or to toggle Dock objects. A description string has the following
syntax:

@example
[<class>] @{[-][<qualifier>]@} [-][upstroke] [<key code>]
@end example

All keywords are case insensitive.

@code{class} describes the InputEvent class. This parameter is optional and
if it is missing the default @code{rawkey} is used. @xref{InputEvent classes}.

Qualifiers are ``signals'' that must be set or cleared by the time the Hot Key
is activated; otherwise no event will be generated. For each qualifier that
must be set you supply its keyword. All other qualifiers are expected to be
cleared by default. If you want to ignore a qualifier, just set a @code{-}
before its keyword. @xref{Qualifiers}.

Normally a Hot Key event is generated when a key is pressed. If the event
should be generated when the key is released, supply the keyword
@code{upstroke}. When both press and release of the key should generate an
event, use @code{-upstroke}.

The key code is depending on the InputEvent class. @xref{Key codes}.

@menu
* InputEvent classes::
* Qualifiers::
* Key codes::

Note: Choose your hot keys @emph{carefully}, because Commodities has a high
priority in the InputEvent handler chain (i.e.@: will override existing
definitions).

@appendix Most asked questions about ToolManager
@cindex Questions
@cindex Answers

Here are the answers to the most asked questions about ToolManager:

@itemize @minus
@item Why can't ToolManager create multiple ``Tools'' menus or sub-menus?

Multiple menus or sub-menus are currently not supported by the system software.
To create them, you have to @emph{hack} them into the system software, which
can result in an unstable system. I don't want to produce unstable software, so
I won't implement such a thing in ToolManager.

@item WB programs won't start, but all other exec types work fine.

ToolManager relies on the program @code{L:WBStart-Handler} to start WB
programs. There are two reasons, why ToolManager can't execute this program:

@itemize
@item The file @file{L:WBStart-Handler} doesn't exists. Please copy it from the
distribution archive.

@item The execute flag (e) isn't set on this file. Use the following command
to set this flag: @code{protect L:WBStart-Handler +e}
@end itemize

@item How can I create a horizontal dock window?

Just set the number of columns to the number of entries in the dock object.

@item How can I create an output window for CLI programs?

Output windows can be created by using the @code{CON:} device. Use the
following file name to create an auto-open window with a close gadget which
doesn't close after the program has quit:

@example
CON:10/10/640/100/Output-Window/AUTO/CLOSE/WAIT
@end example

The @code{CON:} device has many options, please consult your AmigaDOS manual
for further information.

@item How can I put the arguments in the middle of a CLI/Arexx command line?

Normally all arguments are appended to the command line. To insert the
arguments anywhere in the command line, ToolManager uses the same @code{[]}
syntax, which is used by the AmigaShell command @code{alias}. So for example

@example
Dir [] all
@end example

will insert all arguments before the keyword @code{all}.

@item How can I clear a link from a complex object to a simple object?

After pressing the ``xxx Object'' button just press the ``OK'' button
@emph{without} selecting an object. This means that you choosed no object, and
therefore the link will be cleared.

@item How can I create sub-docks?

You must use Exec objects of the type Dock. Put such objects in the entries of
your main dock and they will open/close the other docks.

@item ToolManager is dead after starting a Network command.

There is currently a problem with the network software, which doesn't timeout
local requests. So if your machine is called @code{Host1} and you have an Exec
object of the type Network with the command @code{Object@@Host1}, ToolManager
will run into a dead-lock when you activate it. Please use only names of remote
machines!
