ToolManager 2.0/2.1 History

05-Jun-92 - First alpha release

05-Jun-92 - library/rexx.c:
             * FIXED: Used RXFB_NOIO instead of RXFF_NOIO.
             * RXFF_STRING only works with the "REXX" port and NOT with the
               "AREXX" port. Possible bug in ARexx???

06-Jun-92 - library/execobj.c:
             * FIXED: Exec objects only worked, if TMOP_HotKey was set.

          - library/dockobj.c:
             * FIXED: Interpretation of TMOP_Vertical was reversed.
             * FIXED: Handling of TMOP_HotKey was totally broken.
             * FIXED: Didn't open workbench.library for AddAppWindow().

          - library/readiff.c:
             * ADDED: STORE & XOR methods in ANIM 5 are supported.
             * ADDED: Interleave 1 and Interleave 0(=2) & 2 are supported.

07-Jun-92 - library/dockobj.c:
             * FIXED: Played animation in dock window without images.

          - library/imageobj.c:
             * FIXED: Forgot to set NextImage to NULL for one picture anims.

          - Alpha 2

08-Jun-92 - Added Matthias Schelers SAS C stuff to the Programmers directory.
            Thanks Matthias!

          - library/dockobj.c:
             * ADDED: Smaller images are automatically centered.
             * ADDED: TMOP_Pattern for image docks (Reworked window design).
                      I hope you like the pattern
             * ADDED: Drag gadget in borderless windows is font-sensitive now.

          - Alpha 3

09-Jun-92 - library/dockobj.c:
             * Worked on the window parameters again *sigh*

10-Jun-92 - library/dockobj.c:
             * FIXED: Mouse centered docks are REALLY centered now.
             * ADDED: Docks without mouse centering remember last position.
             * ADDED: Only first click of a double click will activate a tool.
             * ADDED: TMOP_PopUp for popup docks.

          - Alpha 4

11-Jun-92 - library/dockobj.c:
             * FIXED: Forgot to add TMOP_PopUp to AppWindow message handling.

13-Jun-92 - library/hotkey.c: (New created)
             * After receiving my copy of the RKM Libraries I was able to
               track down a nasty bug in commodities.library. ParseIX() doesn't
               set the ix_QualMask field right, so mouse button qualifiers
               didn't work at all. I implemented a new version of HotKey(),
               which fixes this bug in most cases.

          - library/iconobj.c:
             * CHANGED: DiskObject structure creation (RKM Libraries p. 351)

          - library/imageobj.c:
             * CHANGED: timing for animation: a) 1/30 secs/pic in animation
                                              b) 1 second for last picture

14-Jun-92 - library/dockobj.c:
             * FIXED: Double click: Image could be left in selected state.

21-Jun-92 - library/execobj.c:
             * FIXED: Didn't generate a command line parameter for a WBArg that
                      pointed to the programs current directory. This one was a
                      leftover from TM 1.X. As a side effect, drawers don't
                      have a path seperator (':' or '/') appended anymore.

          - library/dockobj.c:
             * FIXED: Don't produce a gadget (in docks with TMOP_Images==FALSE)
                      for a tool entry if no link to an Exec object exists.

22-Jun-92 - First demo version of the configuration program finished. Play
            with it and tell me what you think of it. German users may try out
            the german catalog for the program. I still need a good translation
            for some texts...

          - Alpha 5

11-Jul-92 - library/dockobj.c:
             * CHANGED: Changed WA_AutoAdjust tag value to FALSE. The behaviour
                        of this tag has changed under V39.

12-Jul-92 - Reworked user interface & functionality of the configuration
            program.

          - library/config.c (new created)
             * Started to add config reading to library...

15-Jul-92 - prefs/soundwindow.c
             * FIXED: Wrong bit used for masking ARexx Port config parameter

          - prefs/imagewindow.c
             * ADDED: Strip trailing ".info" from file name

          - library/config.c
             * finished config reading

          - library/handler.c
             * ADDED: Notification & Re-reading of configuration file

             * StartToolManager: Load library and start handler
             * QuitToolManager : Set handler quit flag

          - Added Olaf 'Olsen' Barthels MANX Aztec C stuff to the Programmers
            directory. Thanks Olaf!

          - Added Klaus Melchiors icon (Prefs/Toolmanager & C/StartToolManager)
            Thanks Klaus!

          - Alpha 6

20-Jul-92 - library/readiff.c
             * FIXED: REALLY BAD BUG in IFF ANIM reader: It didn't check if
                      the offset to the plane data in the DLTA chunk was zero
                      (meaning: no changes for this plane). So it used data
                      where no data was and trashed memory. Thanks to Brian
                      Wright for supplying an example IFF ANIM file, which
                      triggered the bug.

          - Alpha 6.1 (emergency release to fix the ANIM bug)

21-Jul-92 - Added L/WBStart-Handler to the distribution

          - Added Martin Horneffers Oberon interfaces to the Programmers
            directory. Thanks Martin!

             * ADDED: When an object is removed, the top of ListView is set
                      to its predecessor.
             * FIXED: Double-click on two different objects now opens edit
                      window for second object.

          - prefs/filereq.c
             * FIXED: OK with no file selected doesn't return path anymore.

          - prefs/menuwindow.c
             * FIXED: Return on string gadget doesn't re-activate it.

          - prefs/imagewindow.c
             * FIXED: ".info" will be stripped AFTER clicking OK.

          - prefs/*window.c
             * FIXED: Removed possible "Memory freed twice" GURU.
             * FIXED: Fast double-click would open requesters twice. This would
                      lead to a GURU.

          - prefs/main.c
             * ADDED: Preferences program can only be executed ONCE. Second
                      invocation of the program will move the current window of
                      the first prefs program to front.

          - library/handler.c
             * FIXED: Config will NOT be read if library gets loaded by

          - prefs/iconwindow.c
             * FIXED: Position of icons relative to Workbench window now.

          - prefs/imagewindow.c
             * ADDED: Directory of last selected file will be saved and used
                      the next time a new image object is created.

04-Aug-92 - prefs/*window.c
             * ADDED: Wait pointer for inactive windows

          - prefs/main.c
             * ADDED: CurrentDir(NULL). Now the current directory of the
                      preferences program is the same as that of the
                      ToolManager handler process.

          - prefs/locale/toolmanager.cd
             * CHANGED: "HotKey" -> "Hot Key"

             * ADDED: WA_AutoAdjust for PopUp docks

          - library/handler.c
             * CHANGED: Broker port renamed from "ToolManager_new" to
                        "ToolManager". Be sure to remove TM 1.x or the port

          - prefs/movewindow.c
             * CHANGED: Window updates X/Y gadgets after a move now

            Thanks Tomi!

15-Aug-92 - library/dockobj.c

19-Aug-92 - library/dockobj.c
             * Worked on item select/deselect, several bugs removed.

          - prefs/*window.c & prefs/listreq.c
             * ADDED: WFLG_RMBTRAP for windows without menus

          - WBStartup/ToolManager.c

          - Beta 1

23-Aug-92 - library/hotkey.c
             * CHANGED: Back to original HotKey() code again. The new version
                        of commodities.library (38.11) fixes the ParseIX() bug.
                        NOTE: "rawmouse" events have changed in 38.11!
                              "rawmouse midbutton mouse_leftpress" is now
                              "rawmouse midbutton lbutton mouse_leftpress"

25-Aug-92 - Added Marc Schaefers translation file for Italian. Thanks Marc!

          - library/execobj.c
             * FIXED: Created a corrupted command line if file name contained
                      a space (e.g. "Ram Disk:test").

26-Aug-92 - locale/toolmanager.cd
             * ADDED: Translations for Exec/Image/Sound/Menu/Icon/Dock

          - prefs/mainwindow.c
             * Localized object type cycle gadget labels

29-Aug-92 - library/execobj.c
             * CHANGED: Delayed programs are explicitely started with
                        NO arguments now.

31-Aug-92 - prefs/button.c (new created)
             * Calculates an image for requester buttons

          - prefs/(exec|image|dock)window.c
             * CHANGED: Added image to requester buttons

01-Sep-92 - prefs/(main|docklist)window.c
             * Reworked the LISTVIEW code

03-Sep-92 - prefs/mainwindow.c
             * FIXED: After a sort the object gadgets were still enabled
                      although no object was selected.

          - Beta 2

05-Sep-92 - library/dockobj.c
             * CHANGED: ScreenToFront() will now only be used when a dock
                        window gets opened via HotKey. This will prevent
                        unnecessary screen switches on startup/config changes.

          - prefs/mainwindow.c
             * FIXED: Removed some LISTVIEW bugs.

          - Added Jürgen Weinelts M2Amiga stuff to the Programmers directory.
            Thanks Jürgen!

10-Sep-92 - library/dockobj.c
             * ADDED: Font for GadTools gadgets in text docks will now stay
                      open while the window is open. This prevents a strange
                      mis-feature (or bug??) in Intuition when you use a font
                      (which is NOT a resident or system font) in button
                      gadgets and CLOSE that font. If you now use flushlibs or
                      "avail flush" the font will be freed. After this a press
                      on a button gadget will CHANGE THE FONT in this gadget
                      because Intuition can't open the old font again (it uses
                      OpenFont() not OpenDiskFont()!).

11-Sep-92 - prefs/button.c
             * CHANGED: New 2 Button image design (Thanks to Olaf!)

13-Sep-92 - L/WBStart-Handler
             * new version of the handler (1.1)

          - Goodies/GetPubName
             * Added Mick Hohmanns tool.

21-Sep-92 - L/WBStart-Handler
             * new version of the handler (1.2)

          - Beta 3

22-Sep-92 - prefs/mainwindow.c
             * ADDED: Waitpointer for save & load operations
             * CHANGED: Save button: First write to ENVARC:ToolManager.prefs
                        and then copy it to ENV:ToolManager.prefs

          - */locale.c
             * OC_Version does work :-)

23-Sep-92 - prefs/main.c
             * Port priority set to -127

          - library/data.c
             * Set WindowPtr of handler process to NULL instead of -1

26-Sep-92 - ToolManager 2.0 RELEASE

11-Oct-92 - library/dockobj.c
             * FIXED: Didn't free GadTools menus

02-Dec-92 - prefs/main.c
             * FIXED: Didn't free DiskObject

          - prefs/execwindow.c
             * FIXED: Dropped project icons are now handled correctly

          - prefs/config.c
             * CHANGED: Clear "e" flags on config files

          - prefs & library
             * FIXED: workbench.library can be opened even if the Workbench
                      isn't running (ARGGGH!), so AddAppWindow() CAN fail.
                      Now you can REALLY use ToolManager without the WB.

          - library/data.c
             * CHANGED: {NP_CopyVars,FALSE} removed. Now aliases & variables
                        are copied from the parent process.

03-Dec-92 - include/libraries/toolmanager.h
             * CHANGED: TMET_Hook now 100 (was 3)
             * ADDED:   Two new exec types:
                         - TMET_Dock:    Command contains the name of the Dock
                                         window to toggle
                         - TMET_Network: Tell a ToolManager that is running on
                                         a remote machine to execute a command
                                         (Not yet implemented)

             NOTE: You MUST update your include files & binaries, if you have
                   used TMET_Hook!!!

          - library/(exec|dock)obj.c & library/objects.c
             * ADDED: Support for new exec type TMET_Dock

          - library/execobj.c
             * FIXED: Now only "[]" is replaced by the parameters NOT
                      "[<any chars>]" anymore.

06-Dec-92 - prefs/execwindow.c
             * ADDED: Support for new exec type TMET_(Dock|Network)

          - prefs/mainwindow.c
             * ADDED: Append for config files

08-Dec-92 - prefs/*window.c
             * ADDED: Most of the gadgets support a shortcut now. IMHO this
                      makes only sense for the main window, dock tools window
                      and the list requester, because the other windows have
                      string gadgets, which disturbs this feature.

             NOTE: Several locale strings have been changed for this feature.
                   Look out for the "_" character. The character after this is
                   the keyboard shortcut for the gadget. You can change the
                   shortcut, since the preferences program scans the locale
                   strings for the "_" char.
                   The shortcuts MUST be UNIQUE for a window!

             NOTE: There is a problem with the lowercase to uppercase
                   translation table for non-ASCII characters. So if a
                   short-cut works as uppercase, but not as lowercase
                   character (or vice versa), then send me a message!

11-Dec-92 - prefs/mainwindow.c
             * ADDED: Support for AppWindow

          - prefs/selectwindow.c (new created)
             * Handles AppMessages for the main window. Opens a window with
               5 choices for object creation.

          - prefs/(exec|image|menu|icon)window.c
             * ADDED: Support for selectwindow.c

          - locale/toolmanager.cd
             * temporary version number set to 90

          - library/dockobj.c & prefs/mainwindow.c
             * ADDED: Support for V39 NewLook menus

13-Dec-92 - library/(handler|execobj).c
             * ADDED: Support for new exec type TMET_Network. This is
                      partially UNTESTED up to now! To address a TM on a
                      remote machine use the following command syntax:

                          <exec object name> @ <remote host name>

             NOTE: If you use your local machine name as host name, TM will
                   run into a dead-lock. You have been WARNED!

14-Dec-92 - library/execobj.c
             * FIXED: Didn't check if network software is installed.

17-Dec-92 - 2.1 Beta 1

30-Dec-92 - prefs/gadget.c
             * FIXED: Shortcuts with characters >127 resulted in strange
                      behaviour...

05-Mar-93 - Recompiled with DICE 2.07.54R, pragmas & 3.0 Includes.

14-Mar-93 - prefs/*window.c
             * ADDED: String edit hook. Now you can use the keyboard short-
                      cuts in active string gadgets by pressing the right
                      Amiga key.
             * ADDED: More keyboard short-cuts
             * ADDED: Cycle gadgets/Radio buttons: SHIFT-<Short-Cut> now
                      cycles backward.

          - prefs/mainwindow.c
             * FIXED: Fast clicking on two different items opened the edit
                      window for the second item.

          - prefs & library
             * ADDED: Exec object type "HotKey". This exec object creates
                      an input event from the command name. Finally we have
                      the universal keymap translator :-)

          - prefs/dockobj.c
             * FIXED: Frontmost docks only open on the currently active screen
                      (this screen must be of course a public screen!).

17-Mar-93 - library/dockobj.c
             * FIXED: TM crashed *REAL* badly when you activated a dock entry
                      which was linked to an Exec object that closed the dock.
                      TM closed the dock while the entry was still active. Now
                      the closing is defered until the activation of the entry
                      is finished.
                      Thanks to Andreas Harrenberg for reporting this bug!

27-Mar-93 - library & prefs
             * ADDED: Two new flags for dock windows:
                       - Backdrop: The dock will be moved to the back after
                                   opening.
                       - Sticky: The dock doesn't remember its new position
                                 when it is closed. It will always try to open
                                 on the position, which the user specified.
          - prefs/main.c
             * ADDED: 4 new tooltypes:
                       - XPOS/YPOS: Position of the main window
                       - MINLISTCOLUMNS/MINLISTROWS:
                           Minimum number of columns and rows for the
                           ListView gadgets.

          - prefs/*window.c
             * ADDED: Scaled checkboxes & MX buttons under V39.

          - prefs/window.c
             * ADDED: Uses now SetWindowPointer() for busy pointer under V39.

          - prefs/docklistwindow.c
             * FIXED: When you cleared the Exec object link in a dock entry,
                      the ListView gadget produced an Enforcer Hit.

          - library/dockobj.c
             * ADDED: Sanity checks on number of columns. Some strange things
                      happened when you had set the number of columns to -1...

          - locale/toolmanager.cd
             * temporary version number set to 91

28-Mar-93 - prefs
             * ADDED: When another window is opened, the old window sets up
                      a requester, which blocks ALL input to the old window.

          - library/accessobj.c (new created)
             * This code handles the new TM object type "Access". Access
               objects control the network access rights for TM. When TM
               receives a network request, it first tries to get the host name
               of the sender machine. It then uses this name to find an Access
               object. It uses the following algorithm:

                if (Got host name) {
                 <Search the Access object named "host name">
                  /* Access rights for a network request from specific mach. */
                  /* This can either be 'hostname' or 'realmname:hostname' */

                 if (Object not found) {
                   <Extract realm part from host name>
                   <Search the Access object named "realmname")
                    /* Access rights for a network request from a machine   */
                    /* from a specific realm. The name has NO ':' appended! */
                 }
                }
                if (Object not found)
                  <Search the Access object named "anyone">
                   /* Default access rights for EVERY network request */

               If TM has found the Access object, it activates the object and
               supplies the Exec object name as parameter. If no object can be
               found, the request will be aborted with an error code.

               Access objects maintain a list of Exec objects. If this list is
               empty, then the access is NOT checked on activation, that means
               TM just searches the Exec object and activates it. Therefore you
               can allow free access from any single machine or every machine
               of a specific realm or every machine on the network by creating
               an Access object with an empty list and the name of that machine
               or that realm or "anyone".

               If the list is NOT empty, the object compares the name of the
               Exec object with every entry on the list. Only if the name cna
               be found on the list, then the Exec object will be activated.
               Therefore you can restrict access to some specified Exec objects.

               NOTE: Only global Exec objects may be on Access object lists,
                     because TM can't know to which TMHandle a network request
                     was sent. So Access objects are useless for users of the
                     TM library interface.

          - includes & prefs/(handler|objects|config).c
             * ADDED: Support for Access objects.

29-Mar-93 - prefs/*window.c
             * String edit hook code reworked

          - prefs/accesswindow.c (new created)
             * Handles Access object edit window

          - locale/deutsch.ct
             * updated & enhanced

29-Mar-93 - 2.1 Beta 2

31-Mar-93 - prefs/*window.c
             * CHANGED: String gadget length changed from 100 to 256 bytes.

          - prefs/gadget.c
             * CHANGED: Keyboard shortcut qualifier changed from Right-Amiga
                        to Right-Alt.

          - Year in version strings changed from 1993 to 93.

          - prefs/accesswindow.c
             * ADDED: Button for name gadget and host name requester.

          - locale/toolmanager.cd
             * temporary version number set to 92

01-Apr-93 - prefs/mainwindow.c
             * FIXED: Shift-O short-cut switched from Exec to Dock instead of
                      Access.

02-Apr-93 - prefs/*window.c
             * Removed string edit hook. It just didn't work well this way.
               Now you have to press RETURN to deactivate a string gadget
               and then you can use the keyboard shortcut. The TAB cycle for
               string gadgets still works of course...

03-Apr-93 - prefs/listreq.c
             * FIXED: Didn't use values from MINLISTCOLUMNS/MINLISTROWS

03-Apr-93 - 2.1 Beta 3

07-Apr-93 - prefs/accesswindow.c
             * FIXED: Didn't enable the "Remove" gadget after adding an item
                      to the list.

15-May-93 - Recompiled with DICE 3.0 Beta 4

15-May-93 - ToolManager 2.1 RELEASE
