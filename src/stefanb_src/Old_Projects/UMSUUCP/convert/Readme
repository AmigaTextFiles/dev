SYNOPSIS: ConvAUUCPNews Node/A

ConvAUUCPNews imports a news database from  the  AmigaUUCP  package  into
UMS. This database normally resides in  UUNEWS:.  The  script  needs  one
parameter, the name of your primary polling host. It will import all news
articles under this user name. Set "uucp.keepdupes" to "N",  because  the
script doesn't look out for crossposted messages.

Be sure that T: points to a directory with enough space for the temporary
script file. This file will contain roughly 150-250 Bytes for  each  news
article in your UUNEWS: news database.

SYNOPSIS: rx ConvAUUCPMail <Node> <User>

The ARexx script ConvAUUCPNews imports an AmigaUUCP mail folder into UMS.
These folders normally reside in UUMAIL:,  e.g.  UUMAIL:jduser  for  user
"jduser". The script needs two  parameters,  the  name  of  your  primary
polling host and the user name. It will import the  mail  folder  of  the
user under the user name of your primary polling host.

NOTE: The scripts don't read the AmigaUUCP configuration! They use the
      assigns UUSPOOL:, UUNEWS: and UUMAIL:.
