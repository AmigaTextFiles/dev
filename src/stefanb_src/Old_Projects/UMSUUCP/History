          - New environment variable "UMSUUCP.mb" for message base name.
          - Partial support for RFC 1342 (Non-US-ASCII RFC 822 Headers).
          - Partial support for RFC 1341 (MIME, quoted-printable encoding).

15-Nov-92 - umsuucp V0.2

18-Nov-92 - Added missing "UserName" line to lib/config

23-Nov-92 - Didn't leave nextgroup loop in rnews.c if UMS error occured
          - Improved error logging in rnews.c/rbsmtp.c

16-Dec-92 - Error logging completely rewritten. Now all errors are logged and
            the complete log is send as mail to "postmaster"

16-Dec-92 - umsuucp V0.3

19-Dec-92 - uuxqt now puts an id string at the beginning of the comments.
            ums2uucp needs this to detect messages from other system.

21-Dec-92 - ums2uucp: News export should be working now. No MIME, No
                      hard-linked news articles (crosspostings).

22-Dec-92 - ums2uucp: Mail export added.

30-Dec-92 - ums2uucp: Removed stupid bug in reading reply msg ID.
          - ums2uucp: Added "X-NewsReader:" field (UMSCODE_NewsReader)

31-Dec-92 - umsuucp V0.4

27-Feb-93 - uuxqt: RFC header lines which contained only the keyword and no
                   white space after the ":" (e.g. "Lines:\n") confused the
                   parser.

28-Feb-93 - uuxqt: Added "Originator:" as a synonym for "From:"
          - uuxqt: Messages with no sender name/address will be set to
                   "Unknown" and "unknown@nowhere"
          - ums2uucp: Fixed Refer ID generation
          - ums2uucp: Fixed multiple export of non-local crossposted messages
          - ums2uucp: Added support for local crossposted messages
                      (Does any UMS newsreader generate crosspostings yet?)
                      Only MIME support left to do...
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: New UMS config var uucp.pathname. If your node name
                            is NOT registered in the UUCP maps, you MUST set
                            this variable to your domain name, otherwise to
                            your registered node name. This is used to generate
                            the "Path:" lines.
          - Added support for new UMS message fields: ReplyName, ReplyAddr,
            ReplyGroup (Followup-To).

28-Feb-93 - umsuucp V0.5

15-Mar-93 - ums2uucp: Fixed a bad bug in the exporting of local messages.
                      AmigaDOS and UNIX have different time epochs, but I
                      didn't correct the difference, so all messages had a date
                      stamp that was 8 years behind the current date.

15-Mar-93 - umsuucp V0.5a

04-Apr-93 - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Fixed handling of "\n." in BSMTP messages
          - ums2uucp: Exits if no system name is specified
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Rewrote UUCP envelope handling. Envelopes are NOT
                            stored in the comments anymore. They are ignored on
                            import and are created on export.
          - ums2uucp: New UMS config var "uucp.dumbhost". If your mail host
                      uses outdated UUCP software and needs the RFC976 envelope
                      format, set this variable to "Y".
          - uuxqt: rmail didn't clear the TOPATH field when it received a mail
                   for a local user (rmail user). This should fix the need for
                   many AKA lines in the UMS config.

04-Apr-93 - umsuucp V0.6

07-Apr-93 - ums2uucp: Corrected "Organisation" to "Organization"

18-Apr-93 - created lib/.seq. It is NOT created automatically :-(
          - updated documentation for UMS Server V10.

13-Jun-93 - ums2uucp: Fixed infinite loop while scanning hardlinks. This
                      requires at least an umsserver>=10.12!
          - Ported (n)compress, freeze & gzip
          - uuxqt: Now you can give the system name on the command line.
                   If a system name ist specified, uuxqt tries to scan the
                   directory with the same name in the UUSPOOL: directory.
          - uuxqt: Refined error levels. Now all UMS errors>=300 are fatal
                   and cause uuxqt to abort processing.
          - uuxqt: New UMS config var "uucp.keepdupes". If you want to keep
                   jobs which contain dupes, then set this variable to "Y".
          - uuxqt: If a directory "bad-jobs" exists in the spool directory
                   for the system, then all jobs with errors are moved to this
                   directory. Otherwise the old X.* -> E.* renaming is used.
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Support for zipped files added.
          - ums2uucp: Added "X-Mailer:" field for mails (UMSCODE_NewsReader)
          - ums2uucp: Sub directories in the UUSPOOL: directory (see above)
          - ums2uucp: If the attribute "fileattach" is set, it will use the
                      subject line as a file name and append the contents of
                      this file uuencoded to the message.
          - started to rewrite documentation

20-Jun-93 - ums2uucp: Now tries to build a complete "Reference:" line.
          - uuxqt: Now sets the attribute "MIME" if it could decode a MIME
                   messages successfully.
          - ums2uucp: Now creates MIME headers.

27-Jun-93 - uuxqt: Improved SplitAddress(). Now detects quoted characters and
                   strings. Stops parsing when a "," is encountered.
          - uuxqt: More robust parsing of the "Newsgroups:" line.
          - uuxqt: Mails to multiple recipients are correctly handled now.
          - uuxqt: Corrupt Msg-Ids are stored in the comments
          - uuxqt: Added handling of "Content-Length:"
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Changed handling of "In-Reply-To:"
          - ums2uucp: Real names are now always enclosed in ""
          - ums2uucp: New option "-b". This specifies the bit number of an
                      additional select bit in the user flags.
          - Finished new documentation

27-Jun-93 - umsuucp V0.7

11-Sep-93 - uuxqt: Dupe-Mails are now checked if the recipients are different.
                   If they are different, the new message is stored as
                   soft-link to the original message.
          - uuxqt: Only a correct Refer-ID from "References:" will be used.
          - uuxqt: Added support for control messages with cancel command.
                   uuxqt tries to delete the specified message. Control
                   messages are only visible to exporters.
          - uuxqt: Added "X-Mailer:"/"X-NewsReader:" headers.
          - ums2uucp: Added missing "Distribution:" header for local news
                      messages.

12-Sep-93 - ums2uucp: "Reply-To:" with real name enclosed in ""'s now.
          - ums2uucp: Mails to multiple users, that is mails which are
                      soft-linked together, are now supported. ums2uucp will
                      create a "To:" line with multiple recipients. If the
                      mail transfer is not batched, ums2uucp will "optimize"
                      the transfer by issuing a rmail command with multiple
                      recipients.

13-Sep-93 - ums2uucp: Reworked the handling of UMSExportedMsg().
          - ums2uucp: "To:" with real name enclosed in ""'s now.

18-Sep-93 - uuxqt: Reworked dupe check for mails.

19-Sep-93 - ums2uucp: Doesn't add the user name to the "Path:" line on local
                      messages anymore. According to RFC1036 this is an
                      optional feature to maintain upward compatibility to
                      older systems, which use the "Path:" line incorrectly as
                      reply address.
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Support for mail with multiple recipients in BSMTP
                            added.
          - ums2uucp: Messages with non-empty from address can now be exported.
                      NOTE: No address or date conversion takes place (yet)!!!

27-Sep-93 - ums2uucp: Some news systems can't cope with a "Path:" line without
                      a user name. Now a dummy user name "news" is added.
          - ums2uucp: ReplyAddr/Name now goes through address conversion too.

03-Oct-93 - uuxqt: Added UUCP commands crsmtp,frsmtp, grsmtp and zrsmtp.
                   Updated documentation.
          - gzip: Ported new version 1.2.4

11-Oct-93 - ums2uucp: Added address conversion for Maus/Z-Netz/Fidonet
          - ums2uucp: ToAddr/ToName now goes through address conversion too.

22-Oct-93 - ums2uucp: "Distribution:", "Followup-To:", "X-Mailer:",
                      "X-NewsReader:" were created twice.
          - ums2uucp: Recipient addresses in "C rmail"/"RCPT TO:" lines go
                      through address conversion too.
          - ums2uucp: Corrected the Z-Netz and Fidonet address conversion.
          - ums2uucp: New news/mail export command syntax:
                       "<xcmd> , <batch> , <compcmd> , <dhdr> ,<max size>"
                      e.g. uucp.newsexport = rnews,Y,compress,cunbatch,200000
                           uucp.mailexport = rmail,N
                           uucp.mailexport = rgbsmtp,Y,gzip,,200000

23-Oct-93 - ums2uucp: Now creates R and Z commands in the UUCP command file
          - ums2uucp: Domain name for Fidonet is now configurable. New UMS
                      config var "uucp.fidodomain" (Default: fidonet.org).
          - ums2uucp: Now reads time zone from Locale.

24-Oct-93 - uuxqt: Command file parsing and data file handling rewritten. The
                   type of the data file is now automagically recognized.
          - uuxqt: Added address conversion for Maus/Z-Netz/Fidonet.

15-Nov-93 - uuxqt: SplitAddress() accepts '_' and '.' as replacement for ' '
                   in real names now.
          - uuxqt: Parsing of Fidonet addresses more robust now.
          - uuxqt: Now reads real name of recipient for incoming mails.
          - ums2uucp: Fixed retrieving of "uucp.username".

17-Nov-93 - ums2uucp: Now checks the old flag of a soft-linked message. Only
                      unread messages are exported again.

20-Nov-93 - ums2uucp: UMS config var "uucp.fidodomain" removed.
          - ums2uucp: New UMS config vars "uucp.export.(fido|maus|zer)". They
                      specify the domain names for the nets.

                      Defaults:
                       Fidonet: uucp.export.fido "fidonet.org"
                       Maus   : uucp.export.maus "maus.de"
                       Z-Netz : uucp.export.zer  "zer.sub.org"

          - ums2uucp: UMS config var "8bitclean" removed (was never used).
          - ums2uucp: New UMS config var "uucp.encoding". Legal values for
                      this var are "8bit" and "binary". Use "binary" if you
                      can't assure that the line length of your messages
                      never exceeds 1000 characters. Default: "8bit".
          - ums2uucp: New UMS config var "uucp.mailroute" (Default: <none>).
                      You can now specify explicit mail routes. Each line in
                      this variable does contain an address pattern and a list
                      of hosts:

                       <address pattern> [<host1>[,<host2>....]]

                      When the recipient address matches the address pattern
                      and the host list is not empty, then ums2uucp will create
                      an explicit mail route. The route information will be
                      added AFTER the address conversion for Fidonet, Maus and
                      Z-Netz has been applied.

                      If the variable does contain several lines, then the
                      patterns will be tried from the first line down to the
                      last line until one pattern matches. If no pattern
                      matches, then no route information will be generated.

                      Example:
                       uucp.mailroute = "#?.maus.de  host1
                       #?.zer.sub.org                host2,host3
                       #?.fidonet.org
                       #?.de                         host4"

                      Test cases:
                       user@box.maus.de
                       user@box.zer.sub.org
                       user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org
                       user@zauber.nase.de
                       user@dummy.blubb.edu

                      These will be transformed to the following mail routes:
                       - RMail: C rmail host1!box.maus.de!user
                                C rmail host2!host3!box.zer.sub.org!user
                                C rmail user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org
                                C rmail host4!zauber.nase.de!user
                                C rmail user@dummy.blubb.edu
                       - BSMTP: RCPT TO: <@host1:user@box.maus.de>
                                RCPT TO: <@host2,@host3:user@box.zer.sub.org>
                                RCPT TO: <user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org>
                                RCPT TO: <@host4:user@zauber.nase.de>
                                RCPT TO: <user@dummy.blubb.edu>

21-Nov-93 - uuxqt: New UMS config vars "uucp.import.(fido|maus|zer)". They
                   specify which domain names uuxqt should recognize for the
                   nets. Each variable does contain a comma seperated list of
                   domains. If the list is empty, then uuxqt does not perform
                   an address conversion for the net.

                   Example:
                    uucp.import.maus = ".maus.de,.maus.sub.org"

                   With this entry, uuxqt will recognize "A_B@HB.maus.de" and
                   "A_B@HB.maus.sub.org" as Maus addresses and convert them
                   to the UMS address format for the Maus net (Name: "A B",
                   Address: "HB.maus").

                   Defaults:
                    Fidonet: uucp.import.fido ".fidonet.org"
                    Maus   : uucp.import.maus ".maus.de"
                    Z-Netz : uucp.import.zer  ".zer.sub.org"

          - ums2uucp: The format for the UMS config vars "uucp.export.*" has
                      changed. They now have a '.' at the beginning too, just
                      like the corresponding UMS config vars "uucp.import.*".

                      Defaults:
                       Fidonet: uucp.export.fido ".fidonet.org"
                       Maus   : uucp.export.maus ".maus.de"
                       Z-Netz : uucp.export.zer  ".zer.sub.org"

20-Nov-93 - ums2uucp: Did not create "DATA" line in front of the mail data for
                      batched mail transfers.

26-Nov-93 - uuxqt: Removed change from 15-Nov-93. Now the recipient address
                   is used again for incoming mail.
          - Revised documentation to include all new features.

27-Nov-93 - Reformatted documentation
          - Added a chapter about "Leaf node/Full node/Gateway" setup.

01-Dec-93 - umsuucp V0.8

29-Jan-94 - ums2uucp: New UMS config var "uucp.recipients". This variable
                      specifies the maximum number of recipients which are
                      exported in one mail for multi-recipient mails. Set this
                      variable to the maximum number of recipients which your
                      host node can handle in one mail.

                      NOTE: If a mail has more recipients than this limit,
                            then it has to be exported several times!

                      Example:
                       uucp.recipients = 2
                        - mail with 2 recipients: exported once
                        - mail with 5 recipients: exported 3 (2/2/1) times

                      Default: 4294967295 (virtually unlimited)

01-Feb-94 - ums2uucp: Meaning of UMS config var "uucp.encoding" changed. It
                      is now a number which specifies the transfer encoding
                      type:

                        0 - no encoding (default)
                        1 - quoted-printable
                        2 - base64 (not yet implemented)

                      Use 0 if the link to the host is 8-Bit clean, otherwise
                      1 (or 2 in the future).

03-Feb-94 - ums2uucp: Fixed quoted-printable encoding for BSMTP

05-Feb-94 - ums2uucp: The local command files are created with temporary file
                      names before starting a UUCP job. After a job has been
                      created sucessfully, the command file will be renamed
                      to the final "C." form.

27-Feb-94 - ums2uucp: A '.' wasn't qouted for BSMTP if it was the first
                      character of the message text.
          - uuxqt: Fixed recognition of RFC keywords, e.g. "DateXYZ" is not
                   recognized as "Date" anymore.
          - uuxqt: New UMS config var "uucp.filtercr". If this variable is set
                   to "Y", then all CR (=13) characters are removed before
                   processing the messages. Default: N

31-Mar-94 - uuxqt: If the message text was zero bytes long (that is the message
                   consisted only of the header and one empty line) the pointer
                   to the message text in the UMS tags was pointing one byte
                   after the string terminator. So UMS tried to read and read
                   and read... :-(

05-Apr-94 - uuxqt: If a quoted printable text did end with a '=', the string
                   terminator was skipped (result see above :-( ).
          - Fixed some source code lines which caused warning messages from
            DICE 3.0

17-May-94 - ums2uucp: Added support for LogicalToName/Addr
          - ums2uucp: If the UMS config var "uucp.username" is missing for an
                      user, ums2uucp will still issue an error message, but it
                      will build an address with the name "UNKNOWN"
          - uuxqt: Fixed CR filter for news batches

05-Jun-94 - uuxqt: "Filesystem full" is now a fatal error
          - uuxqt: If a news message couldn't be written to any newsgroup (that
                   is no write access to any group) then a warning message is
                   written to the log. The command and data file will not be
                   deleted.
          - uuxqt: No longer sets the return code to 20 when no files can be
                   found
          - uuxqt: All control messages are written to the group "rfc.control".
                   This prevents the creation of dummy "control" groups and
                   allows the controlled export of control messages to other
                   nodes.
          - uuxqt: Support for new V11 field MsgCDate added
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Fixed handling of messages without "Date:" field
