NAME
	UULIB:Security

SYNOPSIS
	-

DESCRIPTION
	The UULIB:Security file governs readability and writability
	of directories relative to remote uucp requests.  The UUSPOOL:
	directory is always readable and writable.

	This prevents other nodes from examining or overwriting
	arbitrary files in your system.

	The UUCICO program, which does the actual work downloading
	and uploading files, will check remote-requested paths
	against this file by comparing inodes (DOS Locks) and not
	by name.  The reason for this is simply that, on the Amiga,
	several different paths may refer to the same directory.

	Note that before 1.16 you had to specify all directories for which
	access was to be allowed, even sub directories of directories
	already specified.  As of 1.16 you need only specify the 'parent'
	directory and all sub directories will be allowed by default. So,
	for example, if you allow UUPUB: then people would be able to
	access UUPUB:fubar, UUPUB:mydir/abcd, etc... where previously they
	would have not had access to UUPUB:mydir/...


		    ---- Example Security file (this line not included) ---

#   This file is used by UUCICO to determine the validity of requests.
#
#   The directories listed here are *allowed* directories for uucp
#   transfers.	The permissions field lists permissions
#		    r	-readable
#		    w	-writable

tmp:	    rw
uucp:c	    r
uucp:man    r
UUPUB:	    rw

# If you have a UUPUBW: assign that is *different* from UUPUB: then
# you might want to make UUPUB: readable only and UUPUBW: read-write.
