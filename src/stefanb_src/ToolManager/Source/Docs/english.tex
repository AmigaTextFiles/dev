@cindex Donations

ToolManager is @emph{GiftWare}, @strong{not} ShareWare!

So if you like the program and use it very often, you should consider to
send a little donation or gift to honor the work that I have put into
this program. I suggest a donation of US $10--$20 or 10--20 DM. Please
don't send cheques or money orders from outside Europe, because most
often cashing those items costs more than what they amount to.

If can't affort to send a donation you don't have to feel bad about it.
But you have to send me at least a postcard or letter saying that you are
using ToolManager (I like to get fan mail :-). @xref{Author}.

@chapter About the future of ToolManager
@cindex Future

Since the last major release of ToolManager 2.1 in May 1993 it has been a
troubled time for the Amiga and its user community. At the time of this
writing the future still doesn't look too optimistic. Despite of this I
have decided to develop a new version of ToolManager 3.0, because of
the enormous feedback I got from hundreds of satisfied users.

My trustworthy A3000 is now getting old and with the current situation it
is uncertain which direction the Amiga will take. I can't afford to buy
every upgrade or any of the (eventually) new machines, because this
project is only my hobby. Thus it depends on your feedback and donations
if I'm able to work on future versions of ToolManager.

This is also a call to the companies which are working on the future Amigas
(Amiga Technologies, Phase5, ProDAD, VisCorp or whoever is currently involved).
I'm only a FD author and can't afford to buy every possible system or to pay
the developer material for every system. So I need your support if you wan't to
see ToolManager running on your system. Remember that ToolManager is one of (if
not @strong{the}) most-used tools on the Amiga and therefore it will be a bonus
for your system.

The future of ToolManager depends on @emph{YOUR} support!

@chapter Concepts behind ToolManager
@cindex Concepts

ToolManager is a program which lets you start your tools in a very easy way.
You can start programs by using keyboard shortcuts (@pxref{Hotkeys}), by
selecting an entry from the Workbench's Tools menu or by clicking an icon
either on the Workbench or in special dock windows. You can even drag icons
from Workbench drawers on those icons to supply files to the programs.
Additionally you can attach a sound to each of these actions.

All these things are controlled by ToolManager objects. Each object has a
specific task and contains information how to accomplish this task. F.ex.
programs are represented as Exec objects and contain information about the
program name and the stack size.

There are two types of objects. The object types Exec, Image and Sound are
called basic objects, because they only contain information about one program,
one image and one sound.

The object types Menu, Icon and Dock are called compound objects, because they
bind several basic objects together to perform their tasks. F.ex. an icon on
the Workbench is represented by an Icon object which has a link to an Image
object for the icon imagery and a link to an Exec object which will start a
program when the icon is activated.

@menu
* Exec objects::    Programs
* Image objects::   Images
* Sound objects::   Sounds
* Menu objects::    Entries in the Workbench Tools menu
* Icon objects::    Icons in the Workbench window
* Dock objects::    Button windows

@section Programs
@cindex Exec objects

An Exec object contains information about a program which is started when the
object is activated. The object can be activated directly by the user using a
@ref{Hotkeys, hotkey} or through a compund object. On activation a set of files
can be supplied which are forwarded to the program as startup parameters. Exec
objects are configured with the @ref{ExecWindow, Exec object edit window}.

ToolManager can execute different kinds of programs:

@table @asis
@item Shell
The program is executed as shell program just as the user had typed in the
command line into the shell. Shell scripts have to be started in this mode. You
can use the usual @file{[]} place holders to specify where the file arguments
should be placed on the command line.

@item Workbench
A start from the Workbench is simulated. All files are supplied as Workbench
arguments. Shell-only programs and shell scripts will not work when started as
Workbench program.

@item ARexx
An ARexx script or command is executed.

@item Dock
The command specifies a ToolManager Dock object which should be activated. You
can use this program type to create docks which are embedded in other docks.

@item Hotkey
A hotkey is generated. This might be used to control another program from
ToolManager.

@section Images
@cindex Image objects

An Image object contains information about an image which is used by a compund
object. ToolManager can load Workbench icons which are used by @ref{Icon
objects}. When a @ref{Dock objects, Dock object} uses an Image object the data
is loaded using the DataTypes system. Thus ToolManager can use every image for
which you have a valid datatype installed on your system. Image objects are
configured with the @ref{ImageWindow, Image object edit window}.

A Menu object is a compound object which binds an @ref{Exec objects, Exec
object} and a @ref{Sound objects, Sound object} together to create an entry in
the Workbench Tools menu. Whenever this menu entry is selected the Exec object
and the Sound object are activated. Every selected icon on the Workbench is
used as startup parameter for the program. Menu objects are configured with the
@ref{MenuWindow, Menu object edit window}.

An Icon object is a compound object which binds an @ref{Exec objects, Exec

object} together to create an icon in the Workbench window. The Image object is
used to create the icon image. Icon objects are configured with the
@ref{IconWindow, Icon object edit window}.

Icons can be activated in two ways. The user can double-click the icon or he
can select icons on the Workbench and drop them on the icon. Whenever the icon
is activated the Exec object and the Sound object are activated. The icons
which have been dropped onto the icon are used as startup parameter for the
program.

@section Button windows
@cindex Dock objects

A Dock object is a compound object which presents a window with button rows to
the user. Each button binds an @ref{Exec objects, Exec object}, an @ref{Image
objects, Image object} and a @ref{Sound objects, Sound object} together. Each
button can display either a text, an image or both. The name of the Exec object
is used for the text. The Image object is used to for the image. Dock objects
are configured with the @ref{DockWindow, Dock object edit window}.

Each button can be activated in two ways. The user can click on the button or
he can select icons on the Workbench and drop them on the button. Whenever the
icon is activated the Exec object and the Sound object are activated. The
selected icons are used as startup parameter for the program.

A Dock object can be ``activated'' with a @ref{Hotkeys, hotkey}. When the dock
window is closed and the user enters the hotkey then the dock window is opened
and vice versa.

If the @file{screennotify.library} is installed then ToolManager can open and
close dock windows automatically. Every time a screen is going to be closed all
dock windows on this screen are closed first. When the public screen opens
again all dock windows for this screen are opened again.

@node MainWindow, ExecWindow, , Preferences
@section The main window

The main window contains the object lists. By clicking on the object type you
can select which list is currently visible. Each list can contain several
groups. Each group can hold several objects.

A double-click on the name of a group opens the @ref{GroupWindow, group edit
window}. Clicking on the symbol left to the group name opens and closes the
group. If a group is open you can see all the objects in this group. A
double-click on the name of an object opens the object edit window.

To move a group you first select one, drag it to the new position
while holding the left mouse button and then release the mouse button.
You can also move objects between groups with this method.

Attached to the list are four buttons:

@table @asis
@item New Group
Creates a new empty group. The @ref{GroupWindow, group edit window} will open
so that you can set the name of the new group.

@item New Object
Create a new object in the selected group. The object edit window will open so
that you can edit the properties of the new object.

@item Delete
Deletes the selected group or object. If a group is selected also all objects
in this group will be deleted.

@item Sort
If an object or an open group is selected then the contents of this group are
sorted alphabetically. Otherwise the groups are sorted alphabetically.
@end table

With the buttons at the bottom of the main window you can tell the preferences
editor where to store the configuration. The name of the configuration file is
@file{ToolManager.prefs}.

@table @asis
@item Save
Store the configuration to @file{ENVARC:} and @file{ENV:}. The new
configuration will be taken into use automatically and survive a reboot. After
storing the preferences editor exits.

@item Use
Store the configuration to @file{ENV:}. The new configuration will be taken
into use automatically but it will @emph{not} survive a reboot. After storing
the preferences editor exits.

@item Test
Store the configuration to @file{ENV:}. The new configuration will be taken
into use automatically but it will @emph{not} survive a reboot. The preferences
editor does not exit.

@item Cancel
The preferences editor exits. All changes which have not been saved will be
discarded.

@appendix How to define a Hotkey
@cindex Introduction to Hotkeys
@cindex Hotkeys

This chapter describes how to define a Hotkey as an Input Description String,
which is then parsed by Commodities. Each time a Hotkey is activated
Commodities generates an event which is used by ToolManager to activate Exec
objects or to toggle Dock objects. A description string has the following
syntax:

@example
[<class>] @{[-][<qualifier>]@} [-][upstroke] [<key code>]
@end example

All keywords are case insensitive.

@code{class} describes the InputEvent class. This parameter is optional and
if it is missing the default @code{rawkey} is used. @xref{InputEvent classes}.

Qualifiers are ``signals'' that must be set or cleared by the time the Hotkey
is activated; otherwise no event will be generated. For each qualifier that
must be set you supply its keyword. All other qualifiers are expected to be
cleared by default. If you want to ignore a qualifier, just set a @code{-}
before its keyword. @xref{Qualifiers}.

A Hotkey event is usually generated when a key is pressed. If the event
should be generated when the key is released, supply the keyword
@code{upstroke}. When both press and release of the key should generate an
event, use @code{-upstroke}.

The key code is depending on the InputEvent class. @xref{Key codes}.

@menu
* InputEvent classes::
* Qualifiers::
* Key codes::
* Hotkey examples::
@end menu

Note: Choose your Hotkeys @emph{carefully}, because Commodities has a high
priority in the InputEvent handler chain, i.e.@: it will override existing
definitions.

@appendix Frequently asked questions

Here are the answers to the most asked questions about ToolManager:

@itemize @minus
@item When I start the ToolManager preferences editor only a requester
with the text ``Program initialization failed'' appears. What's wrong?

The preferences editor checks the basic requirements before opening the
first window. Please check that these @ref{Requirements, requirements}
are fulfilled! Your system might also be running out of memory. You may
have to quit some other applications first before enough memory is
available to run the ToolManager preferences editor. Also there can be
only one preferences editor running at one time.

@item How can I run the ToolManager preferences editor on another public
screen than the Workbench screen?

Select the entry @code{MUI...} from the settings menu in the
@ref{MainWindow, main window} menu. Now select the @code{System} settings
page and enter the name of the public screen into the string gadget. For
further details please consult the @ref{MUI} documentation.

@item After converting my old ToolManager 2.x configuration some pictures
are missing in the dock windows and some dock windows don't appear at
all!

ToolManager 3.1 only supports picture files in dock windows which can be
accessed via the picture.datatype. In your old configuration you have
attached some Image objects to the Dock objects which refer to icon
files. In order to use icon files you have to install an icon datatype on
your system. You may find such a datatype e.g.@: on the Aminet. You can
also convert them to e.g. IFF Brushes.

@item After converting my old ToolManager 2.x configuration some of the
icons in the Workbench window are missing!

ToolManager 3.1 only supports icons files for Icon objects. In your old
configuration you have attached some Image objects to the Icon objects
which refer to IFF Brushes. You have to convert them to icon files in
order to use them with ToolManager 3.1 Icon objects.

@item When I use icon files for images in the dock windows then there are
some addtional texts attached to the image or it has a thick border.
What's wrong?

You have installed an icon.datatype on your system which inserts
additional information from the icon into the image. Please check the
documentation of the icon.datatype how this information can be
suppressed. If you don't like the thick border you also have to tell the
icon.datatype not to generate the usual icon borders.

@item Why can't ToolManager create multiple ``Tools'' menus or sub-menus?

Multiple menus or sub-menus are currently not supported by the Workbench.
To create them, you have to @emph{hack} them into the AmigaOS, which can
result in an unstable system. Therefore I won't implement it in ToolManager.


@item How can I create a horizontal dock window?

Just set the number of columns to the number of entries in the dock object.


@item How can I create an output window for shell programs?

Output windows can be created by using the @code{CON:} device. Use the
following file name to create an auto-open window with a close gadget which
doesn't close after the program has quit:

@example
CON:10/10/640/100/Output-Window/AUTO/CLOSE/WAIT
@end example

The @code{CON:} device has many options, please consult your AmigaDOS manual
for further information.


@item How can I put the arguments in the middle of a Shell/Arexx command line?

Usually all arguments are appended to the command line. To insert the
arguments anywhere in the command line, ToolManager uses the same @code{[]}
syntax, which is used by the AmigaShell command @code{alias}. So for example

@example
Dir [] all
@end example

will insert all arguments before the keyword @code{all}.


@item How can I create sub-docks?

You must use Exec objects of the type Dock. Put such objects in the entries of
your main dock and they will open/close the other docks.


@item The dock windows disappear when the Workbench screen is closed and opened
again.

You have forgotten to set the public screen name for the dock window to
@code{Workbench}. ToolManager will close dock windows when the public screen
closes. But it has to know on which public screen the dock windows should
appear in order to open them automatically when the public screen opens again.
