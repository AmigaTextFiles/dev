03-Sep-96 ToolManager 3.0 Alpha 1

08-Sep-96 Prefs: - Started on preferences editor
                 - Started to implement main window class

14-Sep-96 Prefs: - Started to implemented base class for objects
                 - Started to implemented group class for config groups

15-Sep-96 Prefs: - ListTree: new group/object implemented
                 - ListTree: Drag & Drop implemented

19-Sep-96 Prefs: - MainWindow: Menus added, basic menu handling implemented

20-Sep-96 Libs:  - Added missing CloseIFF()
          Prefs: - Started to implement configuration handling
                 - Basic IFF parsing implemented, file can be scanned now

21-Sep-96 Prefs: - Started to implement Exec, Image, Sound, Menu, Icon, Dock
                   and Exec classes
                 - Added group and object creation to IFF parser

22-Sep-96 Prefs: - Implemented IFF writer. Due to a bug in the Listtree class
                   It can currently only write the first group in a list.
                 - Implemented file requester.
                 - Calls to configuration routines added for Save, Use and
                   Test Button.

23-Sep-96 Prefs: - Implemented Edit/Finish method for Base class.
                   There are some strange Enforcer-Hits though...

24-Sep-96 Prefs: - Replaced DisposeObject() calls with MUI_DisposeObject()
                 - Cancel/Use notification is now send to the ListTree which
                   then sends the TMM_Finish method to object. But still there
                   no progress with the Enforcer hits/crashes :-(

25-Sep-96 Prefs: - Before the application object is disposed the main window
                   object is removed from the application and disposed
                   separately. Now active objects (= window open) are only
                   disposed once, hence no crash anymore :-)
                 - Cancel/Use now push the method. No Hits anymore :-)
                 - Got a bug-fixed Listtree.mcc. Problems with Drag&Drop and
                   and List scanning are gone.
                 - Added basic IFF Read/Write code to each object class. Now
                   it is possible to read and write a complete configuration
                   file.
                 - Replaced MUIM_Listtree_FindNames with own scan routine. Now
                   loading several groups from the configuration file works.
                 - Implemented sort hook for Listtree
                 - Double click on Listtree entry starts editing
          Lib:   - Flags read from IFF chunk are masked so that only the valid
                   bits are copied to the object.
                 - Base clase used FreeMemory() instead of FreeVector() to free
                   the member data in the detach method, thus the wrong size
                   was used during deallocation.

26-Sep-96 Prefs: - The configuration will be loaded after the main window has
                   been opened
                 - Completed implementation for the Image class

27-Sep-95 Prefs: - Implemented subclass of Popasl.mui. The requester is now
                   modal for the window from which it was opened. Additionally
                   it can be checked if any ASL requesters are open. MainWindow
                   class now checks the open count before the program exits.
                 - Started to implement the PopScreen class

28-Sep-96 Prefs: - Completed implementation for the Sound class
                 - Application is put to sleep during configuration file read
                   and write.
                 - Added requester check to menu actions Open..., Restore and
                   Last saved
                 - Continued implementation for the Exec class

                   with specified ID.
                 - Continued implementation for the Image class

03-Oct-96 Prefs: - Started to implement EntryList class

                 - Completed implementation of Dock class

05-Oct-96 Prefs: - Completed implementation of EntryList class
                   Only the Drag&Drop of TM objects is not satisfactory yet.
                 - Added "Delete" button to ListPanel class
                 - ListPanel for Access objects is set to disabled now.

          Libs:  - Added localization

06-Oct-96 ToolManager 3.0 Alpha 2

11-Oct-96 Prefs:  - Added missing string terminator to font string
                  - Fixed font height conversion for trailing zeros

12-Oct-96 Prefs:  Completed bubble help
          Locale: Updated german catalogs

13-Oct-96 Global:    Refined debugging stuff a bit. All programs are now
                     compiled with DEBUG=0. Now debug output is only generated
                     if activated or a fatal error occurs.
          Prefs:     Implemented support for new Popposition.mcc class for
                     testing. Thanks to Klaus Melchior for this class.
          WBStartup: New ToolManager starter written

22-Oct-96 Lib:   - Added support for global parameters
                 - Added "Preferences..." to dock menu
                 - Image class now tries <file> and <file>.info when it opens
                   a DataTypes object
                 - ESC/CTRL-C closes a dock window now
          Prefs: - Added support for Popposition.mcc.
                   Removed old "Move Me" window code.
                 - Updated locale
                 - Added "Create Icons" support

23-Oct-96 Lib:   - Image class: Didn't create name for icon file correctly
          Prefs: - The notifications for AppMessage and Window_CloseRequest
                   were created on each window open. This resulted in more and
                   more notifications each time the window was opened. After
                   some rearrangements these notifications are now only created
                   at object creation time.

24-Oct-96 Prefs: - TMA_List wasn't supplied when object was created during
                   configuration file read. This resulted in a crash when the
                   TMM_Edit method was send to the object.
                 - Implemented support for new Popport.mcc class.
                   Thanks to Klaus Melchior for this class.

28-Oct-96 Prefs: - Removed own PopScreen class. Using Popscreen.mui instead
                 - Popport object in Sound class only display ARexx ports
                 - Now a new object has some meaningful flags set

28-Oct-96 ToolManager 3.0 Alpha 3

03-Nov-96 Lib: - Moved common IFF parsing code into Base class method
               - Now waits up to one second in library open for handler startup
               - Started to implement support for library functions
               - Implemented tags parser for Exec, Image and Sound classes.
                 They can be generated with the library interface now.

10-Nov-96 Lib: - Implemented tags parser for Menu, Icon and Dock classes.
                 Now all objects can be generated with the library interface.

16-Nov-96 Prefs: - Implemented support for new Pophotkey.mcc class.
                   Thanks to Klaus Melchior for this class.
                 - Removed MUIA_Popstring_Button from Pop* objects. They are
                   generated by those classes itself and will be user-setable
                   in the future.
                 - Implemented command line parsing/tool types.

24-Nov-96 Prefs:     - Double-click on a cliplist entry starts object editing
                     - Startup code rewritten
          Conv:      - Recompiled without DEBUG flag
          WBStartup: - Starter recompiled without DEBUG flag

24-Nov-96 ToolManager 3.0 Beta 1

26-Nov-96 Lib: - Implemented global image remap enable flag. If this flag is
                 not set then the datatype images are not remapped. Prefs
                 support not implemented yet.
               - Implemented image cache for datatypes objects. Now the docks
                 open fast again if the images are in the cache. Low memory
                 handler not implemented yet.

27-Nov-96 WBStartup: - Removed global variable
          Lib:       - Fixed Enforcer Hit when a datatype image couldn't be
                       opened
                     - Low memory handler implemented. In low memory situations
                       a signal is sent to the handler. It then purges all
                       image caches. Note that the memory allocation which
                       trigged the low memory situation still fails, because
                       the low memory handler itself can't free any memory.
                       But the memory is released ASAP.
          Prefs:     - Added prefs support for global image remap enable flag
                     - Updated locale
                     - The execute flag of the config file is cleared
                     - The icon stored under ENV:Sys/def_prefs.info is used
                       when creating icons for the config file.
                     - The default directory for "Open.../Save As..." is now
                       SYS:Prefs/Presets as specified in the AUISG.
                     - Now always a stack of 8192 bytes is installed before
                       the MUI application is created.
                     - Added CLI Parameter/Tooltype CREATEICONS
                     - The trailing ".font" gets stripped when the font entry
                       is read from the config file.

28-Nov-96 Prefs: - Implemented sort method for ListTree class. It works but
                   some details need to be improved in Listtree.mcc.
          Conv:  - The execute flage of the coverted config file is cleared
                 - Now writes global parameters chunk with remap flag set

29-Nov-96 ToolManager 3.0 Beta 2

29-Nov-96 Prefs: - Double click on dock entry list opens edit window for the
                   selected object

30-Nov-96 Prefs: - DropArea objects behave now like buttons. When you press
                   them then the edit window of the linked object is opened.
                   I'm not sure if this is good GUI design but it is sure a
                   fast way to access linked objects.
                 - Started to implement HelpFile support
          Misc:  - Started to work on new documentation

01-Dec-96 Lib: - DTM_PROCLAYOUT was not called when remap was disabled. Thus
                 the destination bitmap did NOT exist at all! Ooops :-)
                 This only happened with the original C= picture.datatype. It
                 seems that the PictDT V43 always delivers a valid bitmap.

05-Dec-96 Prefs: - Added safety check to MUIM_DragQuery methods and corrected
                   return values from OM_GET methods. This fixes the crashes
                   which happened when you tried f.ex. to drag&drop from one
                   EntryList to another.
                 - Locale: Changed "Hot Key" to "Hotkey"
                 - Changed "ENV:sys/def_prefs" to "ENV:sys/def_pref"

07-Dec-96 Misc: - Installer script written

08-Dec-96 Lib:  - Added missing TMOP_Font support in Dock objects
                - Checked handler state changes. Slight modifications
                - Delay loop (implemented 03-Nov-96) moved from LibOpen() to
                  AllocTMHandle() where it should have been in the first place.
          Misc: - Created developer files
                - Created distribution structure
                - Created readme files
                - Finished english documentation

08-Dec-96 ToolManager 3.0 Beta 3

12-Dec-96 Misc: - Corrected typo in Installer script "Readme.Extra"
                  -> "Readme.Extras"

14-Dec-96 Lib:    - It could happen that the TM Handler started although the
                    dospath.library couldn't be opened.
          Global: - Added initialization flag to debug version of the memory
                    system so that deleting the uninitialized system doesn't
                    create an Enforcer hit anymore.

14-Dec-96 ToolManager 3.0 Beta 4

15-Dec-96 Prefs/WBStartup: - Why did I think that GetMsg() actually waits for
                             the Workbench startup message? RTFM! FIXED.

15-Dec-96 ToolManager 3.0 Beta 5

17-Dec-96 Lib:  - Used wrong parameter to flush image cache on Workbench close
                  event.
          Misc: - Changed intro text in installer script so that it is correct
                  even with topaz/8.
                - Use copyfiles instead of copylib for Prefs/Starter.

17-Dec-96 ToolManager 3.0 Beta 6

08-Feb-97 Prefs: - Now the popup gadget for the command is disabled for the
                   exec types Dock, Hotkey and Network. In these cases the
                   ASL requester was not appropriate.
                 - Added remap precision to global settings window.
                   NOTE: Load and save your preferences with the new prefs
                         program at least once!
          Lib:   - Added support for remap precision. Couldn't see any
                   difference on my machine though...
          Conv:  - Added remap precision initialization
          Misc:  - Updated documentation
                 - Finished german documentation

09-Feb-97 All: - Recompiled without debugging code

09-Feb-97 ToolManager 3.0 Beta 7

23-Feb-97 ToolManager 3.0 Release Version

14-Mar-97 All:  - Changed locale.library version from 39 to 38
          Lib:  - Fixed offset calculation for AppEvent mouse position. If the
                  border of a dock was activated then the wrong gadget was
                  activated when an icon was dropped on the dock
          Prefs - Standard string gadget length changed from 30 to 80
                - Base for methods/tags changed from 0x90000000 to 0x80100000

12-Apr-97 Lib: - Fixed a stupid copy & paste bug. The dispatchers for the TM
                 object BOOPSI classes didn't have the __geta4 qualifier set.
                 This of course means that A4 might not be set correctly, but
                 it seems that it works OK under AmigaOS V39 & V40. It could
