COPYRIGHT

   Copyright (C) 1996 Stefan Becker

   No program, document, data file or  source  code  from  this  software
package, neither in whole nor in part, may be included or used  in  other
software packages unless it is authorized by a  written  permission  from
the author.


NO WARRANTY

   There is no warranty for this software package.  Although  the  author
has tried to prevent errors he can't guarantee that the software  package
described in this document is 100% reliable. You are therefore using this
material at your own risk. The author cannot be made responsible for  any
damage which is caused by using this software package.


DISTRIBUTION

   This software package is freely distributable. It may be transfered to
any media which is used for the distribution of free software like Public
Domain disk collections, CDROMs, FTP servers or bulletin board systems.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package distributors
should use the original archive file DOSPath1_0.lha (file name on Aminet:
DOSPath.lha). The author cannot be  made  responsible  if  this  software
package has become unusable due to modifications of the archive  contents
or of the archive file itself.

   There is no limit on the fee taken by distributors, e.g. for the media
costs of floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact discs, or the process of
duplicating. Such limits have proven to be harmful to the idea of  freely
distributable software, e.g. the software package was removed instead  of
reducing the price of a floppy disk below the limit.

   Although the author does not impose any limit on these fees  he  would
like to express his personal opinions on this matter:

   * This software package should be made available to everyone  free  of
     charge whenever this is possible.

   * If you have purchased this software package under normal  conditions
     from a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk and have paid more than
     5DM or US $5 then you have definitely paid too  much.  Please  don't
     support this improper profit making  any  longer  and  switch  to  a
     cheaper source as soon as possible.


USAGE RESTRICTIONS

   No program, document, data file or  source  code  from  this  software
package, neither in whole nor in part, may be used on any  machine  which
is used

   * for the research, development, construction, testing  or  production
     of weapons or other military applications. This  also  includes  any
     machine which is  used  in  the  education  for  any  of  the  above
     mentioned purposes.

   * by people who accept, support or use violence against other  people,
     e.g. citizens from foreign countries.



I. What is the purpose of this software package?
================================================

Each CLI process created by AmigaDOS has a so called "command path  list"
a list of directories which is used to  find  the  commands  the  process
wants to run. It can be controlled from  scripts  with  the  CLI  command
"path".

Programs can also supply a path list to a CreateNewProc() call  which  is
used to create new CLI processes. Unfortunately the data  structures  for
AmigaDOS path lists don't appear anywhere in the official  documentation.
Also no support routines for handling path lists  are  available  in  the
dos.library.

If you need to handle path lists in your program then the dospath.library
can help you. It offers support routines for:

  - Copying an existing path list
  - Building a path list from a list of directory names
  - Copying the path list of the Workbench process
  - Freeing a path list
  - Remove a directory from a path list
  - Set and get the path list of a process
  - Find a file using a path list

Please read the Autodoc and the example source code on  how  to  use  the
library.
