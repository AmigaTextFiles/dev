Documentation for MakeLink 1.1                                       21.07.1991

   I. Usage

MakeLink is a replacement for the original 2.0 MakeLink command

      MakeLink <name1> <name2> [HARD]

This will create a link from name1 to name2. It will be a soft link unless the
HARD keyword is specified.

NOTE: Directory lister programs show soft links always as directories. This is
      probably caused by the fact that they don't resolve the soft link for
      examining the type of the real object.


  II. Why a new MakeLink?

Improvements over the 2.0 MakeLink:

   - Supports soft links.

Improvements over Matthias Scheler's (Tron) MakeLink:

   - Bug removed (Didn't UnLock() a lock)
   - Version string
   - Source code available

 III. Compilation

This program was developed with the shareware version of DICE. Use dmake to
compile it.

   V. Legal stuff

This program is freely distributable, but copyrighted by me. This means that
you can copy it freely as long as you don't ask for any more money than a
nominal fee for copying. THIS APPLIES TO GERMAN PD DEALERS TOO!!! This program
may be put on PD disks, especially on Fred Fish's AmigaLibDisks. If you want to
distribute this program you MUST keep this document and the source code with
it. Program, document and source code must be distributed in their original
unmodified form. Of course you can use an archiver like LHarc to make it
available on mailboxes and FTP sites. This program cannot be used for
commercial purposes without written permission from the author. The author can
not be made responsible for any damage which is caused by using this program.
