          - New environment variable "UMSUUCP.mb" for message base name.
          - Partial support for RFC 1342 (Non-US-ASCII RFC 822 Headers).
          - Partial support for RFC 1341 (MIME, quoted-printable encoding).

15-Nov-92 - umsuucp V0.2

18-Nov-92 - Added missing "UserName" line to lib/config

23-Nov-92 - Didn't leave nextgroup loop in rnews.c if UMS error occured
          - Improved error logging in rnews.c/rbsmtp.c

16-Dec-92 - Error logging completely rewritten. Now all errors are logged and
            the complete log is send as mail to "postmaster"

16-Dec-92 - umsuucp V0.3

19-Dec-92 - uuxqt now puts an id string at the beginning of the comments.
            ums2uucp needs this to detect messages from other system.

21-Dec-92 - ums2uucp: News export should be working now. No MIME, No
                      hard-linked news articles (crosspostings).

22-Dec-92 - ums2uucp: Mail export added.

30-Dec-92 - ums2uucp: Removed stupid bug in reading reply msg ID.
          - ums2uucp: Added "X-NewsReader:" field (UMSCODE_NewsReader)

31-Dec-92 - umsuucp V0.4

27-Feb-93 - uuxqt: RFC header lines which contained only the keyword and no
                   white space after the ":" (e.g. "Lines:\n") confused the
                   parser.

28-Feb-93 - uuxqt: Added "Originator:" as a synonym for "From:"
          - uuxqt: Messages with no sender name/address will be set to
                   "Unknown" and "unknown@nowhere"
          - ums2uucp: Fixed Refer ID generation
          - ums2uucp: Fixed multiple export of non-local crossposted messages
          - ums2uucp: Added support for local crossposted messages
                      (Does any UMS newsreader generate crosspostings yet?)
                      Only MIME support left to do...
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: New UMS config var uucp.pathname. If your node name
                            is NOT registered in the UUCP maps, you MUST set
                            this variable to your domain name, otherwise to
                            your registered node name. This is used to generate
                            the "Path:" lines.
          - Added support for new UMS message fields: ReplyName, ReplyAddr,
            ReplyGroup (Followup-To).

28-Feb-93 - umsuucp V0.5

15-Mar-93 - ums2uucp: Fixed a bad bug in the exporting of local messages.
                      AmigaDOS and UNIX have different time epochs, but I
                      didn't correct the difference, so all messages had a date
                      stamp that was 8 years behind the current date.

15-Mar-93 - umsuucp V0.5a

04-Apr-93 - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Fixed handling of "\n." in BSMTP messages
          - ums2uucp: Exits if no system name is specified
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Rewrote UUCP envelope handling. Envelopes are NOT
                            stored in the comments anymore. They are ignored on
                            import and are created on export.
          - ums2uucp: New UMS config var "uucp.dumbhost". If your mail host
                      uses outdated UUCP software and needs the RFC976 envelope
                      format, set this variable to "Y".
          - uuxqt: rmail didn't clear the TOPATH field when it received a mail
                   for a local user (rmail user). This should fix the need for
                   many AKA lines in the UMS config.

04-Apr-93 - umsuucp V0.6

07-Apr-93 - ums2uucp: Corrected "Organisation" to "Organization"

18-Apr-93 - created lib/.seq. It is NOT created automatically :-(
          - updated documentation for UMS Server V10.

13-Jun-93 - ums2uucp: Fixed infinite loop while scanning hardlinks. This
                      requires at least an umsserver>=10.12!
          - Ported (n)compress, freeze & gzip
          - uuxqt: Now you can give the system name on the command line.
                   If a system name ist specified, uuxqt tries to scan the
                   directory with the same name in the UUSPOOL: directory.
          - uuxqt: Refined error levels. Now all UMS errors>=300 are fatal
                   and cause uuxqt to abort processing.
          - uuxqt: New UMS config var "uucp.keepdupes". If you want to keep
                   jobs which contain dupes, then set this variable to "Y".
          - uuxqt: If a directory "bad-jobs" exists in the spool directory
                   for the system, then all jobs with errors are moved to this
                   directory. Otherwise the old X.* -> E.* renaming is used.
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Support for zipped files added.
          - ums2uucp: Added "X-Mailer:" field for mails (UMSCODE_NewsReader)
          - ums2uucp: Sub directories in the UUSPOOL: directory (see above)
          - ums2uucp: If the attribute "fileattach" is set, it will use the
                      subject line as a file name and append the contents of
                      this file uuencoded to the message.
          - started to rewrite documentation

20-Jun-93 - ums2uucp: Now tries to build a complete "Reference:" line.
          - uuxqt: Now sets the attribute "MIME" if it could decode a MIME
                   messages successfully.
          - ums2uucp: Now creates MIME headers.

27-Jun-93 - uuxqt: Improved SplitAddress(). Now detects quoted characters and
                   strings. Stops parsing when a "," is encountered.
          - uuxqt: More robust parsing of the "Newsgroups:" line.
          - uuxqt: Mails to multiple recipients are correctly handled now.
          - uuxqt: Corrupt Msg-Ids are stored in the comments
          - uuxqt: Added handling of "Content-Length:"
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Changed handling of "In-Reply-To:"
          - ums2uucp: Real names are now always enclosed in ""
          - ums2uucp: New option "-b". This specifies the bit number of an
                      additional select bit in the user flags.
          - Finished new documentation

27-Jun-93 - umsuucp V0.7

11-Sep-93 - uuxqt: Dupe-Mails are now checked if the recipients are different.
                   If they are different, the new message is stored as
                   soft-link to the original message.
          - uuxqt: Only a correct Refer-ID from "References:" will be used.
          - uuxqt: Added support for control messages with cancel command.
                   uuxqt tries to delete the specified message. Control
                   messages are only visible to exporters.
          - uuxqt: Added "X-Mailer:"/"X-NewsReader:" headers.
          - ums2uucp: Added missing "Distribution:" header for local news
                      messages.

12-Sep-93 - ums2uucp: "Reply-To:" with real name enclosed in ""'s now.
          - ums2uucp: Mails to multiple users, that is mails which are
                      soft-linked together, are now supported. ums2uucp will
                      create a "To:" line with multiple recipients. If the
                      mail transfer is not batched, ums2uucp will "optimize"
                      the transfer by issuing a rmail command with multiple
                      recipients.

13-Sep-93 - ums2uucp: Reworked the handling of UMSExportedMsg().
          - ums2uucp: "To:" with real name enclosed in ""'s now.

18-Sep-93 - uuxqt: Reworked dupe check for mails.

19-Sep-93 - ums2uucp: Doesn't add the user name to the "Path:" line on local
                      messages anymore. According to RFC 1036 this is an
                      optional feature to maintain upward compatibility to
                      older systems, which use the "Path:" line incorrectly as
                      reply address.
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Support for mail with multiple recipients in BSMTP
                            added.
          - ums2uucp: Messages with non-empty from address can now be exported.
                      NOTE: No address or date conversion takes place (yet)!!!

27-Sep-93 - ums2uucp: Some news systems can't cope with a "Path:" line without
                      a user name. Now a dummy user name "news" is added.
          - ums2uucp: ReplyAddr/Name now goes through address conversion too.

03-Oct-93 - uuxqt: Added UUCP commands crsmtp,frsmtp, grsmtp and zrsmtp.
                   Updated documentation.
          - gzip: Ported new version 1.2.4

11-Oct-93 - ums2uucp: Added address conversion for Maus/Z-Netz/Fidonet
          - ums2uucp: ToAddr/ToName now goes through address conversion too.

22-Oct-93 - ums2uucp: "Distribution:", "Followup-To:", "X-Mailer:",
                      "X-NewsReader:" were created twice.
          - ums2uucp: Recipient addresses in "C rmail"/"RCPT TO:" lines go
                      through address conversion too.
          - ums2uucp: Corrected the Z-Netz and Fidonet address conversion.
          - ums2uucp: New news/mail export command syntax:
                       "<xcmd> , <batch> , <compcmd> , <dhdr> ,<max size>"
                      e.g. uucp.newsexport = rnews,Y,compress,cunbatch,200000
                           uucp.mailexport = rmail,N
                           uucp.mailexport = rgbsmtp,Y,gzip,,200000

23-Oct-93 - ums2uucp: Now creates R and Z commands in the UUCP command file
          - ums2uucp: Domain name for Fidonet is now configurable. New UMS
                      config var "uucp.fidodomain" (Default: fidonet.org).
          - ums2uucp: Now reads time zone from Locale.

24-Oct-93 - uuxqt: Command file parsing and data file handling rewritten. The
                   type of the data file is now automagically recognized.
          - uuxqt: Added address conversion for Maus/Z-Netz/Fidonet.

15-Nov-93 - uuxqt: SplitAddress() accepts '_' and '.' as replacement for ' '
                   in real names now.
          - uuxqt: Parsing of Fidonet addresses more robust now.
          - uuxqt: Now reads real name of recipient for incoming mails.
          - ums2uucp: Fixed retrieving of "uucp.username".

17-Nov-93 - ums2uucp: Now checks the old flag of a soft-linked message. Only
                      unread messages are exported again.

20-Nov-93 - ums2uucp: UMS config var "uucp.fidodomain" removed.
          - ums2uucp: New UMS config vars "uucp.export.(fido|maus|zer)". They
                      specify the domain names for the nets.

                      Defaults:
                       Fidonet: uucp.export.fido "fidonet.org"
                       Maus   : uucp.export.maus "maus.de"
                       Z-Netz : uucp.export.zer  "zer.sub.org"

          - ums2uucp: UMS config var "8bitclean" removed (was never used).
          - ums2uucp: New UMS config var "uucp.encoding". Legal values for
                      this var are "8bit" and "binary". Use "binary" if you
                      can't assure that the line length of your messages
                      never exceeds 1000 characters. Default: "8bit".
          - ums2uucp: New UMS config var "uucp.mailroute" (Default: <none>).
                      You can now specify explicit mail routes. Each line in
                      this variable does contain an address pattern and a list
                      of hosts:

                       <address pattern> [<host1>[,<host2>....]]

                      When the recipient address matches the address pattern
                      and the host list is not empty, then ums2uucp will create
                      an explicit mail route. The route information will be
                      added AFTER the address conversion for Fidonet, Maus and
                      Z-Netz has been applied.

                      If the variable does contain several lines, then the
                      patterns will be tried from the first line down to the
                      last line until one pattern matches. If no pattern
                      matches, then no route information will be generated.

                      Example:
                       uucp.mailroute = "#?.maus.de  host1
                       #?.zer.sub.org                host2,host3
                       #?.fidonet.org
                       #?.de                         host4"

                      Test cases:
                       user@box.maus.de
                       user@box.zer.sub.org
                       user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org
                       user@zauber.nase.de
                       user@dummy.blubb.edu

                      These will be transformed to the following mail routes:
                       - RMail: C rmail host1!box.maus.de!user
                                C rmail host2!host3!box.zer.sub.org!user
                                C rmail user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org
                                C rmail host4!zauber.nase.de!user
                                C rmail user@dummy.blubb.edu
                       - BSMTP: RCPT TO: <@host1:user@box.maus.de>
                                RCPT TO: <@host2,@host3:user@box.zer.sub.org>
                                RCPT TO: <user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org>
                                RCPT TO: <@host4:user@zauber.nase.de>
                                RCPT TO: <user@dummy.blubb.edu>

21-Nov-93 - uuxqt: New UMS config vars "uucp.import.(fido|maus|zer)". They
                   specify which domain names uuxqt should recognize for the
                   nets. Each variable does contain a comma seperated list of
                   domains. If the list is empty, then uuxqt does not perform
                   an address conversion for the net.

                   Example:
                    uucp.import.maus = ".maus.de,.maus.sub.org"

                   With this entry, uuxqt will recognize "A_B@HB.maus.de" and
                   "A_B@HB.maus.sub.org" as Maus addresses and convert them
                   to the UMS address format for the Maus net (Name: "A B",
                   Address: "HB.maus").

                   Defaults:
                    Fidonet: uucp.import.fido ".fidonet.org"
                    Maus   : uucp.import.maus ".maus.de"
                    Z-Netz : uucp.import.zer  ".zer.sub.org"

          - ums2uucp: The format for the UMS config vars "uucp.export.*" has
                      changed. They now have a '.' at the beginning too, just
                      like the corresponding UMS config vars "uucp.import.*".

                      Defaults:
                       Fidonet: uucp.export.fido ".fidonet.org"
                       Maus   : uucp.export.maus ".maus.de"
                       Z-Netz : uucp.export.zer  ".zer.sub.org"

20-Nov-93 - ums2uucp: Did not create "DATA" line in front of the mail data for
                      batched mail transfers.

26-Nov-93 - uuxqt: Removed change from 15-Nov-93. Now the recipient address
                   is used again for incoming mail.
          - Revised documentation to include all new features.

27-Nov-93 - Reformatted documentation
          - Added a chapter about "Leaf node/Full node/Gateway" setup.

01-Dec-93 - umsuucp V0.8

29-Jan-94 - ums2uucp: New UMS config var "uucp.recipients". This variable
                      specifies the maximum number of recipients which are
                      exported in one mail for multi-recipient mails. Set this
                      variable to the maximum number of recipients which your
                      host node can handle in one mail.

                      NOTE: If a mail has more recipients than this limit,
                            then it has to be exported several times!

                      Example:
                       uucp.recipients = 2
                        - mail with 2 recipients: exported once
                        - mail with 5 recipients: exported 3 (2/2/1) times

                      Default: 4294967295 (virtually unlimited)

01-Feb-94 - ums2uucp: Meaning of UMS config var "uucp.encoding" changed. It
                      is now a number which specifies the transfer encoding
                      type:

                        0 - no encoding (default)
                        1 - quoted-printable
                        2 - base64 (not yet implemented)

                      Use 0 if the link to the host is 8-Bit clean, otherwise
                      1 (or 2 in the future).

03-Feb-94 - ums2uucp: Fixed quoted-printable encoding for BSMTP

05-Feb-94 - ums2uucp: The local command files are created with temporary file
                      names before starting a UUCP job. After a job has been
                      created sucessfully, the command file will be renamed
                      to the final "C." form.

27-Feb-94 - ums2uucp: A '.' wasn't qouted for BSMTP if it was the first
                      character of the message text.
          - uuxqt: Fixed recognition of RFC keywords, e.g. "DateXYZ" is not
                   recognized as "Date" anymore.
          - uuxqt: New UMS config var "uucp.filtercr". If this variable is set
                   to "Y", then all CR (=13) characters are removed before
                   processing the messages. Default: N

31-Mar-94 - uuxqt: If the message text was zero bytes long (that is the message
                   consisted only of the header and one empty line) the pointer
                   to the message text in the UMS tags was pointing one byte
                   after the string terminator. So UMS tried to read and read
                   and read... :-(

05-Apr-94 - uuxqt: If a quoted printable text did end with a '=', the string
                   terminator was skipped (result see above :-( ).
          - Fixed some source code lines which caused warning messages from
            DICE 3.0

17-May-94 - ums2uucp: Added support for LogicalToName/Addr
          - ums2uucp: If the UMS config var "uucp.username" is missing for an
                      user, ums2uucp will still issue an error message, but it
                      will build an address with the name "UNKNOWN"
          - uuxqt: Fixed CR filter for news batches

05-Jun-94 - uuxqt: "Filesystem full" is now a fatal error
          - uuxqt: If a news message couldn't be written to any newsgroup (that
                   is no write access to any group) then a warning message is
                   written to the log. The command and data file will not be
                   deleted.
          - uuxqt: No longer sets the return code to 20 when no files can be
                   found
          - uuxqt: All control messages are written to the group "rfc.control".
                   This prevents the creation of dummy "control" groups and
                   allows the controlled export of control messages to other
                   nodes.
          - uuxqt: Support for new V11 field MsgCDate added
          - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Fixed handling of messages without "Date:" field

25-Jun-94 - First working version of umsrfc.library available. Started to
            convert uuxqt/ums2uucp for umsrfc.library.

26-Jun-94 - Conversion finished. After fixing some smaller bugs and glitches
            the new versions worked. Due to the conversion, some variable names
            have been changed:

             uucp.domainname  ->  rfc.domainname
             uucp.encoding    ->  rfc.encoding
             uucp.pathname    ->  rfc.pathname
             uucp.username    ->  rfc.username

            NOTE: Before installing the new versions you MUST run first the old
                  ums2uucp for all systems! The new ums2uucp won't recognize
                  messages imported by the old uuxqt!
            NOTE: Don't forget to copy libs/umsrfc.library to LIBS:!

27-Jun-94 - Forgot to mention the following changed variables:

             uucp.import.*  ->  rfc.import.*
             uucp.export.*  ->  rfc.export.*

          - ums2uucp: Fixed creation of "RCPT TO:" lines.

08-Jul-94 - ums2uucp: Optimized marking of exported news messages. If you use
                      UMSExportedMsg()/UMSSelect() on one message, this action
                      will be performed on ALL hard-linked messages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
??-???-?? - Creating umsrfc.library from UMS UUCP sources

25-Jun-94 - First full working version. Yeah!

26-Jun-94 - write.c: If CDate is valid use it instead of receiving date.

26-Jun-94 - umsrfc.library 0.1

28-Jun-94 - write.c: Detection of UMS-RFC header in comment field didn't work!
                     If the comment field was set, then WriteMessage() thought
                     this was an RFC header saved by ReadMessage(). This was of
                     course completely wrong when the message was created by
                     another importer, e.g. UMSFido.
          - UMS-RFC Header changed from "UMS-RFC" to "UMS-RFC\n"

28-Jun-94 - umsrfc.library 0.2

30-Jun-94 - split.c: Added safety checks on FIDO & Maus address conversion.
                     There are some really stupid gateways out there :-(

30-Jun-94 - umsrfc.library 0.3

04-Jul-94 - putnews.c: Forgot to set the group name.

04-Jul-94 - umsrfc.library 0.4

15-Sep-94 - alloc.c: Removed wrong deallocation. This fixes the crashes when
                     "rfc.domainname" or "rfc.pathname" weren't defined.

          - write.c: The path is now created with "not-for-mail" instead of
                     "postmaster"

          - freemsg.c: CREATED. New function UMSRFCFreeMessage().

15-Sep-94 - umsrfc.library 0.5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24-Sep-94 - Joined all UMS RFC projects (library, inet, uucp) into one source
            tree.
          - Restructured all directories into the new directory structure for
            the UMS project.
          - umsrfc.doc: CREATED (AutoDoc for umsrfc.library)

25-Sep-94 - umsrfc.tex: CREATED (new UMS RFC documentation in Texinfo)
          - get.c/freemsg.c: Support for attributes field parsing added.
                             Current attributes template:

                              ALIAS/K,RECEIPT-REQUEST/K,URGENT/S

          - get.c: Support for ALIAS attribute added. A check is made, that
                   the specified alias is an alias for the user. If this fails
                   the alias is ignored and "rfc.username" is used.
          - read.c/write.c: Support for RECEIPT-REQUEST and URGENT attributes
                            added.

                            NOTE: Receipt messages will not (yet) be created.

25-Sep-94 - umsrfc.library 0.6

26-Sep-94 - smtpclient/sendmsg.c: Fixed stupid memory deallocation bug.

22-Oct-94 - uuxqt: Fixed Log generation.
          - all exporters: Added support for global "parked" UMS status bit.
                           It is not supported yet by other programs, so this
                           feature is untested.
          - all inet clients: Added CTRL-C handler.
          - pop3client/*: CREATED (new POP3 client program for UMS)

07-Nov-94 - uuxqt: Didn't check for NULL UMSRFCData pointers during logout.
          - misc.c: Now uses UMSRFCData pointer instead of FindTask(NULL) for
                    temporary names. This fixes the "can't open log file" error
                    when one task has several active logins, like uuxqt.
          - all inet sources: Adapted to new AmiTCP 4.0 library call names

15-Nov-94 - time.c: Create & accept RFC 1123 date format (4 digits for year)
          - alloc.c/free.c/getmsg.c/freemsg.c/write.c:
               Support for UMSCODE_RfcAttr field. It is not supported yet by
               other programs, so this feature is untested. The field is parsed
               with ReadArgs() using the pattern "MISC/M". Each argument MUST
               contain a valid RFC header field which is added to the normal
               RFC header created by umsrfc.library.

               WARNING: THESE HEADERS ARE NOT CHECKED!!! This feature enhances
                        the flexibility of the header generation but increases
                        the responsibility for the user. You have been warned!

               Example:

                "Approved: dummy@test.earth.sol" "X-Field: Supid Content"

16-Nov-94 - smptserver/*: CREATED (new SMTP server program for UMS)
          - convert.c: UMSRFCConvertAddress renamed to UMSRFCConvertUMSAddress
          - split.c: GetAddress() now available through library interface:
                     UMSRFCConvertRFCAddress()

19-Nov-94 - split.c: Corrected bug in address conversion: Only "!" (bang paths)
                     were converted to domain format. Now also addresses which
                     contain ":" or "%" are converted.

20-Nov-94 - smtpserver: First working version.

26-Nov-94 - smtpserver: UMSTAG_WCheckHeader is working now (UMS server 11.12).
                        Now the server can check if a recipient address is
                        valid.
          - putmail.c: UMS server dupe-checking & auto-softlink is working now
                       (UMS server 11.12). Removed own dupe checking code.

27-Nov-94 - nntpserver: Now uses UMSTAG_CfgLocal for pattern variables
          - readline.c: Now really reads one line from socket

30-Nov-94 - umsrfc.library 0.7

29-Mar-95 - read.c:    Use "Originator:" line only if there is no "From:" line.
                       Only the first "Originator:" line is used.
            write.c:   Fixed text encoding. Text was always encoded quoted-printable.
            alloc.c/write.c:
                       Now you can specify separate encoding types for Mail and News:

                           rfc.mailencoding - Encoding type for Mail
                           rfc.newsencoding - Encoding type for News

                       The old variable "rfc.encoding" is obsolete.
            write.c:   RECEIPT-REQUEST parameter is now put through address conversion
            alloc.c/free.c:
                       Support for "rfc.replydaemon". This UMS variable specifies the
                       user name for the RECEIPT-REQUEST reply daemon.
            putmail.c: If RECEIPT-REQUEST is set, a reply daemon specified and the
                       recipient is a local user, then the message is written as a
                       softlink to the reply daemon user.

                       NOTE: Only one receipt message can be created even if the mail
                             is sent to several local users.

08-Apr-95 - connect.c: GetConnectData() now also accepts TCP/IP port numbers.
            umssmtp:   New option "-S" for specifying a different TCP/IP service
                       name or port instead of "smtp" (25).
            umssmtp:   Only creates a connection to the remote host if new messages
                       are available.
            umssmtp:   Prints error message from SMTP server.
            umssmtp:   Sends message only if at least one recipient is valid.
            umsnntp:   New option "-S" for specifying a different TCP/IP service
                       name or port instead of "nntp" (119).
            umsnntp:   Only creates a connection to the remote host if new messages
                       are available.
            umsnntp:   Prints error message from NNTP server.
            umspop3:   New option "-S" for specifying a different TCP/IP service
                       name or port instead of "pop3" (110).

10-Apr-95 - umssmtpd: Rewritten as inetd daemon. Add the following line to
                      AmiTCP:db/inetd.conf:

    smtp stream tcp nowait root <UMS Path>umssmtpd umssmtpd <user> <password> <server>

22-Apr-95 - umsnntpd: Rewritten as inetd daemon. Add the following line to
                      AmiTCP:db/inetd.conf:

    nntp stream tcp nowait root <UMS Path>umsnntpd umsnntpd <user> <password> <server>

23-Apr-95 - umsnntpd: Fixed access check.

24-Apr-95 - umsnntpd: Fixed error in response "430 no such article found".

25-Apr-95 - umsnntpget: Most of the code rewritten.
          - umsnntpget: New option "-S" for specifying a different TCP/IP service
                        name or port instead of "nntp" (119).
          - umsnntpget: New option "-P": specifies the number of parallel processes for
                        article requests. This can be used to make NNTP transfers over
                        SLIP/PPP lines more effective.
          - umsnntpget: New option "-g": Use GROUP and STAT/NEXT commands to scan
                        newsgroups instead of NEWNEWS. This should lower the load on
                        the remote NNTP server.

                        Note: The UMS variable "nntpget.groups" must contain one
                              group name per line for this mode, e.g.

                          ( nntpget.groups "comp.sys.amiga.announce\n"
                                           "comp.sys.amiga.misc\n"
                                           "comp.sys.amiga.programmers\n" )

          - umsnntpget: New option "-c" (replaces "-i"): Use message ids or group names
                        (with option "-g") specified on the command line.

30-Apr-95 - umsnntpd: Now sends response "502 can't talk to you" if the remote client
                      is not allowed to access this server.
          - clients:  Print error message for unkown options.
          - umssmtp/umsnntp: Print "sent..." after message text has been sent to
                             remote server.
          - library:  Removed address conversion for Zerberus addresses, because they
                      now use RFC compatible addresses.
          - library:  Added a check if ToName is valid before printing it into the
                      "To:" line.
          - ums2uucp: Now also uses the options h/p/s/u as the other clients.
                      Note that the old option "-s" has been changed to "-h".
          - uuxqt:    New option "-p" to set the UMS password.
                      Note that this password is used for ALL logins.

02-May-95 - umsrfc.library 0.8

09-May-95 - library:    Doesn't append message terminator ("\n.\n") anymore. The
                        clients are now required to append it!
          - library:    Don't create MIME headers for 7bit ASCII messages.
          - umsnntpget: Fixed the interpretation of the "-g" option.
          - TCP/IP programs: All commands and responses are now send with CRLF.
          - uuxqt:      New config var "uucp.logdupes" to suppress logging of dupe
                        messages. (Default: Yes)

10-May-95 - library: Last change broke generation of "8bit" MIME headers. FIXED
          - library: Removed code for creating softlink message for return receipts.
          - library: Changed check in "To:" line from ToName to Group. Now softlinked
                     mail and news should work.

12-May-95 - umsnntp/umssmtp: Improved error messages/handling.

14-May-95 - umsnntp: Fixed sending of crossposted messages.

14-May-95 - umsrfc.library 0.9

28-May-95 - New documentation finished
          - umsnntpget: New option "-q" suppresses printing of message ids.
          - umsnntpget: New upper limit of 20 for option "-P".
          - umssmtpd:   "RSET" command didn't get a response. FIXED
          - library:    Empty parameter ("") is now accepted for RECEIPT-REQUEST.

04-Jun-95 - umsrfc.library 0.10

04-Jul-95 - umspop3: Fixed Mungwall hit.

12-Oct-95 - library: MIME charset parameter may be enclosed in "".
          - library: New UMS variable "rfc.dstime". Set to "Y" for Daylight
                     Saving Time.
          - library: Generates "X-Gateway" (GateBau). UNTESTED!
          - library: Support for UMS binary field. The data will be uuencoded
                     and appended to the normal message text.
          - umspop3: Return WARN if there are no messages in the mail box.
          - umspop3: New option "-k" to keep messages in the mail box.

                     Note: If you don't delete the messages by any other means
                           you will get dupes when you next time use umspop3.
                           The POP3 protocol doesn't use message IDs, so
                           umspop3 has to transfer the message first before
                           it can detect a dupe.
          - umspop3: Didn't show dupes. FIXED

14-Oct-95 - umspop3d: CREATED. First working version of POP3 server. Use
                      the following line in inetd.conf:

    pop3 stream tcp nowait root <UMS Path>umspop3d umspop3d <user> <password> <server>

16-Oct-95 - ums2uucp: Implemented UUCP "Grades".

                Note: The format of the UMS variables uucp.mailexport and
                      uucp.export has changed:

                   <xcmd> , <grade>, <batch> , <compcmd> , <dhdr> ,<max size>"

                      The grade is one letter of '0'..'9', 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z'.
                      It specifies the transfer priority for the UUCP job. '0'
                      has the highest priority and 'z' the lowest. The default
                      is 'A'.

                Examples:

                   uucp.newsexport = rnews,A,Y,compress,cunbatch,200000
                   uucp.mailexport = rmail,C,N
                   uucp.mailexport = rgbsmtp,0,Y,gzip,,200000

          - umsnntpd:   Fixed error response to GROUP command.
          - umsnntpget: Implemented CTRL-C handling. It is not very efficient
                        with the "-g" command option.
          - umsnntp/umspop3/umssmtp:
                        New option "-w" to specify the wait period in seconds
                        between two import/export runs.
          - library:    Fixed a bug in the internal printf() function which
                        caused 0-Bytes in the uuencoding.

21-Oct-95 - library: Fixed a bug in the date string of "X-Gateway" field for
                     news messages.

29-Oct-95 - library: Removed "X-Gateway" again.
          - umssmtpd: New UMS variable "smtpd.log". Set to "Y" to enable SMTP
                      command logging.
          - umsnntpd: New UMS variable "nntpd.log". Set to "Y" to enable NNTP
                      command logging.

25-Nov-95 - umsnntpd:    Fixed IHAVE command. It didn't work but it seems
                         nobody noticed :-)
          - umsnntpget:  No more empty "Group:" printouts with trailing "\n"
                         in nntpget.groups
          - library:     New UMS variable "rfc.receivedname". If this variable
                         is set then its contents will be used for creating
                         the "by" parameter of the "Received:" lines. If it is
                         not set then the contents of rfc.domainname will be
                         used.
          - setnntpdate: New tool to set "nntpget.lastrequest"

09-Dec-95 - umsrfc.library 0.11

10-Feb-95 - library:  Interface changed. You MUST use the newest versions of
                      the programs with this library!
          - library:  Removed "rfc.receivedname".
          - library:  New UMS config var "rfc.noownfqdn". Set this variable to
                      "Y" if your system does not have its own domain name
                      (FQDN), e.g. when you receive your mail via POP3.

                      When this flag is set UMS RFC will no longer create
                      "Received:" lines or adding the systems' name to "Path:".
                      Thus the system will become a fully private leaf node
                      which is used only for reading and writing, but not for
                      routing messages.

                      This means of course that you can't use UUCP or the
                      NNTP/POP3/SMTP servers for this particular exporter. Also
                      the configuration must insure that no messages which were
                      imported by using this exporter entry may be exported to
                      other systems.

          - umspop3d: Fixed a wrong parameter to UMSSelect() which prevented
                      the setting of the old flag on deleted messages in the
                      UPDATE state.
          - umsnntpd: Added message ID to UMS error message.
          - umssmtpd: Added message ID to UMS error message.
          - umssmtpd: Now also accepts empty parameter in "MAIL FROM:" which
                      is a special case in RFC 821 for error messages.

11-Feb-96 - umssmtpd: Added remote system name to UMS error message.
          - umssmtp:  If "rfc.noownfqdn" is set to "Y" then the hostname
                      "privatehost" is sent in the HELO command to the remote
                      SMTP server.

24-Feb-96 - umssmtpd: Implemented ESMTP support (RFC 1651). Currently the
                      extensions HELP and SIZE (RFC 1653) are supported.

                      The SMTP server now reads the UMS variable "MaxMsgSize"
                      and rejects too big messages when the size is indicated
                      in the MAIL FROM: command. Due to the difference between
                      the message size in the UMS MB and RFC messages this
                      check may fail in boundary conditions and the server will
                      accept messages which are too big for the UMS MB and send
                      an error message only AFTER the message was transfered.

                      This extension of course requires a SMTP client which
                      supports the ESMTP SIZE extension.

25-Feb-96 - inetcommon:   Cleaned up ReadLine function. Now it always returns
                          a valid C string in the buffer.
          - inet sources: Checked usage of ReadLine function.
          - umssmtp:      Implemented ESMTP support (RFC 1651). If the server
                          supports the ESMTP SIZE extension (RFC 1653) then
                          umssmtp will indicate the estimated message size to
                          the server in the MAIL FROM: command.

29-Feb-96 - umsnntpd:    Message buffer was not deallocated on exit. FIXED
          - umsrfcprint: New tool tool to print UMS messages in RFC format. Use
                         the switch "DOTS" to generate transparent messages for
                         NNTP/SMTP/POP3.

06-Mar-96 - library: Fixed enforcer hits during news message parsing if UMS
                     config Var "rfc.noownfqdn" was set to "Y".

08-Mar-96 - library: "rfc.pathname" is now optional. If you don't specify it
                     then UMS RFC will use the contents of "rfc.domainname".

14-Mar-96 - umssmtpd: If UMS rejects a message which is too big then the server
                      replies with error code 552 after the DATA command.
            umsnntpd: If UMS rejects a message which is too big then the server
                      replies with error code 437 after the IHAVE command.
                      NOTE: This response is not allowed for the POST command.

23-Mar-96 - umspop3: Dupe flag is properly cleared now.
          - Installer script and tools included.
          - Documentation updated

24-Mar-96 - umsrfc.library 0.12

05-May-96 - umssmtp/umssmtpd: Checked against newest RFCs:

             RFC 1869 - SMTP Service Extensions (Replaces RFC 1651)
             RFC 1870 - SMTP Service Extension for Message Size Declaration
                        (Replaces RFC 1653)

          - umssmtpd: Implemented SMTP Extension PIPELINING (RFC 1854). This
                      should improve SMTP throughput on connections with high
                      turnaround times.
          - umssmtpd: If only one '.' was send after the DATA command it didn't
                      recognize this as end of message. FIXED.

12-May-96 - umssmtp: Implemented SMTP Extension PIPELINING (RFC 1854). This
                     should improve SMTP throughput on connections with high
                     turnaround times.
          - umssmtp: Now sends "RSET" if mail sending failed.

24-May-97 - library: Now all lines are terminated with CR-LF when they are
                     converted to the RFC-822 format.

25-May-97 - all:        Started to use new version scheme:

                         - Release version:  (= Library version)
                                             Incremented each time the library
                                             interface changes
                         - Release revision: Incremented for each official
                                             release
                         - Library revision: Incremented for each release
                                             (alpha/beta/official)

          - inetcommon: Created common receive message routine. This new
                        routine doesn't strip single CRs anymore. Only CR-LF
                        is translated to LF
          - umsnntpget/umsnntpd/umspop3/umssmtpd:
                        Updated to use the new common receive routine
          - uuxqt:      CR filtering rewritten. Now only CR-LF is translated
                        to LF. UMS config var "uucp.filtercr" is obsolete
          - uuxqt:      Removed last call to old UMS UUCP debugging routine.
                        UMS config vars "uucp.debugfile" and "uucp.debuglevel"
                        are obsolete

26-May-97 - library: Quoted-Printable coding/decoding rewritten. Added sanity
                     check for illegal "=XY" combinations where X, Y are no
                     hexadecimal digits.

27-May-97 - umsnntpd:    An article with empty body caused an empty response to
                         the HEAD command and a crash in the BODY command.
                         FIXED
          - umsnntpd:    The date token in the NEWNEWS command was processed
                         incorrectly. Any month day larger than 30 was rejected
                         thus month day 31 didn't work at all. FIXED
          - umsrfcprint: Return code was always 20. FIXED
          - library:     When a corrupted RFC-822 header ended with the
                         following sequence

                            <line feed><one or more SPACE or TAB>

                         then the parser crashed. FIXED, it now aborts parsing
                         at the end of the buffer and generates an error
                         message.
          - library:     The RFC-822 time is now converted to local time, e.g.

                            10:06:20 -0400 -> 17:06:20

                         for a system with a GMT offset of +3.
          - umsrfcwrite: New tool tool to read RFC messages and write them to
                         the UMS MB. Use the switch "DOTS" to parse transparent
                         messages (like in NNTP/SMTP/POP3). The tool reads the
                         message either from the STDIN or from a file.

                         If you specify any recipient addresses on the command
                         line then the message is mailed to every recipient.
                         Otherwise the article is posted to every group which
                         is specified in the Newsgroups: header.

06-Jun-97 - ums2uucp: Added one {}-block in one function. The result of this
                      missing block must have been some misleading error
                      messages in the UUCP log file :-)

07-Jun-97 - ums2uucp: Replaced UMS config var "uucp.dumbhost" with the new UMS
                      config var "uucp.envelope". It can be set to the
                      following three values:

                         0: No UUCP envelope
                         1: Dumb (RFC 976) UUCP envelope
                         2: Smart UUCP envelope          (default)

                      You must NOT set this variable to 0 if rmail is used as
                      the mail transport.

08-Jun-97 - umsnntp:  Now sends "MODE READER" if option "-i" is not specified.
          - library:  A caller can now specify with a flag if 8bit encoding is
                      allowed. This flag is set by default.

                      Note: If you have specified "No encoding" (0) in the
                            UMS configuration and this flag is NOT set, then
                            messages which usually would be 8bit encoded will
                            be automatically encoded as quoted-printable!

                      When a message is converted to RFC-822 format then a flag
                      informs the caller if the message is 8bit encoded.
          - umssmtp:  Implemented ESMTP 8BITMIME extension (RFC 1652). If the
                      server supports this extension then umssmtp will indicate
                      to the server in the MAIL FROM: command if the message
                      body is 8bit encoded or not. If the server does not
                      support the extension then umssmtp will reset the
                      "8bit encoding allowed" flag (see also above).
          - umssmtpd: Implemented ESMTP 8BITMIME extension (RFC 1652). The
                      server now offers the option 8BITMIME in the greeting and
                      accepts the BODY parameter in the MAIL FROM: command. The
                      value of this parameter is ignored.
          - Documentation updated

10-Jun-97 - uuxqt/ums2uucp: Correction for a small detail in RFC 1036: The
                            article length after the "#! rnews" header counts
                            EOLs as one byte regardless of their encoding. Thus
                            CR-LF counts as ONE byte! FIXED.
          - umsnntpget:     Didn't send LF after ARTICLE command. FIXED
          - umsnntpget:     If the option "-g" is used then the first command
                            send to the server is "MODE READER".
          - Corrected the examples for "uucp.mailexport and "uucp.newsexport"
            in the documentation.

12-Jun-97 - library: "=" can appear in the uuencoded binaries. If the encoding
                     type is "quoted-printable" then it must be translated to
                     "=3D". FIXED.

11-Jun-98 - umsnntpget: Now sends "MODE READER" always directly after opening
                        any connection to the server
          - ums2uucp:   CR-LF are filtered out in rmail/rnews data files. This
                        seems to be the standard UUCP behaviour.

12-Jun-98 - umsnntpd: Implemented support for XOVER and LIST OVERWIEW.FMT

20-Jun-98 - umsnntpd: Article counting for LIST and GROUP corrected

21-Jun-98 - uuxqt: Support for TaylorUUCP-style spool directory layout:

                    UUSPOOL:<system>/X./X.*  for execution files
                    UUSPOOL:<system>/D./D.*  for data files

12-Jul-98 - ums2uucp:           Support for TaylorUUCP-style spool directory
                                and command files added. You have to se the new
                                option "-t" to enable the TaylorUUCP mode.
          - umsnntp/umsnntpget: Added support for NNTP AUTHINFO USER/PASS
                                authentication. The following command line
                                options have been added:

                                 -n <name>    Authentication user name
                                 -i <passwd>  Authentication password

                                These are the same as for umspop3.

                                NOTE: The old umsnntp command line option "-i"
                                      has been renamed to "-I".

13-Jul-98 - uuxqt: The CRLF -> LF translation in the rnews part is now not done
                   on the whole buffer anymore but instead on each message.
                   This works together with real life UUCP implementations
                   which just take the file length as article length. Thus CRLF
                   is counted as 2 bytes.

                   As stated on 10-Jun-97, RFC1036 says that the line end is
                   always counted as one byte even it is stored as CRLF. If
                   this happens then of course the above change is incorrect.
                   *SIGH* I really hate this mess. Let's hope there are no UUCP
                   implementators out there who *DO* read the RFC1036...

20-Feb-99 - Documentation updated

20-Feb-99 - UMS RFC Release 1.0
