@subsection Standard UMS message format
@cindex UMS Message Format

UMS uses only @strong{one} format for all messages. This makes it
possible to handle different kinds of networks, like FIDO or UUCP, with
one system. The user only needs to use message reader and all tools work
automatically with all messages. Messages can easily be exchanged between
different kinds of networks.

Messages from the outside have to be converted to this format before
handing them to UMS (importing). They also have to be converted from this
format when transferring messages from UMS to a network (exporting). These
conversions are handled by special programs called Importers or
Exporters. In UMS RFC the conversion is handled by the
@code{umsrfc.library} which is used by all programs.

@ref{RFC} addresses are mapped 1:1 to UMS addresses. Additionally UMS RFC
currently understands the following two UMS address formats. It can
convert them to and from @ref{RFC} addresses:

@table @code
@item <zone>:<hub>/<node>.<point>@@fidonet
FIDO (FTN) address format

@subsubsection Additional message information
@cindex Attributes

UMS RFC supports several parameters which can be  specified  in  the  UMS
message field @code{Attributes}:

@table @code
@item ALIAS
Use this alias for the address generation instead of @ref{rfc.username}.
UMS RFC checks if this alias is valid for the creator of the message.

@item RECEIPT-REQUEST
Send a receipt message to the specified address. This creates the
@ref{RFC} header @code{Return-Receipt-To}. The address may be specified
in one of the following four different forms:

@example
""                      - Creates address for sender of message
<name>                  - Creates address for local user
<account@@domain>        - Any address may be specified
<name>,<account@@domain> - Any address may be specfied
@end example

@item URGENT
Flag this message as urgent. This creates the following @ref{RFC} header:

@example
Priority: urgent
@end example
@end table

@node Conversion, , Attributes, Message Format
@subsubsection UMS <-> RFC conversion
@cindex Conversion
@cindex rfc.control

UMS itself is not a @ref{RFC} system, which means that all messages must
be transformed from the RFC format to the UMS format and vice versa. Not
every piece of RFC information is used or stored by UMS, so the importer
must preserve the original information. All RFC header fields which are
not known to the importer are preserved.

There are two exceptions to this rule:

@itemize @minus
@item
The order of the RFC header fields is not always preserved. Luckily, the
RFC standards do not impose a strict order for most of the header fields.

@item
If the message is a @ref{MIME} message and the importer can decode the
information, the exporter will not reconstruct the original message text.
Instead it will create new MIME headers which specify the new format.
@end itemize

The exporters use the additional information which is stored by the
importers to reconstruct the original messages. Here are some examples
where preserving of the information is needed:

@table @code
@item From
@itemx Reply-To
These RFC fields contain the address and maybe the real name of the user.
Since this information is stored in two separate UMS fields these lines
must be parsed to extract the needed information. This parsing process is
not reversible.

@item Newsgroups
Crosspostings are stored as hard-linked messages, which appear in
different groups. But an importer for a system may not have write access
to all groups in the crossposting, so exporters can't reconstruct this
line by reading all hard-linked messages.

@item References
UMS only uses one message ID for message threading.
@end table

Mapping of RFC headers to UMS fields:

@example
RFC header   | UMS fields                            | Preserved
----------------------------------------------------------------
Control      | - (cancel commands will be processed) |   Yes
Date         | Date & CDate                          |
Distribution | Distribution                          |
Followup-To  | ReplyGroup                            |
From         | FromAddr & FromName (MIME decoded)    |   Yes
In-Reply-To  | ReferID                               |   Yes
Message-ID   | MessageID                             |
Newsgroups   | Group (X messages hard linked)        |   Yes
Organization | Organization (MIME decoded)           |
References   | ReferID (the last id in the header)   |   Yes
Reply-To     | ReplyAddr & ReplyName (MIME decoded)  |   Yes
Subject      | Subject (MIME decoded)                |
X-Mailer     | Newsreader                            |
X-NewsReader | Newsreader                            |
<all others> | Comment                               |   Yes
@end example

All control messages will be written to a special newsgroup called
@samp{rfc.control}. You have to make sure that this newsgroup is included
in the @code{WRITEACCESS} pattern of the importer user entries. You can
allow the distribution of control messages by adding this newsgroup to
the @code{READACCESS} pattern of a exporter user entry.

Additional UMS fields used for creation of RFC headers during export:

@example
UMS field          | RFC header
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Attributes         | (miscellaneous)
LogicalToAddr/Name | To (mail only, superseeds ToAddr)
RfcAttr            | - (contents directly transferred into RFC message)
ToAddr/Name        | To (mail only, also used as physical address)

@subsection UMS message base
@cindex UMS Message Base

All UMS messages are stored in a message base. This is a special database
controlled by the @code{umsserver}. Knowledge about exact format of this
database is not needed by the users because they don't access it
directly. They have to go through the standard Interface
@code{ums.library}.

Multiple message bases can be active at the same time, each controlled by
its own @code{umsserver}. Even a message base on a remote machine can  be
accessed via network. All the user has to do is to specify  the  name  of
the message base:

@table @code
@item <name>
Use the specified message base on the local machine.

@item <name>@@<machine>
Use the specified message base on a remote machine using Envoy as network
software.

@item <machine>:<service>
@itemx <machine>:<port>
Access a message base on a remote machine using @ref{TCP/IP} as network
software. The message base will be specified with the configuration on the
remote machine.

@subsection Different types of users
@cindex Users

UMS differentiates three types of users:

@table @samp
@item Users
They can read and write messages, but they don't have any special rights.

@item System Operators
Users with special rights, also called SysOps. They may access the
headers of messages from other users to perform special tasks. Note that
they @strong{can't} read the message text itself, only the headers!

@item Exporters
Users with special read and write rights. They get read rights to all
messages which should be exported. They may also import messages from
remote systems.
@end table

UMS RFC needs one user with the name @samp{postmaster}. It will send all
error messages as mail to this user. Normally you should add the alias
@samp{postmaster} to a SysOp user entry.

@node Modes, , Users, UMS
@subsection UMS operation modes
@cindex UMS Operation Modes
@cindex Leaf Node
@cindex Full Node
@cindex Gateway

UMS can be operated in three different modes for news distribution:

@table @samp
@item Leaf node
The last system in a news message distribution chain. It imports news
messages from one or more remote systems, but doesn't export those news
messages to other systems. Only local news messages are exported to the
remote systems. Most users should use this mode, because it's very easy
to maintain.

To make UMS behave like a leaf node use

@example
( NodeMode "%")
@end example

@xref{rfc.noownfqdn}, for more information.

@item Full node
This node is located inside a news message distribution chain. It imports
news messages from remote systems and exports them to other remote
systems. The maintainer of such a system must control the message flow
between the systems very carefully in order to prevent loops and
duplicate messages. Only experienced users should use this mode.

With the UMS configuration variable @code{NodeMode} you can specify which
newsgroups should be handled by UMS in full node mode, e.g.

@example
( NodeMode "comp.#?" )
@end example

All messages in newsgroups whose names match this pattern may be read by
other exporters. The actual message flow between the systems is
controlled with the variable @code{READACCESS} in the exporter user
entries.

@item Gateway
Such a node behaves like a full node, but additionally it can distribute
news messages between networks with different technologies and newsgroup
names. Such systems are very delicate to handle, can cause many headaches
and create many enemies and flame wars. Only @strong{VERY VERY}
experienced users should use this mode. You have been warned!

To operate UMS as gateway you must have a special key, the @code{GateKey}.
@end table

This scheme is only applied to news messages, because they can generate a
very high amount of traffic in the networks. Mail messages are always
freely distributed between all systems.

there around 2000 RFC available, although some of the older ones have
been obsoleted by newer ones.

The following RFC define the standards for mail and news messages and
their transportation across networks.

@node Message Formats, MIME, , RFC
@subsection The standard RFC message formats
@cindex RFC Message Formats
@cindex RFC 822
@cindex RFC 1036

Two standards define the format of messages on the Internet:

@table @samp
@item RFC 822 (1982)
@itemx Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages
Defines the format of messages on the Internet. It is therefore the most
important standard for a RFC compliant messages handling system. A
message consists of two parts: the header and the body. They are
seperated by an empty line.

The header consists of non-empty lines with a keyword, followed by a
colon and the parameters. The standard defines many keywords, their
semantics and the syntax of their parameters. Especially it specifies the
format of time and address parameters. An example message header looks
like this:

@example
From: "Joe Dumb User" <jduser@@test.foo.bar>
To: "John Doe" <jd@@dummy.do.main>
Subject: Test message
Date: Fri, 26 May 1995 13:25:07 +0100
Message-ID: <54208434@@test.foo.bar>
@end example

The standard doesn't define any format for the mody of a message. The
only restriction is that only 7 Bit ASCII characters may be used. This
restriction may be circumvented with @ref{MIME}.

@item RFC 1036 (1987)
@itemx Standard for Interchange of USENET Messages

This is the extension of RFC 822 for news messages. It defines some new
keywords, like @code{Newsgroups} and @code{Path}. Also some of the many
allowed variants in RFC 822 are narrowed down to a usable set of options.
@end table

@node MIME, NNTP, Message Formats, RFC
@subsection Multi-Purpose Message Extensions
@cindex Multi-Purpose Message Extensions
@cindex MIME
@cindex RFC 1521
@cindex RFC 1522

RFC 822 concentrates on the format of the message headers and doesn't say
much about the format of the message body. The body may therefore only be
used for plain text. Additionally it allows only 7 Bit ASCII as charset
for messages.

These restrictions, especially when the biggest hype of the  90's  called
Multimedia hit the  message  handling  systems,  led  to  development  of
several extensions to RFC 822 called MIME:

@table @samp
@item RFC 1521 (1993)
@itemx MIME Part I: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing
@itemx the Format of Internet Message Bodies
This defines a structure for the message body. The body may contain
Non-ASCII text and binary data. The encoding of the message body for
transportation over non-transparent links is specified. Messages may be
composed of several different types of data. A mechanism for splitting up
large messages into several smaller ones is specified.

Additionally it defines some new RFC header fields which identify a MIME
message and specify the contents and the encoding of the message body.

@item RFC 1522 (1993)
@itemx MIME Part II: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text
Specifies the encoding of Non-ASCII text in RFC message headers. This
allows you to use such texts in subjects.
@end table

UMS RFC currently only supports  the  decoding  of  message  headers  and
bodies on import and the encoding of message bodies on export. So you may
use all  ISO-8859-1  characters  in  the  message  body,  like  @samp{ä},
@samp{á} and @samp{ß}.

@node NNTP, POP3, MIME, RFC
@subsection Network News Transfer Protocol
@cindex Network News Transfer Protocol
@cindex NNTP
@cindex RFC 977

USENET, the biggest news distribution system of the world, originally
used @ref{UUCP} as transportation mechanism. But with the advent of the
Internet with its online connections a new mechanism was needed. This led
to the development of the NNTP:

@table @samp
@item RFC 977 (1986)
@itemx Network News Transfer Protocol
This standard specifies a synchronous protocol between two news
exchanging entities, a client and a server. The client plays the active
role and sends commands, like @code{POST} or @code{GROUP}, to the server.
It then waits for a response of the server which contains status or error
codes or the news message. Only after that the client may send the next
command.

A special protocol is defined if the client is also a news server. The
client announces which new messages are available from its system and the
server can request or reject them. This lowers the network traffic
because messages are only transferred once even if there are multiple
redundant distribution paths available for a message.
@end table

During the recent years several inofficial extensions to NNTP have been
developed. Although not officially approved UMS RFC implements some of
most common or useful ones: extended header query (@code{XHDR}), overview
format (@code{XOVER}) and simple authentication
(@code{AUTHINFO USER/PASS}).

On systems where user mailboxes are not available network-wide because of

usually received by one host. This central server plays the role of a
post office which handles the mailboxes for its users. The server can be
accessed using POP3.

@itemx Post Office Protocol - Version 3
Defines the synchronous protocol between a server and a client. Note that
the client can only retrieve messages. For sending mail messages he has
to use another protocol like @ref{SMTP}.

First the client has to send the user name and the password to gain
access to the mailbox. The client may then retrieve messages from the
mailbox. It may also mark messages for deletion, but the server will
physically delete the messages only after the client has send the command
to close the connection.

One of the first applications for the Internet was the exchange  of  electronic
mail. Several protocols for transferring mail messages over networks have  been
defined, but the most commonly used one is SMTP and its extension ESMTP:

@table @samp
@item RFC 821 (1982)
@itemx Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
Defines a synchronous protocol between two mail exchanging entities. The
calling party plays the active role which can be changed during the
conversation, but this option seldomly used. For each mail the active
part first transmits the senders address and then a list with the
recipient addresses. These addresses are checked by the receiving side.
After that the mail message is transferred.

@cindex Protocol stack
@cindex TCP/IP

TCP/IP is the most commonly used abbreviation for protocol suite used on
the Internet. Although there are several other protocols in use the most
important are IP and TCP.

@table @samp
@item IP - Internet Protocol
Defines an unreliable, connectionless datagram service which is the base
for @emph{all} Internet protocols and services. IP datagrams contain a
destination adddress which enables the interconnecting systems to route a
datagram from the sender to the recipient. The addresses, the so called
IP numbers, are 32 Bit wide. The arrival and the order of the datagrams
is not guaranteed with IP.

IP can be used on many different types of network hardware. Examples are
Ethernet, FDDI, serial lines (SLIP, CSLIP or PPP) or X.25.

@item TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
Defines a reliable, connection oriented stream protocol. From the point
of the user the connection looks like a FIFO, that is the bytes arrive in
the same order as he sends them. TCP splits the stream into datagrams and
reassembles them at the receiving side. It also makes sure that the
datagrams are placed correctly when they arrive out of order. Lost or
errorneous datagrams are requested again from the sender.

@comment ----------------------------------------------------------------
@node UUCP, , RFC, Introduction
@section Unix to Unix CoPy
@cindex Unix to Unix CoPy
@cindex UUCP

UUCP was originally written to transfer files to a remote UNIX machine.
The syntax of the main command @code{uucp} is the same as the UNIX
@code{cp} command hence the name. Each file transfer request creates a
job which is stored in the so called spool directory for the remote
system.

At certain times the local machine checks if there are any files waiting
to be transferred to the remote system. It then starts the command
@code{uucico} (Unix to Unix Copy In Copy Out) which automatically
contacts the remote system via a modem line or a @ref{TCP/IP} connection.
The remote system then starts its own @code{uucico} and both programs
process their jobs and send the files forth and back.

Even remote command execution is possible with UUCP. To achieve this a
job with three files is created. Two of them are data files with the
prefix @file{D.}. One of these contains the data and the other the
commands how to process the data file on the remote system. The third
file with the prefix @file{C.} contains the commands for @code{uucico} to
send both files to the remote system.

The command file is renamed to a file with the prefix @file{X.} on the
remote system. After the connection has been closed @code{uucico} starts
the command @code{uuxqt} (Unix to Unix eXeCuTion?). It looks into the
spool directory for files with the prefix @file{X.} and processes the
commands.

This mechanism can be also used to transfer mail and news messages (The
news distribution system USENET was originally based on UUCP). The data
file contains a message in the @ref{Message Formats,RFC 822} format
and the command file contains mail and news processing commands, like
@code{rmail}.

Only mail messages are transferred in this way nowadays, because small
files degrade the performance of the file transfer. This can be avoided
if the data file contains several messages (batching). News messages can
simply be concatenated into one file, because they already contain the
message length in the header. For mail messages an adaption of the
@ref{SMTP} format is used, called Batched SMTP (BSMTP).

To reduce the amount of data which needs to be transferred batched files
are usually compressed. Currently in use are three compression methods:
compress, freeze and gzip. Normally only the plain output of those
programs is stored in the data file, but compressed news batches usually
contain a small text header which identifies the compression method.

@subsection Access rights for remote NNTP clients
@cindex nntpd.access

@table @code
@item nntpd.access
When a remote client tries to connect the @ref{NNTP} service the @ref{umsnntpd}
server daemon reads the contents of this variable to find out which access
rights the client has. The variable may contain multiple lines of the following
format:

@example
<Name pattern> <UMS user name>,<Post Y/N>,<Server Y/N>
@end example

The check is based on the domain name of the machine on which the client
runs. The patterns from the first line down to the last line will be used
to match the domain name. When a pattern matches then the access rights
of this entry are used for the client. If no pattern matches the access
is denied with an error message.

The account of the specified UMS user name is used to export and import
the news messages. If the second parameter is set to @code{Y} then
posting (that is importing) of news messages with the @code{POST} command
is allowed. If the third parameter is also set to @code{Y} then the
client is a @ref{NNTP} server and is allowed to use the @code{IHAVE}
command for transferring news messages.
@end table

Example:

@ifinfo
@example
( nntpd.access
   "localhost       NNTP1,Y,Y\\n"
   "*.ping.de       NNTP2,Y,N\\n"
   "*               NNTP3,N,N\\n" )
@end example
@end ifinfo
@iftex
@example
( nntpd.access
   "localhost       NNTP1,Y,Y\n"
   "*.ping.de       NNTP2,Y,N\n"
   "*               NNTP3,N,N\n" )
@end example
@end iftex

The above example allows full access for a client running on the local
machine. Clients running on machines in the domain @code{ping.de} are
allowed to post news messages. All other machines are only allowed to
read news messages. Using three different UMS users you can control which
newsgroups are visible for each of the three categories using the
@code{READACCESS} variable.

@end example

@item grade
Every @ref{UUCP} job has a grade which is one letter out of @code{0..9},
@code{A..Z} or @code{a..z}. It specifies the transfer priority for the job.
@code{0} has the highest priority and @code{z} the lowest. The default is
@code{A}.

@item batch
This optional parameter specifies if several mail message should be
merged into one file (batching).

@item compress command
Name of a command for the optional compression of the data files. Legal
values are @code{compress}, @code{freeze} and @code{gzip}. If you leave
this field empty the data files won't be compressed.

@item header
If this field is not empty, then the following header line will be
created in the data file:

@example
#! <header text>
@end example

Mail batches normally don't contain any headers, so you may leave this
field empty.

@item max size
Maximum size for one batch file. When it reaches this size it will be
closed and a new batch file will be used. The default size is 65536
bytes.
@end table
@end table

Example for unbatched, uncompressed mail:

@example
( uucp.mailexport "rmail" )

Example for batched, uncompressed mail, no header, batch size 65536 Bytes:

@example
( uucp.mailexport "rbsmtp,A,Y" )

@subsection Configuration for news batches
@cindex uucp.newsexport

@table @code
@item uucp.newsexport
This variable tells the @ref{UUCP} exporter @ref{ums2uucp} in which
format news messages should be exported. The syntax is as follows:

@example
<command>[,<grade>[,<batch>[,<compress command>[,<header>[,<max size>]]]]]
@end example

@table @code
@item command
Command name for the @code{C} line in the @ref{UUCP} command file. You
have to talk to the administrator of your host which commands his
software accepts and how it interprets them. Normally you should set this
to @code{rnews}.

@item grade
Every @ref{UUCP} job has a grade which is one letter out of @code{0..9},
@code{A..Z} or @code{a..z}. It specifies the transfer priority for the job.
@code{0} has the highest priority and @code{z} the lowest. The default is
@code{A}.

@item batch
This optional parameter specifies if several news message should be
merged into one file (batching). Usually non-batched news transfer is a
bad idea.

@item compress command
Name of a command for the optional compression of the data files. Legal
values are @code{compress}, @code{freeze} and @code{gzip}. If you leave
this field empty the data files won't be compressed.

@item header
If this field is not empty, then the following header line will be
created in the data file:

@example
#! <header text>
@end example

The following table shows some common header texts:

@example
Name     | Meaning
------------------------------------------------
cunbatch | batched, compressed (compress) news
funbatch | batched, compressed (freeze) news
gunbatch | batched, compressed (gzip) news
@end example

You should talk to the administrator of your host which headers and
compression types are supported by the software of the host system.

@item max size
Maximum size for one batch file. When it reaches this size it will be
closed and a new batch file will be used. The default size is 65536
bytes.

@subsection UUCP envelope type
@cindex uucp.envelope

@table @code
@item uucp.envelope
When exporting mail messages over @ref{UUCP} a so called ``envelope'' around
the message is sometimes required, e.g. if your mail is sent unbatched via
@code{rmail}. The following values are allowed for this variable:

@example
0  Don't generate an envelope
1  Generate a RFC 976 style UUCP envelope
2  Generate a normal UUCP envelope        (Default)
@end example

With a given address and date, a normal envelope looks like this:

@example
From <user>@@<domain> <date>
@end example

A RFC 976 envelope looks like this:

@example
From <user> <date> remote from <domain>
@end example

Ask the administrator of your host what envelope type is expected by the
software used on the host system.

@subsection Keep dupe messages
@cindex uucp.keepdupes

@table @code
@item uucp.keepdupes
Normally duplicate messages are flagged as error and the  @ref{UUCP}  job
is not deleted. Sometimes dupes can't be avoided, because @ref{UUCP} is
an offline protocol, that means there is no way to detect dupes on the
sending hosts. On a system with several hosts and high traffic this can
result in a high number of bad job files lying around, which do not
contain real errors. If you set this variable to @code{N} then bad jobs,
which had only dupe errors, are automatically deleted.

@subsection Mail routing configuration
@cindex uucp.mailroute

@table @code
@item uucp.mailroute
Sometimes it's important to specify static routes for outgoing mails.
Normally this variable is empty so NO routing information will be
generated. Each line in this variable consists of an address pattern and
a list of hosts:

@example
<address pattern> [<host1>[,<host2>....]]
@end example

When the recipient address matches the address pattern and the host list
is not empty, then the @ref{UUCP} exporter @ref{ums2uucp} will create an
explicit mail route. The route information will be added AFTER the
address conversion for non RFC compliant nets has been applied.

If the variable does contain several lines, then the patterns will be
tried from the first line down to the last line until one pattern
matches. If no pattern matches, then no route information will be
generated.
@end table

Example:

@ifinfo
@example
( uucp.mailroute "#?.maus.de        host1\\n"
                 "#?.zer.sub.org    host2,host3\\n"
                 "#?.fidonet.org\\n"
                 "#?.de             host4\\n" )
@end example
@end ifinfo
@iftex
@example
( uucp.mailroute "#?.maus.de        host1\n"
                 "#?.zer.sub.org    host2,host3\n"
                 "#?.fidonet.org\n"
                 "#?.de             host4\n" )
@end example
@end iftex

The following test cases:

@example
user@@box.maus.de
user@@box.zer.sub.org
user@@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org
user@@zauber.nase.de
user@@dummy.blubb.edu
@end example

are translated to the following mail routes for non-batched mail tranfer:

@example
C rmail host1!box.maus.de!user
C rmail host2!host3!box.zer.sub.org!user
C rmail user@@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org
C rmail host4!zauber.nase.de!user
C rmail user@@dummy.blubb.edu
@end example

and to the following mail routes for batched mail transfer:

@example
RCPT TO: <@@host1:user@@box.maus.de>
RCPT TO: <@@host2,@@host3:user@@box.zer.sub.org>
RCPT TO: <user@@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org>

@subsection Limit number of recipients
@cindex uucp.recipients

@table @code
@item uucp.recipients
Limits the number of recipients for one mail file. If there are more
recipients then the @ref{UUCP} exporter @ref{ums2uucp} will create
several mail files for one mail. The default is to put all recipients in
one mail file.
@end table

Example:

@example
( uucp.recipients 2 )
@end example

Using the above example on a mail with three recipients will result in
two separate mails to be send. If unbatched mail transfer is used then
the following two @code{C} lines are generated in the command files:

@example
C rmail usera@@test1.foo.bar,userb@@test2.foo.bar
C rmail userc@@test3.foo.bar
@end example

If batched  mail  transfer  is  used  then  the  following  commands  are
generated in the batch file:

@example
MAIL FROM: <user@@test.foo.bar>
RCPT TO: <usera@@test1.foo.bar>
RCPT TO: <userb@@test2.foo.bar>
DATA
...

                [-c]
                [-r <n>]
                [-w <n>]

Defaults:

                 -S  Service @samp{nntp} (port 119)
                 -p  No password
                 -s  Default message base

                 -r  360
                 -w  60
@end example

Explanation of the command line options:

@table @samp
@item -n
This name is send to the remote server if it requests user
authentication. Note that the name is send in clear text!

@item -i
This string is send to the remote server if the user authentication also
requires a password. Note that the password is send in clear text!

@item -b
Bit number of an additional select bit. Only messages with this bit set
in the user flags will be exported. This can be used to run a special
filter program before exporting with @code{umsnntp}.

@item -I
Use the @code{IHAVE} command to send the news messages to the remote
host. If you don't specify this option, then the @code{POST} command is
used. Most @ref{NNTP} servers don't allow the @code{IHAVE} command for
clients, so you may not be able to use this option.

@item -c
Export news messages continously. After exporting all new messages
@code{umsnntp} will wait a short while and then will start to export all new
messages which arrived in the meantime.

@item -r
Causes @code{umsnntp} to rescan the whole message base for new messages
after @var{n} export runs. All messages which couldn't be sent until now
will be sent again. This option is only useful in conjunction with
@samp{-c}.

@item -w
Causes @code{umsnntp} to wait @var{n} seconds between two export runs.
This option is only useful inconjunction with @samp{-c}.

@end example

Explanation of the command line options:

@table @samp
@item -n
This name is send to the remote server if it requests user
authentication. Note that the name is send in clear text!

@item -i
This string is send to the remote server if the user authentication also
requires a password. Note that the password is send in clear text!

@item -g
Use the commands @code{GROUP}, @code{STAT} and @code{NEXT} to scan for
new news messages. This may lower the load on the remote @ref{NNTP}
server but the transfer overhead may be significantely higher, especially
if the server uses long expiration periods for news messages. If you
don't specify this option the command @code{NEWNEWS} is used which only
transfers information about new messages (@pxref{setnntpdate}).

@item -P
Use @var{n} (up to 20) parallel processes to transfer news messages. This
is useful to make the transfer of news messages over a slow serial link
more efficient by using most of the available bandwidth.

@item -c
Use parameters on the command line after the last valid command line
option as input parameters. You may request news messages by message ID:

@example
umsnntpget -h nntphost -c 1234@@dummy.do.main 6789@@test.foo.bar
@end example

or by group names:

@example
umsnntpget -h nntphost -c -g comp.sys.amiga.misc comp.sys.amiga.datacomm

The command @code{umssmtp} exports mail messages via @ref{SMTP} to a
remote host.

@example
Syntax:

        umssmtp  -h <remote host>
                [-S <Service name or port number>]

                [-p <UMS password>]

                [-c]
                [-r <n>]
                [-w <n>]

Defaults:

                 -S  Service @samp{smtp} (port 25)
                 -p  No password
                 -s  Default message base

                 -r  360
                 -w  60
@end example

Explanation of the command line options:

@table @samp
@item -b
Bit number of an additional select bit. Only messages with this bit set
in the user flags will be exported. This can be used to run a special
filter program before exporting with @code{umssmtp}.

@item -c
Export mail messages continously. After exporting all new messages
@code{umssmtp} will wait a short time and then will start to export all new
messages which arrived in the meantime.

@item -r
Causes @code{umssmtp} to rescan the whole message base for new messages
after @var{n} export runs. All messages which couldn't be sent until now
will be sent again. This option is only useful in conjunction with
@samp{-c}.

@item -w
Causes @code{umssmtp} to wait @var{n} seconds between two export runs.
This option is only useful inconjunction with @samp{-c}.
@end table

See also @ref{UMS options} and @ref{Protocol options}.

When @code{umssmtp} connects to a @ref{SMTP} server it tries to use
@ref{SMTP,ESMTP} first. If this succeeds then @code{umssmtp} controls its
actions according to the options offered by the server:

@table @samp
@item SIZE
It will tell the server how big the messages are before transferring them.

@item 8BITMIME
It will tell the server which encoding type the message body has before
transferring it.

@item PIPELINING
Commands and responses will be queued to improve performance.

@cindex umsrfcprint

The command @code{umsrfcprint} prints @ref{UMS} messages as @ref{RFC} messages
to the standard output. You can use the output redirection (@file{>file}) to
write messages into a file. The printed messages will @emph{not} be marked as
read. This tool is very helpful when you want to know how the exported message
will look like.

@example
Syntax:

        umsrfcprint  <UMS user name>
                     <UMS password>
                    [<UMS message base>]

Explanation of the command line options:

@table @samp
@item MSGNUM
Specifies which @ref{UMS} message should be printed.

@item DOTS
Some protocols like @ref{NNTP}, @ref{POP3} and @ref{SMTP} require a special
encoding of lines beginning with a "." (dot). With this option you can enable
this encoding.

@section Import RFC messages as UMS messages
@cindex Import RFC messages as UMS messages
@cindex umsrfcwrite

The command @code{umsrfcwrite} reads @ref{RFC} messages and imports them as
@ref{UMS} messages. You can use the input redirection (@file{<file}) or the
@code{FILE} parameter to read messages from a file. This tool is very helpful
when you want to import messages from other RFC tools.

@example
Syntax:

        umsrfcwrite  <UMS user name>
                     <UMS password>
                    [<UMS message base>]
                    [FILE <filename>]
                    [DOTS]
                    [<recipient1> ...]

Defaults:

                     Default message base
                     Read message from standard input
                     Don't decode lines beginning with a dot
                     Import news message
@end example

Explanation of the command line options:

@table @samp
@item FILE
Specifies from which file the @ref{RFC} message should be read instead from the
standard input.

@item DOTS
Some protocols like @ref{NNTP}, @ref{POP3} and @ref{SMTP} require a special
decoding of lines beginning with a "." (dot). With this option you can enable
this decoding. Note that the last line containing only a single dot must have
been removed already!
@end table

If you don't specify any recipient addresses then the message will be imported
as news message. If you specify one or more addresses the message will imported
as mail message with the addresses as recipients.

Note that @code{umsrfcwrite} does @emph{not} transform the @code{CR-LF}
combination to @code{LF}. Thus you have to perform this transformation
yourself before importing the message with this tool!

Examples:

@example
umsrfcwrite importer secret FILE mail.txt DOTS jduser@@dummy.test.com
umsrfcwrite <news.txt importer secret
@end example

This system receives all messages from the node @code{dummy}. It will
send out unbatched mail messages and batched, compressed news messages to
the node @code{dummy}. The transmission link to the remote node is
transparent, so no encoding is needed. The users on this system will have
the address

@example
<user>@@test.foo.bar
@end example

To poll the node @code{dummy} with @ref{UUCP} the user has to use the
following commands:

@example
ums2uucp -h dummy
uucico -sdummy
@end example

To send out mail and news message via @ref{TCP/IP} and to fetch mail
messages the user has to use the following commands:

@section Main UUCP configuration
@cindex UUCP Configuration

The file @file{UULIB:config} contains the @ref{UUCP} configuration. A minimal
configuration only needs your node name, a dummy user name and a setting for
the debug level:

@example
NodeName    foobar
UserName    root
Debug       0
@end example

@section UUCP ports description
@cindex UUCP ports description

The file @file{UULIB:L.Ports} describes the devices which @code{uucico} uses to
contact remote systems. Normally this is a serial port with a modem, so the
file should look like this:

@example
acu=ser device=serial.device unit=0
@end example

If you want to use @ref{UUCP} over @ref{TCP/IP} you must add another device to
this file:

@example
acu=tcp device=telser.device unit=0
@end example

@section Remote UUCP Systems
@cindex Remote UUCP Systems

The file @file{UULIB:L.Sys} describes how @code{uucico} can contact remote
systems. This includes the device to use, the serial line speed, the phone
number and the login script:

@example
dummy    Any   ser   19200    ATDP123456  ogin: foobar ssword: hello
@end example

To contact a remote system with @ref{UUCP} over @ref{TCP/IP} you replace the
phone number with the hostname of the remote system. So the line should look
like this:

@example
dummy    Any   tcp   19200    dummy    ogin: foobar ssword: hello
@end example

@section UUCP poll script
@cindex UUCP poll script

The following script first exports all messages to the remote system and then
contacts it. You can specify the name of the remote system as parameter:

@example
.KEY SYSTEM
.DEF SYSTEM dummy
.BRA @{
.KET @}

ums2uucp -h @{SYSTEM@}
uucico -s@{SYSTEM@}
@end example

@section Telser configuration
@cindex Telser Configuration

The file @file{AMITCP:db/telser.conf} describes the configuration for every
unit of the @code{telser.device}. For the unit 0 it should look like this:

@example
0  ""    NoOperation NOOPENWIN NOLINGER NODEBUG T:telser.log
@end example

@node Hosts, , Telser, Examples
@section Host descriptions
@cindex Host Descripions

The file @file{AMITCP:db/telser.hosts} contains the descriptions of the remote
systems. If you @emph{dial} a remote system using the @code{telser.device} it
looks into this file to find out the hostname and the parameters. For our
example system it looks like this:

@example
dummy    dummy.do.main  540   ""    00000000001
@end example

Please make sure that the 11th bit is set, because it activates the transparent
mode of @code{telser.device} which is a @strong{must} for @ref{UUCP} over
@ref{TCP/IP}.

@appendix The author wants to thank
@cindex Credits

I want to thank all users of the public beta version for testing this
package. Especially I want to thank Matthias Scheler and Bernhard
Möllemann who tested intermediate versions on their systems. Many thanks
also to the members of the @code{UMS-Dev} mailing list for the
discussions and the ideas.

Thanks go to Kai `wusel' Siering for allowing me to include his version
of @code{uucico} in this package. You may find the latest version of the
program in his @ref{UUCP} package called @code{wUUCP} on Aminet in the
directory @file{comm/uucp}.

Thanks also to Sam Yee for allowing me to include parts of his
@code{telser} package. You may find the latest version of his package on
Aminet in the directory @file{comm/tcp}. @code{telser} is Shareware, so
if you use it regularly @strong{PLEASE} do register it!

Thanks go to Kai Bolay for the original Installer script and the
UMS Installation ARexx tools.

Thanks also to Hartmut Goebel for allowing me to include his
@code{rexxdossupport.library} (Copyright @copyright{} 1994--1996 Hartmut
Goebel) in this package. This library is required for the UMS
Installation ARexx tools. The latest version of this package can be found
on Aminet in @file{util/rexx/rexxdossupport.lha}.
