  Guidelines for file names, directories and archives for UMS programs


  I. Introduction

The UMS project is based on the team work of many individual programmers.
This has  led  to  some  chaos  regarding  file  names,  directories  and
archives. This text is a guideline for all who want to release a  package
for the UMS project. The ultimate goal should be that  the  complete  UMS
project gets an uniform structure. The users will hopefully  be  grateful
:-)


  II. Directory structure and file names

All programs, which are related to the UMS project,  are  joined  in  one
directory with the name "UMS". Due to the uniform structure every program
gets its unique location. The names  of  the  subdirectories  should  NOT
contain the name "UMS" anymore.

Documentation files may only be located in the  directory  "UMS/Doc".  In
this directory are several subdirectories for  different  languages.  The
suffix of the file name specifies the type of the document file:

   .dvi    - DVI
   .guide  - AmigaGuide
   .tex    - TeX oder Texinfo
   .txt    - ASCII

Example:

   UMS/Doc/english/IntuiNews.guide
   UMS/Doc/deutsch/IntuiNews.dvi

All programs and AmigaDOS script  files  are  located  in  the  directory
"UMS/Bin". This makes it easy for the user to start them, because he only
has to add "Path UMS/Bin Add" or "Assign C: UMS/Bin Add" to  his  startup
scripts.

Directory "UMS":

   UMS/Bin        - UMS programs und AmigaDOS script files
   UMS/Developer  - Informations for programmers
   UMS/Devs       - Devices
   UMS/Doc        - Documentation for UMS programs
   UMS/Install    - Script files for Installer
   UMS/L          - All files, which belong into L:
   UMS/Libs       - Libraries
   UMS/Locale     - Catalogs, same directory structure as in LOCALE:
   UMS/Networks   - Network specific Im/Exporters
   UMS/Reader     - Message reader
   UMS/Rexx       - UMS ARexx script files
   UMS/S          - Additions for S:User-Startup
   UMS/Tools      - All programs which do not belong to Networks/Reader

The directories Networks, Reader and Tools contain the  program  packages
for the UMS project. Every program has its own subdirectory.

Example:

   UMS/Networks/FTN
   UMS/Networks/Maus
   UMS/Networks/QWK
   UMS/Networks/RFC
   UMS/Networks/Zer

The program packages have several uniform directories for  the  different
file types:

   src  - Source code

Example:

   UMS/Networks/RFC/src/uucpexporter/DMakefile

If a package includes the source code for the program then the programmer
can use the knowledge about the UMS directory in his  Makefiles.  He  can
use relative path names,  e.g.  INCDIR  =  ////Developer/c/include.  This
eases the compilation process for the user.

Directory "Developer":

   UMS/Developer/c                    - Subdirectory for C
   UMS/Developer/c/dlib               - Link libraries for DICE
   UMS/Developer/c/dlib/ums           - Source for the DICE link libraries
   UMS/Developer/c/examples/ums       - Example programs in C
   UMS/Developer/c/include/clib       - Function prototypes
   UMS/Developer/c/include/libraries  - Include files
   UMS/Developer/c/include/pragmas    - Declarations for inline calls
   UMS/Developer/c/include/proto      - Proto files
   UMS/Developer/c/slib               - Link libraries for SAS/C
   UMS/Developer/c/slib/ums           - Source for the SAS/C link libraries
   UMS/Developer/doc/deutsch          - Documentation in German
   UMS/Developer/doc/english          - Documentation in Englisch
   UMS/Developer/fd                   - FD files
   UMS/Developer/m2                   - Subdirectory for Modula-2
   UMS/Developer/m2/examples          - Example programs in Modula-2
   UMS/Developer/oberon               - Subdirectory for Oberon
   UMS/Developer/oberon/examples      - Example programs in Oberon


  III. Program archives

Archives should use the same directory structure as  the  UMS  directory.
This makes the installation process very easy, because the user just  has
to unpack the archive and the files will  be  located  in  their  correct
directory. The archives should not contain  any  files  which  belong  to
other UMS archives.

Example:

   1> lha vq UMSRFC1_0.lha
   UMS/Bin/ums2uucp
   UMS/Bin/uuxqt
   ...
   UMS/Doc/english/umsrfc.dvi
   UMS/Doc/english/umsrfc.guide
   UMS/Doc/english/umsrfc.txt
   ...
   UMS/Libs/umsrfc.library
   ...
   UMS/Networks/RFC/src/nntpserver/DMakefile
   ...

The name of the archive should start with "UMS". If there is no danger of
mixing it up with another program then this prefix may be left  out.  The
name should always include the version, revision and the patch level (one
lowercase letter) of the program. They should be appended to the name of
the package like this:

   <version>_<revision><patch level>

The last element of the name ist the suffix for the archiv format.

Example:

   UMS12_1.lha
   UMSRFC1_0.lha
   IntuiNews2_0a.lha
   UMSConf3_0.lha


  IV. The archive "UMSDirStruct1_0.lha"

To ease the work for programmers an archive  exists  which  includes  all
standard directory and the needed icons. The  programmer  only  needs  to
unpack the archive and move his files to the appropriate places. Then  he
removes all superfluous icon files  and  archives  the  directory  (empty
directories will automatically be left out of the archive).
