DISTRIBUTION
============

   This software package is freely distributable. It  may  be
transfered  to  any media which is used for the distribution of free
software  like  Public  Domain disk collections, CDROMs, FTP servers or
bulletin board systems.

   In order to ensure the integrity of this software package
distributors should use the original archive file @{b}umsrfc1_0.lha@{ub} (file
name on Aminet: @{b}umsrfc.lha@{ub}). The author cannot be made responsible if
this software package has become unusable due to modifications of the
archive contents or of the archive file itself.

   There is no limit on the fee taken by distributors, e.g. for the
media costs of floppy disks, streamer tapes or compact discs, or the
process  of  duplicating.  Such limits have proven to be harmful  to
the  idea  of  freely  distributable software, e.g. the software
package was removed instead of reducing  the  price of a floppy disk
below the limit.

   Although the author does not impose any limit on these fees he
would  like  to express his personal opinions on this matter:

   @{b}*@{ub} This software package should be made  available  to  everyone
     free  of  charge whenever this is possible.

   @{b}*@{ub} If you have purchased this software package  under  normal
     conditions  from  a Public Domain dealer on a floppy disk and have
     paid more than 5DM or US $5 then you have definitely paid too
     much. Please don't support  this  improper  profit making any
     longer and switch to a cheaper source as soon as possible.

USAGE RESTRICTIONS
==================

   No program, document, data file or source  code  from  this
software  package, neither in whole nor in part, may be used on any
machine which is used

   @{b}*@{ub} for the research, development, construction, testing or production
     of  weapons or other military applications. This also includes
     any machine which is used in the education for any of the above
     mentioned purposes.

   @{b}*@{ub} by people who accept, support  or  use  violence  against  other
     people,  e.g.  citizens from foreign countries.

Standard UMS message format
---------------------------

   UMS uses only @{i}one@{ui} format for all messages. This makes it possible to
handle different kinds of networks, like FIDO or UUCP, with one system.
The user only needs to use message reader and all tools work
automatically with all messages. Messages can easily be exchanged
between different kinds of networks.

   Messages from the outside have to be converted to this format before
handing them to UMS (importing). They also have to be converted from
this format when transferring messages from UMS to a network
(exporting). These conversions are handled by special programs called
Importers or Exporters. In UMS RFC the conversion is handled by the
@{b}umsrfc.library@{ub} which is used by all programs.

UMS address formats
...................

@{"RFC" Link "RFC"} addresses are mapped 1:1 to UMS addresses. Additionally UMS RFC
currently understands the following two UMS address formats. It can
convert them to and from @{"RFC" Link "RFC"} addresses:

@{b}<zone>:<hub>/<node>.<point>@fidonet@{ub}
     FIDO (FTN) address format

@{b}<box>.maus@{ub}
     Maus address format


@EndNode

@Node "Attributes" "umsrfc.guide/Attributes"
@Next "Conversion"
@Prev "Addresses"
@Toc "Message Format"

Additional message information
..............................

   UMS RFC supports several parameters which can be  specified  in  the
UMS message field @{b}Attributes@{ub}:

@{b}ALIAS@{ub}
     Use this alias for the address generation instead of @{"rfc.username" Link "rfc.username"}.
     UMS RFC checks if this alias is valid for the creator of the
     message.

@{b}RECEIPT-REQUEST@{ub}
     Send a receipt message to the specified address. This creates the
     @{"RFC" Link "RFC"} header @{b}Return-Receipt-To@{ub}. The address may be specified in one
     of the following four different forms:

          ""                      - Creates address for sender of message
          <name>                  - Creates address for local user
          <account@domain>        - Any address may be specified
          <name>,<account@domain> - Any address may be specfied

@{b}URGENT@{ub}
     Flag this message as urgent. This creates the following @{"RFC" Link "RFC"} header:

          Priority: urgent


@EndNode

@Node "Conversion" "umsrfc.guide/Conversion"
@Prev "Attributes"
@Toc "Message Format"

UMS <-> RFC conversion
......................

   UMS itself is not a @{"RFC" Link "RFC"} system, which means that all messages must
be transformed from the RFC format to the UMS format and vice versa. Not
every piece of RFC information is used or stored by UMS, so the importer
must preserve the original information. All RFC header fields which are
not known to the importer are preserved.

   There are two exceptions to this rule:

   - The order of the RFC header fields is not always preserved.
     Luckily, the RFC standards do not impose a strict order for most
     of the header fields.

   - If the message is a @{"MIME" Link "MIME"} message and the importer can decode the
     information, the exporter will not reconstruct the original
     message text.  Instead it will create new MIME headers which
     specify the new format.

   The exporters use the additional information which is stored by the
importers to reconstruct the original messages. Here are some examples
where preserving of the information is needed:

@{b}From@{ub}
@{b}Reply-To@{ub}
     These RFC fields contain the address and maybe the real name of
     the user.  Since this information is stored in two separate UMS
     fields these lines must be parsed to extract the needed
     information. This parsing process is not reversible.

@{b}Newsgroups@{ub}
     Crosspostings are stored as hard-linked messages, which appear in
     different groups. But an importer for a system may not have write
     access to all groups in the crossposting, so exporters can't
     reconstruct this line by reading all hard-linked messages.

@{b}References@{ub}
     UMS only uses one message ID for message threading.

   Mapping of RFC headers to UMS fields:

     RFC header   | UMS fields                            | Preserved
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Control      | - (cancel commands will be processed) |   Yes
     Date         | Date & CDate                          |
     Distribution | Distribution                          |
     Followup-To  | ReplyGroup                            |
     From         | FromAddr & FromName (MIME decoded)    |   Yes
     In-Reply-To  | ReferID                               |   Yes
     Message-ID   | MessageID                             |
     Newsgroups   | Group (X messages hard linked)        |   Yes
     Organization | Organization (MIME decoded)           |
     References   | ReferID (the last id in the header)   |   Yes
     Reply-To     | ReplyAddr & ReplyName (MIME decoded)  |   Yes
     Subject      | Subject (MIME decoded)                |
     X-Mailer     | Newsreader                            |
     X-NewsReader | Newsreader                            |
     <all others> | Comment                               |   Yes

   All control messages will be written to a special newsgroup called
@{b}rfc.control@{ub}. You have to make sure that this newsgroup is included in
the @{b}WRITEACCESS@{ub} pattern of the importer user entries. You can allow the
distribution of control messages by adding this newsgroup to the
@{b}READACCESS@{ub} pattern of a exporter user entry.

   Additional UMS fields used for creation of RFC headers during export:

     UMS field          | RFC header
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Attributes         | (miscellaneous)
     LogicalToAddr/Name | To (mail only, superseeds ToAddr)
     RfcAttr            | - (contents directly transferred into RFC message)
     ToAddr/Name        | To (mail only, also used as physical address)

UMS message base
----------------

   All UMS messages are stored in a message base. This is a special
database controlled by the @{b}umsserver@{ub}. Knowledge about exact format of
this database is not needed by the users because they don't access it
directly. They have to go through the standard Interface @{b}ums.library@{ub}.

   Multiple message bases can be active at the same time, each
controlled by its own @{b}umsserver@{ub}. Even a message base on a remote
machine can  be accessed via network. All the user has to do is to
specify  the  name  of the message base:

@{b}<name>@{ub}
     Use the specified message base on the local machine.

@{b}<name>@<machine>@{ub}
     Use the specified message base on a remote machine using Envoy as
     network software.

@{b}<machine>:<service>@{ub}
@{b}<machine>:<port>@{ub}
     Access a message base on a remote machine using @{"TCP-IP" Link "TCP-IP"} as network
     software. The message base will be specified with the
     configuration on the remote machine.

Different types of users
------------------------

   UMS differentiates three types of users:

@{b}Users@{ub}
     They can read and write messages, but they don't have any special
     rights.

@{b}System Operators@{ub}
     Users with special rights, also called SysOps. They may access the
     headers of messages from other users to perform special tasks.
     Note that they @{i}can't@{ui} read the message text itself, only the
     headers!

@{b}Exporters@{ub}
     Users with special read and write rights. They get read rights to
     all messages which should be exported. They may also import
     messages from remote systems.

   UMS RFC needs one user with the name @{b}postmaster@{ub}. It will send all
error messages as mail to this user. Normally you should add the alias
@{b}postmaster@{ub} to a SysOp user entry.


@EndNode

@Node "Modes" "umsrfc.guide/Modes"
@Prev "Users"
@Toc "UMS"

UMS operation modes
-------------------

   UMS can be operated in three different modes for news distribution:

@{b}Leaf node@{ub}
     The last system in a news message distribution chain. It imports
     news messages from one or more remote systems, but doesn't export
     those news messages to other systems. Only local news messages are
     exported to the remote systems. Most users should use this mode,
     because it's very easy to maintain.

     To make UMS behave like a leaf node use

          ( NodeMode "%")

     See @{"rfc.noownfqdn" Link "rfc.noownfqdn"}, for more information.

@{b}Full node@{ub}
     This node is located inside a news message distribution chain. It
     imports news messages from remote systems and exports them to
     other remote systems. The maintainer of such a system must control
     the message flow between the systems very carefully in order to
     prevent loops and duplicate messages. Only experienced users
     should use this mode.

     With the UMS configuration variable @{b}NodeMode@{ub} you can specify which
     newsgroups should be handled by UMS in full node mode, e.g.

          ( NodeMode "comp.#?" )

     All messages in newsgroups whose names match this pattern may be
     read by other exporters. The actual message flow between the
     systems is controlled with the variable @{b}READACCESS@{ub} in the exporter
     user entries.

@{b}Gateway@{ub}
     Such a node behaves like a full node, but additionally it can
     distribute news messages between networks with different
     technologies and newsgroup names. Such systems are very delicate
     to handle, can cause many headaches and create many enemies and
     flame wars. Only @{i}VERY VERY@{ui} experienced users should use this mode.
     You have been warned!

     To operate UMS as gateway you must have a special key, the @{b}GateKey@{ub}.

   This scheme is only applied to news messages, because they can
generate a very high amount of traffic in the networks. Mail messages
are always freely distributed between all systems.

Request for comments
====================

   RFC are standards which define the Internet technology. Each RFC has
a unique number by which it can be identified, e.g. RFC 822. Currently
there around 2000 RFC available, although some of the older ones have
been obsoleted by newer ones.

   The following RFC define the standards for mail and news messages and
their transportation across networks.


Format standards:

 @{" Message Formats " Link "Message Formats"}   The standard RFC message formats
 @{" MIME " Link "MIME"}              Multi-Purpose Message Extensions

Service standards:

 @{" NNTP " Link "NNTP"}              Network News Transfer Protocol
 @{" POP3 " Link "POP3"}              Post Office Protocol (Version 3)
 @{" SMTP " Link "SMTP"}              Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

@EndNode

The standard RFC message formats
--------------------------------

   Two standards define the format of messages on the Internet:

@{b}RFC 822 (1982)@{ub}
@{b}Standard for the format of ARPA Internet text messages@{ub}
     Defines the format of messages on the Internet. It is therefore
     the most important standard for a RFC compliant messages handling
     system. A message consists of two parts: the header and the body.
     They are seperated by an empty line.

     The header consists of non-empty lines with a keyword, followed by
     a colon and the parameters. The standard defines many keywords,
     their semantics and the syntax of their parameters. Especially it
     specifies the format of time and address parameters. An example
     message header looks like this:

          From: "Joe Dumb User" <jduser@test.foo.bar>
          To: "John Doe" <jd@dummy.do.main>
          Subject: Test message
          Date: Fri, 26 May 1995 13:25:07 +0100
          Message-ID: <54208434@test.foo.bar>

     The standard doesn't define any format for the mody of a message.
     The only restriction is that only 7 Bit ASCII characters may be
     used. This restriction may be circumvented with @{"MIME" Link "MIME"}.

@{b}RFC 1036 (1987)@{ub}
@{b}Standard for Interchange of USENET Messages@{ub}
     This is the extension of RFC 822 for news messages. It defines
     some new keywords, like @{b}Newsgroups@{ub} and @{b}Path@{ub}. Also some of the many
     allowed variants in RFC 822 are narrowed down to a usable set of
     options.


@EndNode

@Node "MIME" "umsrfc.guide/MIME"
@Next "NNTP"

@Toc "RFC"

Multi-Purpose Message Extensions
--------------------------------

   RFC 822 concentrates on the format of the message headers and
doesn't say much about the format of the message body. The body may
therefore only be used for plain text. Additionally it allows only 7
Bit ASCII as charset for messages.

   These restrictions, especially when the biggest hype of the  90's
called Multimedia hit the  message  handling  systems,  led  to
development  of several extensions to RFC 822 called MIME:

@{b}RFC 1521 (1993)@{ub}
@{b}MIME Part I: Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing@{ub}
@{b}the Format of Internet Message Bodies@{ub}
     This defines a structure for the message body. The body may contain
     Non-ASCII text and binary data. The encoding of the message body
     for transportation over non-transparent links is specified.
     Messages may be composed of several different types of data. A
     mechanism for splitting up large messages into several smaller
     ones is specified.

     Additionally it defines some new RFC header fields which identify
     a MIME message and specify the contents and the encoding of the
     message body.

@{b}RFC 1522 (1993)@{ub}
@{b}MIME Part II: Message Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text@{ub}
     Specifies the encoding of Non-ASCII text in RFC message headers.
     This allows you to use such texts in subjects.

   UMS RFC currently only supports  the  decoding  of  message  headers
and bodies on import and the encoding of message bodies on export. So
you may use all  ISO-8859-1  characters  in  the  message  body,  like
@{b}ä@{ub}, @{b}á@{ub} and @{b}ß@{ub}.

Network News Transfer Protocol
------------------------------

   USENET, the biggest news distribution system of the world, originally
used @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} as transportation mechanism. But with the advent of the
Internet with its online connections a new mechanism was needed. This
led to the development of the NNTP:

@{b}RFC 977 (1986)@{ub}
@{b}Network News Transfer Protocol@{ub}
     This standard specifies a synchronous protocol between two news
     exchanging entities, a client and a server. The client plays the
     active role and sends commands, like @{b}POST@{ub} or @{b}GROUP@{ub}, to the server.
     It then waits for a response of the server which contains status
     or error codes or the news message. Only after that the client may
     send the next command.

     A special protocol is defined if the client is also a news server.
     The client announces which new messages are available from its
     system and the server can request or reject them. This lowers the
     network traffic because messages are only transferred once even if
     there are multiple redundant distribution paths available for a
     message.

   During the recent years several inofficial extensions to NNTP have
been developed. Although not officially approved UMS RFC implements
some of most common or useful ones: extended header query (@{b}XHDR@{ub}),
overview format (@{b}XOVER@{ub}) and simple authentication (@{b}AUTHINFO USER/PASS@{ub}).

Post Office Protocol (Version 3)
--------------------------------

   On systems where user mailboxes are not available network-wide
because of a missing network file system or security reasons the mail
messages are usually received by one host. This central server plays
the role of a post office which handles the mailboxes for its users.
The server can be accessed using POP3.

@{b}RFC 1081 (1988)@{ub}
@{b}Post Office Protocol - Version 3@{ub}
     Defines the synchronous protocol between a server and a client.
     Note that the client can only retrieve messages. For sending mail
     messages he has to use another protocol like @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"}.

     First the client has to send the user name and the password to gain
     access to the mailbox. The client may then retrieve messages from
     the mailbox. It may also mark messages for deletion, but the
     server will physically delete the messages only after the client
     has send the command to close the connection.

   Most systems which use POP3 don't have their own domain name.  See
@{"rfc.noownfqdn" Link "rfc.noownfqdn"}.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
-----------------------------

   One of the first applications for the Internet was the exchange  of
electronic mail. Several protocols for transferring mail messages over
networks have  been defined, but the most commonly used one is SMTP and
its extension ESMTP:

@{b}RFC 821 (1982)@{ub}
@{b}Simple Mail Transfer Protocol@{ub}
     Defines a synchronous protocol between two mail exchanging
     entities. The calling party plays the active role which can be
     changed during the conversation, but this option seldomly used.
     For each mail the active part first transmits the senders address
     and then a list with the recipient addresses. These addresses are
     checked by the receiving side.  After that the mail message is
     transferred.

@{b}RFC 1652 (1994)@{ub}
@{b}SMTP Service Extension for 8bit-MIMEtransport@{ub}
     Defines the extension to exchange information about message body
     encoding.

@{b}RFC 1854 (1995)@{ub}
@{b}SMTP Service Extension for Command Pipelining@{ub}
     Defines the extension how to queue SMTP commands and responses in
     order to eliminate turnarounds and thus improving performance.

@{b}RFC 1869 (1995)@{ub}
@{b}SMTP Service Extensions@{ub}
     Defines the means to extend SMTP.

@{b}RFC 1870 (1995)@{ub}
@{b}SMTP Service Extension for Message Size Declaration@{ub}
     Defines the extension to exchange information about message size
     and message size limits.

Internet protocol stack
-----------------------

   TCP/IP is the most commonly used abbreviation for protocol suite
used on the Internet. Although there are several other protocols in use
the most important are IP and TCP.

@{b}IP - Internet Protocol@{ub}
     Defines an unreliable, connectionless datagram service which is
     the base for @{i}all@{ui} Internet protocols and services. IP datagrams
     contain a destination adddress which enables the interconnecting
     systems to route a datagram from the sender to the recipient. The
     addresses, the so called IP numbers, are 32 Bit wide. The arrival
     and the order of the datagrams is not guaranteed with IP.

     IP can be used on many different types of network hardware.
     Examples are Ethernet, FDDI, serial lines (SLIP, CSLIP or PPP) or
     X.25.

@{b}TCP - Transmission Control Protocol@{ub}
     Defines a reliable, connection oriented stream protocol. From the
     point of the user the connection looks like a FIFO, that is the
     bytes arrive in the same order as he sends them. TCP splits the
     stream into datagrams and reassembles them at the receiving side.
     It also makes sure that the datagrams are placed correctly when
     they arrive out of order. Lost or errorneous datagrams are
     requested again from the sender.

Unix to Unix CoPy
=================

   UUCP was originally written to transfer files to a remote UNIX
machine.  The syntax of the main command @{b}uucp@{ub} is the same as the UNIX
@{b}cp@{ub} command hence the name. Each file transfer request creates a job
which is stored in the so called spool directory for the remote system.

   At certain times the local machine checks if there are any files
waiting to be transferred to the remote system. It then starts the
command @{b}uucico@{ub} (Unix to Unix Copy In Copy Out) which automatically
contacts the remote system via a modem line or a @{"TCP-IP" Link "TCP-IP"} connection.
The remote system then starts its own @{b}uucico@{ub} and both programs process
their jobs and send the files forth and back.

   Even remote command execution is possible with UUCP. To achieve this
a job with three files is created. Two of them are data files with the
prefix @{b}D.@{ub}. One of these contains the data and the other the commands
how to process the data file on the remote system. The third file with
the prefix @{b}C.@{ub} contains the commands for @{b}uucico@{ub} to send both files to
the remote system.

   The command file is renamed to a file with the prefix @{b}X.@{ub} on the
remote system. After the connection has been closed @{b}uucico@{ub} starts the
command @{b}uuxqt@{ub} (Unix to Unix eXeCuTion?). It looks into the spool
directory for files with the prefix @{b}X.@{ub} and processes the commands.

   This mechanism can be also used to transfer mail and news messages
(The news distribution system USENET was originally based on UUCP). The
data file contains a message in the @{"RFC 822" Link "Message Formats"} format and the command file
contains mail and news processing commands, like @{b}rmail@{ub}.

   Only mail messages are transferred in this way nowadays, because
small files degrade the performance of the file transfer. This can be
avoided if the data file contains several messages (batching). News
messages can simply be concatenated into one file, because they already
contain the message length in the header. For mail messages an adaption
of the @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} format is used, called Batched SMTP (BSMTP).

   To reduce the amount of data which needs to be transferred batched
files are usually compressed. Currently in use are three compression
methods: compress, freeze and gzip. Normally only the plain output of
those programs is stored in the data file, but compressed news batches
usually contain a small text header which identifies the compression
method.

Domain name for your system
---------------------------

@{b}rfc.domainname@{ub}
     The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your system. The FQDN
     consists of the hostname plus the name of your domain. This
     variable is @{i}mandantory@{ui} for using UMS RFC.

     If your system doesn't have an own domain name then set
     @{"rfc.noownfqdn" Link "rfc.noownfqdn"} and use the domain name of your server host.

   Example:

     ( rfc.domainname "foobar.earth.sol.galaxy" )

Account name for a local UMS RFC user
-------------------------------------

@{b}rfc.username@{ub}
     This is the @{i}account@{ui} name for a user. This variable is @{i}mandantory@{ui}
     for every UMS user whose messages are exported with UMS RFC. The
     user entry also must contain an alias for this name.

   Example:

     ( rfc.domainname "foobar.earth.sol.galaxy" )
     
     ( User
       ( Name "Joe Dumb User" )
       ( Alias "jduser" )
       ...

Address conversions during message export
-----------------------------------------

@{b}rfc.export.*@{ub}
     This set of variables specificies the domain names used in the
     address conversion for exporting messages from non RFC compliant
     nets. Currently defined are the conversions for Fido (FTN) and
     Maus, using the following variables:

          rfc.export.fido  (Default: .fidonet.org)
          rfc.export.maus  (Default: .maus.de)

   Example:

     ( rfc.export.fido ".fido.de" )
     ( rfc.export.maus ".maus.sub.org" )

   The above example will result in the following address conversion:

     Joe User,1:2/3.4@fidonet  ->  Joe_User@p4.f3.n2.z1.fido.de
     Joe User,HB.maus          ->  Joe_User@HB.maus.sub.org

   Example:

     ( rfc.import.fido ".fido.de,.fidonet.org" )
     ( rfc.import.maus ".maus.sub.org" )

   The above example will result in the following address conversion:

     Joe_User@p4.f3.n2.z1.fidonet.org  ->  Joe User,1:2/3.4@fidonet
     Joe_User@p4.f3.n2.z1.fido.de      ->  Joe User,1:2/3.4@fidonet

Encoding of mail message texts during export
--------------------------------------------

@{b}rfc.mailencoding@{ub}
     When exporting mail messages which contain non-ASCII characters for
     transportation over non-transparent (that is 8 bit clean) links,
     UMS RFC can encode them according to the @{"MIME" Link "MIME"} standard. The
     following values are allowed for this variable:

          0  Don't encode (Default)
          1  Encode as @{b}quoted-printable@{ub}

     Note that even if you have disabled encoding the messages might be
     encoded as @{b}quoted-printable@{ub} if the transportation link isn't
     transparent.

   Example:

     ( rfc.mailencoding 1 )

The system has no own domain name
---------------------------------

@{b}rfc.noownfqdn@{ub}
     If your system has no own fully qualified domain name (FQDN), e.g.
     when you receive your mail with @{"POP3" Link "POP3"}, then you must set this
     variable to @{b}Y@{ub}.  UMS RFC then doesn't generate any @{b}Received:@{ub} lines
     nor does it add your systems' name to the @{b}Path:@{ub} line.

     In this case you must set @{"rfc.domainname" Link "rfc.domainname"} to the domain name of your
     server host.

   Example:

     ( rfc.noownfqdn Y )
     ( rfc.domainname "server.sub.domain" )

   The address will then look like:

     jduser@server.sub.domain


@EndNode

@Node "rfc.pathname" "umsrfc.guide/rfc.pathname"
@Next "nntpd.access"
@Prev "rfc.noownfqdn"
@Toc "UMS Configuration"

Path name for your system
-------------------------

@{b}rfc.pathname@{ub}
     The name of your system in the "Path:" line for news messages. If
     your system is a registered UUCP node, then this variable only
     needs to contain the hostname of your system. Otherwise it must
     contain the FQDN of your system.

     If you don't specify this variable then the contents of
     @{"rfc.domainname" Link "rfc.domainname"} are used.

   Example for registered UUCP nodes:

     ( rfc.domainname "foobar.earth.sol.galaxy" )
     ( rfc.pathname   "foobar" )


@EndNode

@Node "nntpd.access" "umsrfc.guide/nntpd.access"
@Next "nntpd.log"
@Prev "rfc.pathname"
@Toc "UMS Configuration"

Access rights for remote NNTP clients
-------------------------------------

@{b}nntpd.access@{ub}
     When a remote client tries to connect the @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} service the @{"umsnntpd" Link "umsnntpd"}
     server daemon reads the contents of this variable to find out
     which access rights the client has. The variable may contain
     multiple lines of the following format:

          <Name pattern> <UMS user name>,<Post Y/N>,<Server Y/N>

     The check is based on the domain name of the machine on which the
     client runs. The patterns from the first line down to the last
     line will be used to match the domain name. When a pattern matches
     then the access rights of this entry are used for the client. If
     no pattern matches the access is denied with an error message.

     The account of the specified UMS user name is used to export and
     import the news messages. If the second parameter is set to @{b}Y@{ub} then
     posting (that is importing) of news messages with the @{b}POST@{ub} command
     is allowed. If the third parameter is also set to @{b}Y@{ub} then the
     client is a @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} server and is allowed to use the @{b}IHAVE@{ub} command
     for transferring news messages.

   Example:

     ( nntpd.access
        "localhost       NNTP1,Y,Y\\n"
        "*.ping.de       NNTP2,Y,N\\n"
        "*               NNTP3,N,N\\n" )

   The above example allows full access for a client running on the
local machine. Clients running on machines in the domain @{b}ping.de@{ub} are
allowed to post news messages. All other machines are only allowed to
read news messages. Using three different UMS users you can control
which newsgroups are visible for each of the three categories using the
@{b}READACCESS@{ub} variable.

Group list for news message import
----------------------------------

@{b}nntpget.groups@{ub}
     The @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} importer @{"umsnntpget" Link "umsnntpget"} looks into this variable to find out
     which newsgroups it should request from the remote server. It may
     contain multiple lines. If you are using the option @{b}-g@{ub} each line
     must contain one newsgroup name. If you don't use this option then
     each line may contain multiple group name patterns seperated by
     commas and even negations.

   Example (use with option @{b}-g@{ub}):

     ( nntpget.groups "group.a\\n"
                      "group.b\\n"

    @{b}command@{ub}
          Command name for the @{b}C@{ub} line in the @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} command file. You
          have to talk to the administrator of your host which commands
          his software accepts and how it interprets them. The

          @{b}A..Z@{ub} or @{b}a..z@{ub}. It specifies the transfer priority for the job.
          @{b}0@{ub} has the highest priority and @{b}z@{ub} the lowest. The default is @{b}A@{ub}.

    @{b}batch@{ub}
          This optional parameter specifies if several mail message
          should be merged into one file (batching).

    @{b}compress command@{ub}
          Name of a command for the optional compression of the data
          files. Legal values are @{b}compress@{ub}, @{b}freeze@{ub} and @{b}gzip@{ub}. If you
          leave this field empty the data files won't be compressed.

    @{b}header@{ub}
          If this field is not empty, then the following header line
          will be created in the data file:

               #! <header text>

          Mail batches normally don't contain any headers, so you may
          leave this field empty.

    @{b}max size@{ub}
          Maximum size for one batch file. When it reaches this size it
          will be closed and a new batch file will be used. The default

    @{b}grade@{ub}
          Every @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} job has a grade which is one letter out of @{b}0..9@{ub},
          @{b}A..Z@{ub} or @{b}a..z@{ub}. It specifies the transfer priority for the job.
          @{b}0@{ub} has the highest priority and @{b}z@{ub} the lowest. The default is @{b}A@{ub}.

    @{b}batch@{ub}
          This optional parameter specifies if several news message
          should be merged into one file (batching). Usually
          non-batched news transfer is a bad idea.

    @{b}compress command@{ub}
          Name of a command for the optional compression of the data
          files. Legal values are @{b}compress@{ub}, @{b}freeze@{ub} and @{b}gzip@{ub}. If you
          leave this field empty the data files won't be compressed.

    @{b}header@{ub}
          If this field is not empty, then the following header line
          will be created in the data file:

               #! <header text>

          The following table shows some common header texts:

               Name     | Meaning
               ------------------------------------------------
               cunbatch | batched, compressed (compress) news
               funbatch | batched, compressed (freeze) news
               gunbatch | batched, compressed (gzip) news

          You should talk to the administrator of your host which
          headers and compression types are supported by the software
          of the host system.

    @{b}max size@{ub}
          Maximum size for one batch file. When it reaches this size it
          will be closed and a new batch file will be used. The default
          size is 65536 bytes.

   Example for batched, uncompressed news, no header, batch size 300000
Bytes:

     ( uucp.newsexport "rnews,A,Y,,,300000" )

   Example for batched, compressed news, with header (#! cunbatch),
batch size 65536 Bytes:

     ( uucp.newsexport "rnews,B,Y,compress,cunbatch" )

UUCP node name for your system
------------------------------

@{b}uucp.nodename@{ub}
@{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} node name for your system. This name should not be longer than 7
     characters.

   Example:

     ( uucp.nodename "foobar" )

UUCP envelope type
------------------

@{b}uucp.envelope@{ub}
     When exporting mail messages over @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} a so called "envelope"
     around the message is sometimes required, e.g. if your mail is
     sent unbatched via @{b}rmail@{ub}. The following values are allowed for
     this variable:

          0  Don't generate an envelope
          1  Generate a RFC 976 style UUCP envelope
          2  Generate a normal UUCP envelope        (Default)

     With a given address and date, a normal envelope looks like this:

          From <user>@<domain> <date>

     A RFC 976 envelope looks like this:

          From <user> <date> remote from <domain>

     Ask the administrator of your host what envelope type is expected
     by the software used on the host system.

   Example:

     ( uucp.envelope 1 )

Keep dupe messages
------------------

@{b}uucp.keepdupes@{ub}
     Normally duplicate messages are flagged as error and the  @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"}  job
     is not deleted. Sometimes dupes can't be avoided, because @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} is
     an offline protocol, that means there is no way to detect dupes on
     the sending hosts. On a system with several hosts and high traffic
     this can result in a high number of bad job files lying around,
     which do not contain real errors. If you set this variable to @{b}N@{ub}
     then bad jobs, which had only dupe errors, are automatically
     deleted.

   Example:

     ( uucp.keepdupes "N" )

Log dupe messages
-----------------

@{b}uucp.logdupes@{ub}
     Normally duplicate messages are also logged in the UMS RFC error
     log. If you don't want to bother with dupes then you should set
     this to @{b}N@{ub}.  See @{"uucp.keepdupes" Link "uucp.keepdupes"}, for more information.

   Example:

     ( uucp.logdupes "N" )

@Next "uucp.recipients"
@Prev "uucp.logdupes"
@Toc "UMS Configuration"

Mail routing configuration
--------------------------

@{b}uucp.mailroute@{ub}
     Sometimes it's important to specify static routes for outgoing
     mails.  Normally this variable is empty so NO routing information
     will be generated. Each line in this variable consists of an
     address pattern and a list of hosts:

          <address pattern> [<host1>[,<host2>....]]

     When the recipient address matches the address pattern and the
     host list is not empty, then the @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} exporter @{"ums2uucp" Link "ums2uucp"} will
     create an explicit mail route. The route information will be added
     AFTER the address conversion for non RFC compliant nets has been
     applied.

     If the variable does contain several lines, then the patterns will
     be tried from the first line down to the last line until one
     pattern matches. If no pattern matches, then no route information
     will be generated.

   Example:

     ( uucp.mailroute "#?.maus.de        host1\\n"
                      "#?.zer.sub.org    host2,host3\\n"
                      "#?.fidonet.org\\n"
                      "#?.de             host4\\n" )

   The following test cases:

     user@box.maus.de
     user@box.zer.sub.org
     user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org
     user@zauber.nase.de
     user@dummy.blubb.edu

   are translated to the following mail routes for non-batched mail
tranfer:

     C rmail host1!box.maus.de!user
     C rmail host2!host3!box.zer.sub.org!user
     C rmail user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org
     C rmail host4!zauber.nase.de!user
     C rmail user@dummy.blubb.edu

   and to the following mail routes for batched mail transfer:

     RCPT TO: <@host1:user@box.maus.de>
     RCPT TO: <@host2,@host3:user@box.zer.sub.org>
     RCPT TO: <user@f7.n242.z2.fidonet.org>
     RCPT TO: <@host4:user@zauber.nase.de>
     RCPT TO: <user@dummy.blubb.edu>

Limit number of recipients
--------------------------

@{b}uucp.recipients@{ub}
     Limits the number of recipients for one mail file. If there are
     more recipients then the @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} exporter @{"ums2uucp" Link "ums2uucp"} will create
     several mail files for one mail. The default is to put all
     recipients in one mail file.

   Example:

     ( uucp.recipients 2 )

   Using the above example on a mail with three recipients will result
in two separate mails to be send. If unbatched mail transfer is used
then the following two @{b}C@{ub} lines are generated in the command files:

     C rmail usera@test1.foo.bar,userb@test2.foo.bar
     C rmail userc@test3.foo.bar

   If batched  mail  transfer  is  used  then  the  following  commands
are generated in the batch file:

     MAIL FROM: <user@test.foo.bar>
     RCPT TO: <usera@test1.foo.bar>
     RCPT TO: <userb@test2.foo.bar>
     DATA

NNTP exporter
=============

   The command @{b}umsnntp@{ub} exports news messages via @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} to a remote host.

     Syntax:
     
             umsnntp  -h <remote host>
                     [-S <Service name or port number>]
     
                     [-p <UMS password>]
                     [-s <UMS message base>]
                     [-u <UMS user name>]
     
                     [-n <authentication name>]
                     [-i <authentication password>]
     
                     [-b <select bit>]
                     [-I]
     
                     [-c]
                     [-r <n>]
                     [-w <n>]
     
     Defaults:
     
                      -S  Service @{b}nntp@{ub} (port 119)
                      -p  No password
                      -s  Default message base
                      -u  User @{b}NNTP@{ub}
                      -n  jduser
                      -i  secret
                      -b  No select bit
                      -r  360
                      -w  60

   Explanation of the command line options:

@{b}-n@{ub}
     This name is send to the remote server if it requests user
     authentication. Note that the name is send in clear text!

@{b}-i@{ub}
     This string is send to the remote server if the user
     authentication also requires a password. Note that the password is
     send in clear text!

@{b}-b@{ub}
     Bit number of an additional select bit. Only messages with this
     bit set in the user flags will be exported. This can be used to
     run a special filter program before exporting with @{b}umsnntp@{ub}.

@{b}-I@{ub}
     Use the @{b}IHAVE@{ub} command to send the news messages to the remote
     host. If you don't specify this option, then the @{b}POST@{ub} command is
     used. Most @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} servers don't allow the @{b}IHAVE@{ub} command for clients,
     so you may not be able to use this option.

@{b}-c@{ub}
     Export news messages continously. After exporting all new messages
     @{b}umsnntp@{ub} will wait a short while and then will start to export all
     new messages which arrived in the meantime.

@{b}-r@{ub}
     Causes @{b}umsnntp@{ub} to rescan the whole message base for new messages
     after @{i}n@{ui} export runs. All messages which couldn't be sent until now
     will be sent again. This option is only useful in conjunction with
     @{b}-c@{ub}.

@{b}-w@{ub}
     Causes @{b}umsnntp@{ub} to wait @{i}n@{ui} seconds between two export runs.  This
     option is only useful inconjunction with @{b}-c@{ub}.

NNTP importer (server daemon)
=============================

   The command @{b}umsnntpd@{ub} is a server daemon which offers a transfer
service for news messages via @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} to remote clients. It can only be
executed by the Internet Super Daemon @{"Inetd" Link "Inetd"}.

     Syntax:
     
             umsnntpd [<UMS user name>]
                      [<UMS password>]
                      [<UMS message base>]
     
     Defaults:
     
                      User @{b}NNTPD@{ub}
                      No password

NNTP importer
=============

   The command @{b}umsnntpget@{ub} imports news messages via @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} from a remote
host.

     Syntax:
     
             umsnntpget  -h <remote host>
                        [-S <Service name or port number>]
     
                        [-p <UMS password>]
                        [-s <UMS message base>]
                        [-u <UMS user name>]
     
                        [-n <authentication name>]
                        [-i <authentication password>]
     
                        [-g]
                        [-P <n>]
                        [-c]
                        [-q]
     
     Defaults:
     
                         -S  Service @{b}nntp@{ub} (port 119)
                         -p  No password
                         -s  Default message base
                         -u  User @{b}NNTP@{ub}
                         -n  jduser
                         -i  secret
                         -P  1

   Explanation of the command line options:

@{b}-n@{ub}
     This name is send to the remote server if it requests user
     authentication. Note that the name is send in clear text!

@{b}-i@{ub}
     This string is send to the remote server if the user
     authentication also requires a password. Note that the password is
     send in clear text!

@{b}-g@{ub}
     Use the commands @{b}GROUP@{ub}, @{b}STAT@{ub} and @{b}NEXT@{ub} to scan for new news
     messages. This may lower the load on the remote @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} server but
     the transfer overhead may be significantely higher, especially if
     the server uses long expiration periods for news messages. If you
     don't specify this option the command @{b}NEWNEWS@{ub} is used which only
     transfers information about new messages (see @{"setnntpdate" Link "setnntpdate"}).

@{b}-P@{ub}
     Use @{i}n@{ui} (up to 20) parallel processes to transfer news messages. This
     is useful to make the transfer of news messages over a slow serial
     link more efficient by using most of the available bandwidth.

@{b}-c@{ub}
     Use parameters on the command line after the last valid command
     line option as input parameters. You may request news messages by
     message ID:

          umsnntpget -h nntphost -c 1234@dummy.do.main 6789@test.foo.bar

     or by group names:

          umsnntpget -h nntphost -c -g comp.sys.amiga.misc comp.sys.amiga.datacomm

@{b}-q@{ub}
     Don't print message ids.

Set date of the last NNTP access
================================

   The command @{b}setnntpdate@{ub} sets the date of the last @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} access for
@{"umsnntpget" Link "umsnntpget"}.

     Syntax:
     
             setnntpdate  <UMS user name>
                          <UMS password>
                         [<UMS message base>]
                         [DATE <date string>]
     
     Defaults:
     
                          Default message base

   Explanation of the command line options:

@{b}DATE@{ub}
     You have to specify the date as defined in RFC 822. @{b}setnntpdate@{ub}
     will transform it to the format which is needed for @{"umsnntpget" Link "umsnntpget"}. If
     you don't specify this option the last access date will be printed
     in RFC 822 format.

POP3 importer
=============

   The command @{b}umspop3@{ub} imports mail messages via @{"POP3" Link "POP3"} from a remote
host.

     Syntax:
     
             umspop3  -h <remote host>
                     [-S <Service name or port number>]

                      -i <mailbox password>
                     [-k]
     
                     [-c]
                     [-w <n>]
     
     Defaults:
     
                      -S  Service @{b}pop3@{ub} (port 110)
                      -p  No password
                      -s  Default message base
                      -u  User @{b}POP3@{ub}
                      -w  60

   Explanation of the command line options:

@{b}-n@{ub}
     Name of the mailbox on the remote host.

@{b}-i@{ub}
     Password for the mailbox on the remote host.

@{b}-k@{ub}
     If this option is used @{b}umspop3@{ub} won't delete the messages in the
     mailbox on the remote host. Note that these messages will show up
     as dupes next time you use @{b}umspop3@{ub}!

@{b}-c@{ub}
     Import mail messages continously. After importing all new messages
     @{b}umspop3@{ub} will wait a short while and then will start to import all
     new messages which arrived in the meantime.

@{b}-w@{ub}
     Causes @{b}umspop3@{ub} to wait @{i}n@{ui} seconds between two export runs.  This

SMTP exporter
=============

   The command @{b}umssmtp@{ub} exports mail messages via @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} to a remote host.

     Syntax:

                      -r  360
                      -w  60

   Explanation of the command line options:

@{b}-b@{ub}
     Bit number of an additional select bit. Only messages with this
     bit set in the user flags will be exported. This can be used to
     run a special filter program before exporting with @{b}umssmtp@{ub}.

@{b}-c@{ub}
     Export mail messages continously. After exporting all new messages
     @{b}umssmtp@{ub} will wait a short time and then will start to export all
     new messages which arrived in the meantime.

@{b}-r@{ub}
     Causes @{b}umssmtp@{ub} to rescan the whole message base for new messages
     after @{i}n@{ui} export runs. All messages which couldn't be sent until now
     will be sent again. This option is only useful in conjunction with
     @{b}-c@{ub}.

@{b}-w@{ub}
     Causes @{b}umssmtp@{ub} to wait @{i}n@{ui} seconds between two export runs.  This
     option is only useful inconjunction with @{b}-c@{ub}.

   See also @{"UMS options" Link "UMS options"} and @{"Protocol options" Link "Protocol options"}.

   When @{b}umssmtp@{ub} connects to a @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} server it tries to use @{"ESMTP" Link "SMTP"} first.
If this succeeds then @{b}umssmtp@{ub} controls its actions according to the
options offered by the server:

@{b}SIZE@{ub}
     It will tell the server how big the messages are before
     transferring them.

@{b}8BITMIME@{ub}
     It will tell the server which encoding type the message body has
     before transferring it.

@{b}PIPELINING@{ub}
     Commands and responses will be queued to improve performance.

                    -d  0

   Explanation of the command line options:

@{b}-p@{ub}
     Password for the UMS user. This will be used for @{i}ALL@{ui} logins.

@{b}-d@{ub}
     UUCP log level: 0, 1, 2 or 3.

@{b}subdirectory@{ub}
     Name of the subdirectory in the @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} spool directory. This
     parameter is supplied by @{b}uucico@{ub} when a hierarchical spool
     directory structure is used.

   @{b}uuxqt@{ub} uses the following system for the @{"UMS user names" Link "Users"}:

Print UMS messages as RFC messages
==================================

   The command @{b}umsrfcprint@{ub} prints @{"UMS" Link "UMS"} messages as @{"RFC" Link "RFC"} messages to the
standard output. You can use the output redirection (@{b}>file@{ub}) to write
messages into a file. The printed messages will @{i}not@{ui} be marked as read.
This tool is very helpful when you want to know how the exported message
will look like.

     Syntax:
     
             umsrfcprint  <UMS user name>
                          <UMS password>
                         [<UMS message base>]
                          MSGNUM <n>
                         [DOTS]
     
     Defaults:
     
                          Default message base
                          Don't encode lines beginning with a dot

   Explanation of the command line options:

@{b}MSGNUM@{ub}
     Specifies which @{"UMS" Link "UMS"} message should be printed.

@{b}DOTS@{ub}
     Some protocols like @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"}, @{"POP3" Link "POP3"} and @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} require a special encoding
     of lines beginning with a "." (dot). With this option you can
     enable this encoding.

Import RFC messages as UMS messages
===================================

   The command @{b}umsrfcwrite@{ub} reads @{"RFC" Link "RFC"} messages and imports them as @{"UMS" Link "UMS"}
messages. You can use the input redirection (@{b}<file@{ub}) or the @{b}FILE@{ub}
parameter to read messages from a file. This tool is very helpful when
you want to import messages from other RFC tools.

     Syntax:
     
             umsrfcwrite  <UMS user name>
                          <UMS password>
                         [<UMS message base>]

                          Read message from standard input
                          Don't decode lines beginning with a dot
                          Import news message

   Explanation of the command line options:

@{b}FILE@{ub}
     Specifies from which file the @{"RFC" Link "RFC"} message should be read instead
     from the standard input.

@{b}DOTS@{ub}
     Some protocols like @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"}, @{"POP3" Link "POP3"} and @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} require a special decoding
     of lines beginning with a "." (dot). With this option you can
     enable this decoding. Note that the last line containing only a
     single dot must have been removed already!

   If you don't specify any recipient addresses then the message will
be imported as news message. If you specify one or more addresses the
message will imported as mail message with the addresses as recipients.

   Note that @{b}umsrfcwrite@{ub} does @{i}not@{ui} transform the @{b}CR-LF@{ub} combination to
@{b}LF@{ub}. Thus you have to perform this transformation yourself before
importing the message with this tool!

access to your system. The file @{b}AMITCP:db/inet.access@{ub} contains the
rules which services may be used on your system. The following two lines
allow the access to the services @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} and @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} from any host on the
Internet:

     smtp    *   allow   LOG
     nntp    *   allow   LOG

Configuration for the Internet Super Daemon
===========================================

   The daemons for the @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"}, @{"POP3" Link "POP3"} and @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} services are started
automatically when a remote host accesses those services. Add the
following three lines to the @{b}inetd@{ub} configuration file
@{b}AMITCP:db/inetd.conf@{ub}:

     smtp    stream  tcp nowait root UMS:Bin/umssmtpd umssmtpd
     pop3    stream  tcp nowait root UMS:Bin/umspop3d umspop3d

Services configuration
======================

   To use the services @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"}, @{"POP3" Link "POP3"} and @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} the file @{b}AMITCP:db/services@{ub}
must contain the following lines:

     smtp    25/tcp

UUCP directories
================

@{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} needs three directories for its work:

@{b}Spool directory@{ub}
     Directory for command, data and log files. You should assign
     @{b}UUSPOOL:@{ub} to this directory. Each remote site has its own
     subdirectory. In each subdirectory there should be a directory
     @{b}bad-jobs@{ub} for errorneous jobs. Example with two remote systems
     named @{b}dummy@{ub} and @{b}test@{ub}:

          1> Dir UUSPOOL: all
               dummy (dir)
                    bad-jobs (dir)
               test (dir)
                    bad-jobs (dir)
            logfile                          TimeLog
            XferStat

@{b}Configuration directory@{ub}
     UUCP configuration file reside here. You should assign @{b}UULIB:@{ub} to
     this directory.

          1> Dir UULIB:
            config                           L.Ports
            L.Sys                            security
            seq

@{b}Public directory@{ub}
     Download and upload area for UUCP. You should assign @{b}UUPUB:@{ub} to this
     directory.

Main UUCP configuration
=======================

   The file @{b}UULIB:config@{ub} contains the @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} configuration. A minimal
configuration only needs your node name, a dummy user name and a
setting for the debug level:

     NodeName    foobar
     UserName    root
     Debug       0

UUCP ports description
======================

   The file @{b}UULIB:L.Ports@{ub} describes the devices which @{b}uucico@{ub} uses to
contact remote systems. Normally this is a serial port with a modem, so
the file should look like this:

     acu=ser device=serial.device unit=0

   If you want to use @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} over @{"TCP-IP" Link "TCP-IP"} you must add another device to
this file:

     acu=tcp device=telser.device unit=0


@EndNode

@Node "L.Sys" "umsrfc.guide/L.Sys"
@Next "UUCPPoll"
@Prev "L.Ports"

Remote UUCP Systems
===================

   The file @{b}UULIB:L.Sys@{ub} describes how @{b}uucico@{ub} can contact remote
systems. This includes the device to use, the serial line speed, the
phone number and the login script:

     dummy    Any   ser   19200    ATDP123456  ogin: foobar ssword: hello

   To contact a remote system with @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} over @{"TCP-IP" Link "TCP-IP"} you replace the
phone number with the hostname of the remote system. So the line should
look like this:

     dummy    Any   tcp   19200    dummy    ogin: foobar ssword: hello

UUCP poll script
================

   The following script first exports all messages to the remote system
and then contacts it. You can specify the name of the remote system as
parameter:

     .KEY SYSTEM
     .DEF SYSTEM dummy
     .BRA {
     .KET }
     
     ums2uucp -h {SYSTEM}
     uucico -s{SYSTEM}

@Node "Telser" "umsrfc.guide/Telser"
@Next "Hosts"
@Prev "UUCPPoll"
@Toc "Examples"

Telser configuration
====================

   The file @{b}AMITCP:db/telser.conf@{ub} describes the configuration for every
unit of the @{b}telser.device@{ub}. For the unit 0 it should look like this:

     0  ""    NoOperation NOOPENWIN NOLINGER NODEBUG T:telser.log


@EndNode

@Node "Hosts" "umsrfc.guide/Hosts"
@Prev "Telser"
@Toc "Examples"

Host descriptions
=================

   The file @{b}AMITCP:db/telser.hosts@{ub} contains the descriptions of the
remote systems. If you @{i}dial@{ui} a remote system using the @{b}telser.device@{ub} it
looks into this file to find out the hostname and the parameters. For
our example system it looks like this:

     dummy    dummy.do.main  540   ""    00000000001

   Please make sure that the 11th bit is set, because it activates the
transparent mode of @{b}telser.device@{ub} which is a @{i}must@{ui} for @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} over @{"TCP-IP" Link "TCP-IP"}.

History of UMS RFC
******************

   The following list gives an overview of all the changes since the
first version of UMS RFC: For more detailed information read the file
@{b}UMS/Networks/RFC/src/History@{ub}.

@{i}1.0 (20-Feb-1999)@{ui}
        - New version scheme taken into use. Changes in the library
          interface should be less error-prone now.

        - Now all LFs are converted to CR-LF as required by the @{"RFC 822" Link "Message Formats"}
          format, except for unbatched UUCP mail messages or UUCP news
          messages. All tools convert CR-LF to LF before importing the
          messages.

        - @{"ESMTP" Link "SMTP"} extensions PIPELINING and 8BITMIME implemented.

        - @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} extensions @{b}XOVER@{ub} and @{b}LIST OVERVIEW.FMT@{ub} implemented in

        - Implemented some support for TaylorUUCP in The @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"} tools.

        - Added new tool @{"umsrfcwrite" Link "umsrfcwrite"} for importing RFC messages.

        - The variable @{b}uucp.dumbhost@{ub} has been replace with the variable
          @{"uucp.envelope" Link "uucp.envelope"}. This might require a change to your UMS
          configuration.

        - The variables @{b}uucp.debug@{ub}, @{b}uucp.debugfile@{ub} and @{b}uucp.filtercr@{ub}
          have been removed.

        - @{"RFC" Link "RFC"} times is now converted to local time.

        - Several bug fixes.

        - Library interface changed. Please make sure that you only use
          the programs and library of this version together.

        - Support for systems without own domain name added, see
          @{"rfc.noownfqdn" Link "rfc.noownfqdn"}.  The variable @{b}rfc.receivedname@{ub} has been
          removed.

        - The variable @{"rfc.pathname" Link "rfc.pathname"} is now optional.

        - Support for @{"ESMTP" Link "SMTP"} added. Currently implemented is the SIZE
          extension.

        - Added new tool @{"umsrfcprint" Link "umsrfcprint"} for printing RFC messages.

        - @{"POP3" Link "POP3"} server daemon @{"umspop3d" Link "umspop3d"}.

        - Support for UMS' binary field.

        - Implemented UUCP grades. The format of the variables
          @{"uucp.mailexport" Link "uucp.mailexport"} and @{"uucp.newsexport" Link "uucp.newsexport"} was changed!

        - Implemented CTRL-C handling for @{"umsnntpget" Link "umsnntpget"}.

        - Command logging for @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"} and @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"} server daemons.

        - Switch for Daylight Saving Time.

        - Several bug fixes and new command switches.

@{i}0.10 (04-Jun-1995)@{ui}
        - First official release of the UMS RFC package the successor
          of the UMS UUCP package.

        - All RFC from/to UMS conversions are handled by the
          @{b}umsrfc.library@{ub} now.

        - Support for @{"NNTP" Link "NNTP"}, @{"POP3" Link "POP3"}, @{"SMTP" Link "SMTP"}, @{"UUCP" Link "UUCP"}.

        - New documentation.
