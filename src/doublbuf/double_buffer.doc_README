Here's some simple double buffering example code, using OS 3.0 routines.
It is quite fast - the actual switch between different bitplanes takes
almost no time.

Compiler used: SAS/C 6.55.

I have a GST file which contains every header file known, hence I barely
made any #include <...> statements in the source codes.
