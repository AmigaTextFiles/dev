This directory contains some Reaction examples that are
ready to compile on OS4. They have been compiled with
gcc 3.4.4 and tested on OS4 pre3.

The layout of the source code in each of the examples have
followed the same layout as the Reaction example in the SDK.
This should make it a relativity easy task to copy and paste
the objects, and their IDs, into the supplied template to
create a working GUI (hopefully).

The examples are public domain.
