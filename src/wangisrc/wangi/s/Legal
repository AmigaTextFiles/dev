 I hereby reject any liability or responsibility for these or any
 other consequences from the use of />VAR PROGRAM LOCAL<\ whatsoever. This includes,
 but is not limited to, damage to your equipment, to your data,
 personal injuries, financial loss or any other kinds of side effects.
 Although />VAR PROGRAM LOCAL<\ has been tested thoroughly on several different
 machines, I cannot rule out the possibility that />VAR PROGRAM LOCAL<\:

     1. is somehow incompatible to your equipment
     
     2. has bugs that show up on your equipment
     
     3. does not do what it is supposed to do on your equipment
     
     4. May damage you equipment

 It is your responsibility to take any precautions necessary to
 protect yourself from these or any other effects. I explicitly
 reject any liability or responsibility from the consequences of you
 using />VAR PROGRAM LOCAL<\

 Distribution
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 />VAR PROGRAM LOCAL<\ may be freely distributed and copied, as long as the following 
 conditions are fulfilled:

     1. All parts of the program and the documentation must be complete.
        The distribution of single parts or incomplete subsets of the
        original distribution is forbidden.
        
     2. If />VAR PROGRAM LOCAL<\ is to be included in a commercial distribution (including
        magazines!) then I must be sent a copy of the product (or if it is a 
        mag that I am subscribed to then an increase in subscription). It 
        would be better if you contacted me beforehand to ensure you have the 
        latest version. In any case full credit must be given within the
        magazine (ie mention my name).
     
     3. If the included source code is used in another program then credit 
        must be given in the documentation.

 Note To Magazines
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 In the past I have had some of my programs included on magazine coverdisks
 without my permission when in the documentation it was stated that this
 was required... I want my programs on coverdisks but you _MUST_ read and
 fufil the "Distribution" section above. If you disagree then contact me
 or write a message in the AMIGA_MAGS echo...
