 Startup-Menu is a menu which appears on start-up giving the user a choice 
of which startup-sequence to follow/command to run. 
    
    - The menu can have any number of gadgets, limited only by the 
      screenmode used and hardware, I've had 800+!
    - Can Display some [comic] phrases while it is running.
    - Rexx. Can send user specified ARexx commands on startup, exit and when
      a gadget is pressed.
    - Opens on a user specified screenmode, with a user specified palette. 
    - Can disable click of all floppy drives and various other system options.
    - Can pop up only if a certain qualifier is depressed.
    - Shows System time and free memory.
    - The menu can stay active after a command has been launched or it can
      quit.
    - A file can be displayed on the menu background, be it a picture, text 
      or sound (even animations, movies and songs with WB 3.1). Requires 
      WB 3.
    - ... more, more, more

@node INSTALL "Installation"
        
 The included C= Install script should be used to install SM. This script
will copy :

     the main program to C:
     the preference editor to SYS:Prefs/ 
     @{" Reqtools.library " link REQTOOLS} to LIBS: 
     some example scripts to S:
     some example ARexx scripts to S:
     a example prefs file to S: 
     a @{" new startup-sequence " link NEWSTART} to S:

These files will be copied only after confirmation. 

 This installation renames your old startup-sequence to "Startup-sequence.SMOLD"
only after confirmation. OK everyone panic, startup-sequence, alert, ALERT.
A lot of people preach that the startup-sequence should not be touched and 
that the user-startup should be used instead - fine if you only want one 
environment. However SM requires a custom startup-sequence so that it can 
control which script is executed and ultimately which startup-sequence is 
followed. Things are not all bad though, as one of SM options you can put your
old startup-sequence in, it is all calm again. If you have any major hassles 
about altering your startup-sequence or are not competent with the Amiga then
please do not install Startup-menu...
      
... Why not install SM, try it out and then use the remove script if you are
unhappy?

@node NEWSTART "Your clean new startup-sequence"
The startup-sequence installed depends on your WB version.
The new startup-sequence for WB3-> is :

;*********** start

The new startup-sequence for WB2/2.1 is :

;*********** start
/>Insert s/Startup-sequence_os2<\

@node USEPREFS "Getting it together"

 SM requires a preference file in order to work. This file is created by 
SMPrefs. With SMPrefs you create a list of gadgets that will be 
present on the menu at startup. The main window contains the following 
gadgets:

A @{" listview " link GAD} showing all current menu buttons. Double clicking 
this allows the options of a button to be altered.

List manipulation gadgets:

 @{" Top    " link TOP   }
 @{" Up     " link UP    }
 @{" Down   " link DOWNG }
 @{" Bottom " link BOTTOM} 
 @{" Sort   " link SORT  }
 @{" New    " link NEW   } 
 @{" Remove " link REMOVE} 
 @{" Copy   " link COPY  }  

The listview to the right of the window lets you select which group of
settings you wish to alter. Double clicking on the desired option will 
allow you to change the settings. A new window will normally be brought 
up. The current groups of settings are:
  
 @{" Screen & Window " link BACKDROP}
 @{" ScreenMode      " link SCREEN  }
 @{" Font            " link FONT    }
 @{" Scroll Font     " link SFONT   }
 @{" Palette         " link PALETTE }
 @{" Titles          " link TITLES  }
 @{" ARexx           " link AREXXP  }
 @{" System Setings  " link SYS     }
 @{" Qualifiers      " link QUAL    }
 
Preference file gadgets:

 @{" Save   " link SAVE}
 @{" Cancel " link CANCEL}
         
The editor also has the following menus :

 Project
 @{" Open...    |Æ| O " link OPEN}
 @{" Save as... |Æ| A " link SAVEAS}
 @{" Test             " link TEST}
 @{" ================ " link HA_THIS_IS_A_SEPERATOR!!}

@node SYS "System options"
brings up a window from which the following may be toggled from:
  
 No drive click : Disables drive click if checked
 
 WildStar : Allows the use of * as a synomyn for #? in pattern matching.
 
 Shanghai windows : All windows that don't specify a screen to open on are
 opened on the default public screen and not the workbench screen (NOTE 
 that workbench is the default public screen by default).
  
 Screen to front : When a new window is open the screen it is opening on is 
 brought to the front if checked.
 
 Flush memory : If selected then the menory will be flushed after the menu 
 quits. This can free memory that is used for fonts and other resident files.
 
 LogFile : If selected then all commands run via SM will be logged in the
 file S:SM_LOG. The date and time they were launched along with the command
 name will be recorded.
@endnode 
@remark *********************************************************************
@node BACKDROP "Screen Type"

 If the checkbox marked "Phrases" is ticked then @{" phrases " ling USAGE} will be scrolled 
along the foot of the menu.

 The "Across" gadget specifies how many buttons wide the menu will be, the
corresponding height is shown in the "Down" gadget.

 The "Wait" gedget specifies the amount of time (seconds) that the menu 
will wait until quiting. This can be used to execute a default 
Startup-sequence after a period of time, eg in your ss:

Failat 21
C:Startup-Menu
IF WARN
 execute >NIL: S:Startup-sequence.SMOLD  ; default SS
ENDIF

NB:
The time is only recorded when the menu window is active. A value of 0 
disables this function.

 The "Screen" cycle gadget lets you choose the basic layout of the screen.
The following are possible:

 RAM + Time : Free RAM and the current time is shown on the menu.
 
 Backdrop Window : The menu is one of Intuition's special backdrop windows.
 
 Normal : Eh, kinda normal, bog-standard old SM look.
 
 Display File : A file will be shown behind the menu. the file to be 
 displayed is shown in the "File" gadget, you can use "^" to get a file
 requester. When "Ok" is selected this file  will be loaded and if the 
 Screen, width height or number of colours it requires are different than 
 the current preferences then the preferences will be changed to match 
 those of the file.  The "Play Immediately" and "Repeat Playing" gadgets 
 specify if the object will start to play immediately if if the playing is 
 to loop. These options require V40 (3.1) of Workbench.

@node FLUSHM "Flush Memory"
 If selected startup-menu flushes the memory to free memory that may have
been used by fonts and libraries.
@endnode 
@remark *********************************************************************
@node QUAL "Qualifiers"
 Brings up a window which contains a number of checkmark gadgets. Each gadget
represents a key/qualifier on the Amiga keyboard or mouse. The menu will only 
appear if the selected qualifiers are active when Startup-menu is launched.
If they are not present then SM will quit with return code 10, this can make
a default startup-sequence be used unless the qualifier is active, eg:

Failat 21
C:Startup-Menu
IF WARN
 execute >NIL: S:Startup-sequence.SMOLD  ; default SS
ENDIF

If the "Applicability" is set to "All" then every selected qualifier must
be pressed. However if it is set to "One" then only one (or more) must be
pressed.

 @{" OK                 " link OK      }
 @{" Cancel             " link GADCAN  }
 
 With these gadgets/options it is possible to to have a number of different 
types of button on the menu:

 1. COMMAND BUTTON. Launches the command in the @{"Command" link CMD} gadget, and can 
optionally send an ARexx command (@{"ARexx Command" link REXCMD} gadget) to the port 
in the @{"ARexx Port" link GREXPRT} gadget. Can also create a new Shell (using @{"New Shell" link NEWSHELL} 
and @{"From" link FROM} gadgets).

 2. AREXX BUTTON. Sends an ARexx command, specified in the @{"ARexx Command" link REXCMD}
gadget, to the port of a program whose Arexx port name is specified in the
@{"ARexx Port" link GREXPRT} gadget. Can also create a new Shell (using @{"New Shell" link NEWSHELL} 
and @{"From" link FROM} gadgets). @{"Directory" link DIR} and @{"Command" link CMD} should be left empty.

 3. NEWSHELL BUTTON. Creates a new Shell. The file specified in the @{"From" link FROM} 
gadget is used as the FROM file for the Shell. Can optionally send an ARexx 
command (@{"ARexx Command" link REXCMD} gadget) to the port in the @{"ARexx Port" link GREXPRT} gadget.
@{"Directory" link DIR} and @{"Command" link CMD} should be left empty. 

 4. COMMENT BUTTON. Used as a comment on the created menu. A recessed bevel-
box is created rather than a gadget. The @{"Command" link CMD} gadget should contain
'Comment'.

NB: Pressing the close gadget on any of the windows is equivelent to 
selecting Cancel.

@remark *********************************************************************
@node USAGE "Usage"
 Once the program is installed and SMPrefs has been used to build up a 
@{" preference file " link USEPREFS} the menu will appear every time the 
computer is rebooted.

 Startup-Menu has a number of additional options which cannot be altered
from SMPrefs. These are entered as @{" program arguments " link ARGS} and are
normally not required.

@{u}ARexx@{uu}
~~~~~
 The program can send an ARexx command on four occasions, startup, exit, 
just before a command and when a command is selected. By default all these 
commands are sent to the port 'PLAY', the ARexx port of @{"Upd" link THANKS 13}, a 
sample player. The default commands are :

  on startup       :   id SM_INIT
  precommand       :   id SM_PRECMD
  on choice        :   id SM_CHOICE
  on exit          :   id SM_EXIT

 Three of these are globally defined in the preference while while the choice
command is set for each buton on the menu.

If you are going to use Upd then these ids should be defined in the file 
@{" S:Upd.ids " SYSTEM "Run >NIL: ED S:Upd.ids"} to relevent samples.

 If you wish to run an ARexx script then use REXX as the portname and the
path and name of the script as the command. Two example scripts should be included
in the distribution. One script is a initilisation script and the other is an
exit script. They allow a OctaMED module to be played while the menu is active.
See the scripts for more information.
 
NB:
 RexxMast must be active for ARexx commands to operate.

@{u}Public Screen@{uu}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  Startup-Menu opens a public screen. Its name is "SUPMENU" (without ").
This screen is valid before the initial ARexx command and after the final 
ARexx command, so it may be used by programs (causing the workbench 
screen not to be opened).

@{u}Phrases@{uu}
~~~~~~~
 The program scrolls a selection of comments along the bottom of the menu.
These comments are picked randomly from a selected file. All files that
match the wildcard S:SM/#?.WIT can be chosen from. Therefore to add your own 
phrases you can 
      - add it to the end of the existing phrases 
        (@{" SM_1.WIT " SYSTEM "Run >NIL: ED S:SM/SM_1.WIT"}, @{" SM_2.WIT " SYSTEM "Run >NIL: ED S:SM/SM_2.WIT"} and @{" Smiley.WIT " SYSTEM "Run >NIL: ED S:SM/Smiley.WIT"})
      - create a new file which contains the new phrases and is stored in 
        S:SM/ and has an extension of .WIT
 Smiley.WIT contains over 765 smileys and descriptions for each.
 The phrase files may have comments in them, these are marked by  ";" or
"##" at the start of line. For example:

; This is a comment
## This is another
#-) this is not a comment

NB:
 Only a max. of 10 .WIT files are used.

  Darren Salt      : for the phrases (SM_1.WIT and SM_2.WIT), these were 
   taken from an application on the coverdisk of @{" Acorn User " link ACORN} , RISCOS

  Asher Feldman : I took the idea of having the menu only pop if a
   certain qualifier was depressed from his program Slect (Slect is 
   similar to SM, but has a _lot_ less features and is not as flexable
   ... and also SM is not a copy of Slect, I only came across Slect
   in August 94 (on the AUI superdisk [DQua and NewEXT which are 
   written by me were also on the disk :-) ])

@{u}Revision History@{uu}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
(+ denotes a new feature or change, - a bug fix... loosely)
  
  1.00  : 5.2.94
    + first public release
    + uses ASL/Reqtools requesters
    + Font sensitive
    + SMPrefs opens on frontmost public screen
    + Works!
    + Memory loss of 1216 bytes by SMPrefs - help!

  1.1   : 6.4.94
    - Fixed memory loss of 1216, forgot to free an AslRequest.
    - Alas another memory hole - 520 lost in Startup-Menu.
    + Split command into directory and command.
    + Added ARexx support.
    + Added phrases scrolling along the menu foot.
    - Cleaned up the GUI.
    + Can now specify size of screen.
    + Removed display of current font on main window.
    - Fixed fatal bug with memory allocation, Remember structure 
      was not allocated, it could be overwritten.
    + Now uses rtLockWindow() instead of custom function
    + Test... added
    + The gadget attribute gadgets (key, gadget text etc.) are 
      now on a separate window which is accessed by double 
      clicking on an item on the listview.
    + Window now has zoom gadget, does not flip.
    + Changed info requester, does not contain graphic now and 
      is now a Reqtools requester.
    + After using the command requester another now pops up ask 
      if you wish to prefix the command.
    + Removed the front public screen crap, SMPrefs now opens 
      on the default public screen.
    + Install script does not use GetOption anymore, uses 
      standard ask.
    + Source now in archive form.
    + Documentation now in Amigaguide format.

  1.11   : 21.4.94
    - Fixed problem of more than one program loading when a key 
      is depressed continually one the menu.
    - Fixed newly discovered problem with AllocRemember(). I was
      allocating memory for the key itself first rather than 
      setting it to NIL.
    - Memory loss of 520 still present.

  1.12   : 04.05.94
    + When new selected in preference editor the edit window is 
      automatically brought up.
    + Documentation improved, links to commands eg prefs editor.

  1.2  : 09.05.94
    + New options
      1. send no ARexx commands.
      2. display no scrolling text.

  1.3    : 12.05.94
    + SystemTagList() now used to launch command.
    + New Synch gadget to determine if program is launched 
      synchronously or asynchronously. Equivalent to run'ing the 
      command.
    + Can now specify commands stack size on launch.
    + Priority can now be specified for each command.

  1.4   : 17.05.94
    + SMPrefs now has menus. As a result the gadgets 
      'Save as...', '?' and 'Open...' have been removed.
    + 'New' menu item added. Clears current list. When 'Load...' 
      is selected with a non-valid filename the program now does 
      a DisplayBeep() rather than clearing the listview.
    - List fixed. The names were not being updated correctly after
      editing them.
    + 'Input/Output' added, can now specify where the output from
      a command goes. Defaults to an AUTOCON.
    + SMPrefs window now opens just below the menu bar and 0 left.
    - Close gadget removed from window.
    + On error a message is now displayed via an AUTOCON rather
      than a requester.
    + A command of 'none' once again creates a comment. 
      Broke somewhere.
    + Startup-menu can now turn off floppy drive clicking on 
      startup, 'No click' check box used to specify if this 
      is wished.
    - Removed requester which poped up afer using 'cmd...'. Was
      redundant now because of 'ASynch'.

  1.5    : 18.06.94
    - All memory holes blocked!! -- most loss was from 
      incorrect usage of AllocRemember()... I was passing a 
      pointer to a pointer to a pointer??
    - Few Enforcer hits removed (programs now clean to my 
      knowlage).
    + Many more system options can now be altered at startup 
      (WILDSTAR,POPPUBSCREEN, SHANGHAI) so a new window has 
      been added to the prefs editor to hold these options 
      in addition to the no drive click option.
    + Backdrop option added.
    - Startup-menu now fails if prefs file contains no gadgets.
    - Really cleaned up code... as a result program size has 
      decreased.
    + ReadArgs() now used by SM to read in options from command 
      line.
    + Screen opened now public (SUPMENU).
    +/- Lots more I have forgotten. 

  1.5b   : 23.06.94
    > Support file only change.
    - Changed docs so that pubscreen feature is now documented
    + Added smiley.WIT
    + Added my setup (My_S.LHA).

  1.5c   : 30.06.94
    > Support file only change
    - Altered install script. It was installing the OS2 sequence 
      on OS3 machines and vice-versa.
    - Altered documentation.

  1.5d   : 14.07.94
    > Support file only change
    + Install script now uses CBM installer.
    + Removal script added, SM can now be tested.

  1.6    : 22.07.94
    + Shareware now.
    + .WIT files can now have comments (; or ##)
    - removed unneeded cd in .WIT handling.
    + .WIT handling much faster (over 800%!). Before the entire 
      .WIT file was copyed into memory and then phrases were 
      picked from it, now only the selected phrases are readin 
      using OS functions.

  1.7    : 23.07.94
    + Now shows Time and free memory

  1.8    : 24.07.94
    - Removed bug when then menu launches a program that does not 
      Asynch set in its config. The I/O file handles were not 
      being close and as a result memory was being lost.
    - Removed bug when the Time/RAM display was being munged 
      as a result of not being totally erased before being 
      rewritten.

  1.9  : 28.07.94
    - The menu occasionally vegged with just the screen 
      opened when launched. This was due to a partially 
      uninitialised tag list being passed to OpenWindow(). Fixed.

  1.10  -|
         |
  1.11  -|- Skipped due to wrong version numbering earlier :-o
         |
  1.12  -| 

  1.13  : 01.08.94
    + Added the ability to select the scrolling text font.

  1.14  : 08.08.94
    + Added NewShell after command launch plus FROM to specify
      the from file.
    + Added option to allow the menu not to quit after a 
      selection.
    + Qualifiers are now selected from the preference editor.
    + Added Wait option. If after Wait seconds a selection has 
      not been made then then menu will quit. Suggestion from
      Deitrich Scheurer.
    - Reworked GUI, on 200 line NTSC screens the bottom was being 
      cut off.

  1.15  : 09.08.94
    - Added to documentation to reflect better on the types of
      buttons available on the menu.
    - 'Comment' is now used to specify a comment rather than 
      'None'.
    - If "Command" is empty no command is launched.

  1.16  : 11.08.94
    + TEST argument removed and is now part of the prefs file.
    + NOFLUSH argument removed, now specified by "Flush" gadget
      on the GUI.
    + NOQUAL argument added. Forces the menu to open even if
      the qualifiers are not present.
    - If you were removing a key-shortcut from a button so that
      it would have no shortcut the prefs file was being saved
      unchanged. Fixed this.
    - Adjusted sizing of requester gadgets. 

  1.17  : 11.08.94
    - Was saving in test mode. Fixed.

  1.18  : 12.08.94
    - Time out is now stopped after a gadget is pressed, even
      if it returns to the menu.
    + Backbrop checkmark gadget removed, A cycle gadget replaces
      it to make options clearer. 

  1.19  : 14.08.94
    - Changed SMPrefs window title to "Startup-Menu preferences"

    - Cleaned up the gadget window.
    - Changed the size of the checkmark gadgets so that they are
      allways square.

  1.21  : 28.08.94
    - Removed duplicate sections of code in Startup-Menu,
      thus making it smaller in size.
    + In Test mode when a gadget is selected if it is set not
      to quit then the menu will not quit.

  1.22  : 29.08.94
    - Time display on the menu now has leading zeros when the
      seconds/minutes are less than 10... Happy Jon?

    + Added the "Normal" choice in the "Screen" gadget

  1.23  : 30.08.94
    - Preference file now saved/loaded using OS functions (
      FPuts & FGets). As a result it is much faster and also
      eliminates a bug (sometimes the menu would fail with 
      run-time error -1 when loading a preference file, this was
      no error of mine). 

  1.24  : 01.09.94
    + Added Datatype object on background.

  1.25  : 01.09.94
    + If WB 2.1 or higher is present then the ASL screenmode
      requester is now used rather than the Reqtools one for
      the "Screen..." requester.

  1.26  : 03.09.94
    + Added the "Play Immediately" and "Repeat Playing" gadgets
      to the "Display File" window. These specify if the object

      repeat. These options require V40 (3.1) of the OS.

      "New") and "Restore".
    - "Flush" gadget was not being updated on loading of pref
      files -- fixed.

      defaults"/"New" menu item -- Fixed.

      selection due to improper initialisation of the 
      menus screen/window titles -- Fixed.
    - "Shanghai" and "PopPubScreen" options now default to true
      as they should.

  1.34  : 29.09.94
    + GUI of SMPrefs given a facelift. It now looks "cleaner".
      The army of buttons that were on the right of the window
      have been replaced by a cycle gadget and a single button
      to alter the setting as selected by the cycle gadget.
      Bevel boxes have been removed.

      options"; "Across", "Down", "Wait" and "Screen Type" go 
      to "Screen & Window"

      its settings. As a result the "Alter..." button has been
      removed.

  1.36  : 02.10.94
    + Yep, yet more GUI cleanup. The second level windows were
      cleaned up, gadget placement reworked and a small "^"
      gadget added in place on the "Command..." and "Alter..." 
      gadgets.

  1.37  : 02.10.94
    + Added "Applicability" to qualifiers. This gives the option
      of the qualifiers working as they did before 1.28 (Tom

O, would, or I had seen the day
