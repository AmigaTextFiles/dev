@node INTRO "Introduction"
  So what the hell is Shrub you ask? A database of all available plants in 
the UK - No. A nifty program that helps you maintain the temperatures that
plant seeds need to germinate - I don't think so. Shrub creates directory
listings in a "tree" format.

  If you have used the "Tree" command of MSDOS then you'll know what I'm on
about. Otherwise here goes an explanation : You select a drawer, every file
within this drawer is displayed in a list, if there are other drawers in this
directory then they too will have their contents displayed, and so on. The
output in the list is formated so that it is easy to understand. Eg:

  File1
  File2
  Dir1
    File1.1
    Dir1.1
      File1.1.1
    File1.2
  File3
  File4

Note the indentation makes the listing readable, therefore helping you around
your drawers.

@node FEATURES "Features"
  There are a number of other directory tree viewers kicking around the 
Amiga PD scene. DTree, PVTree, Directree and Bush (also by me) are some I'm 
aware of. So Why use Shrub?

 1. It's very fast. For a listing of my SYS: partition (10MB, 102 drawers, 
    1254 files) here are the results (approx.) :
     DTree     : 36 (s)
     Directree : 20 (s)
     PVTree    : 10 (s)
     Bush      : 32 (s)
     Shrub     :  4 (s) !!! :)
     
 2. It has a nice WB2/3 user interface. You can even drop icons into Shrub's
    window to get listings. It's not Shell only like DTree and Bush, does 
    not have the horrid Amos GUI of Directree and is a little bit more 
    pratical than PVTree's very nice GUI.
    
 3. It's packed with features: 
     You can save the listing as ascii text. 
     Choose not to display Workbench icon files.
     Findout how many files and drawers are within a directory.
     Choose if you wish to traverse linked directories.
     View files.
     Alter a files Information.
     Find out if an item is a link, normal file, softlink or even a pipefile.
     You can search the created list for file matches.
    
 4. It's got a wild name (like a lot of my programs, Publican, Bush, MidMoose,
    WangiPad, NaeGrey, WoofWoof and DQua, I must be out of my heid :).
    
  Shrub requires Workbench 2 or better to work.
@endnode
@remark ********************************************************************
@node USAGE "Usage"
  Simply double click the icon. @{"Tooltypes" link ARG 5} and @{"program arguments" link ARG} are supported.
If you have WangiPad or Toolmanager installed then you could setup Shrub as a 
Workbench item/object You could then select a directory, select Shrub 
from the pad/dock/menu and get a tree listing of that directory.
  You can the use shift select from workbench to get a directory listing of
the selected drawer or file.

  SHRUB REQUIRES REQTOOLS LIBRARY, IT IS NOT SUPPLIED IN THIS DISTRIBUTION

	Once you've got Shrub on the go you can use the "Project/directory..." 
menuitem to get a listing of a new directory. You can also drag an icon into
the window, the directory that that icon is in will be listed. Items a 
listed in this with their name first followed occasionally by the other 
text. The other stuff means:

  (dir)      : this is a directory
  (dir) <hl> : this is a linked directory
  (dir) <sl> : this is a softlinked directory or file !!
  <hl>       : this is a linked file
  <pipe>     : this is a pipe file??
  
  If the "Settings/Show Icons?" menuitem is checked then Workbench Info files
(.info) will be shown in the list, if not then they wont!
  If a directory is linked ("(dir <hl>" or "(dir) <sl>") then its contents
will only be shown if the "Settings/Follow Linked Drawers?" menuitem is
checked.

  Double clicking on an item in the list will cause that file to be viewed
if the "Settings/View On Double Click?" menuitem is checked. The viewer
specified thru' the @{"VIEWER" link ARG} option will be used.
  If the "Settings/Info On Double Click?" menuitem is checked then
information on the file will be displayed. The display will be the same as
that obtained thru' Workbench's "Icon/Information..." menuitem. This feature
is only available if you have Workbench 3 or higher... so upgrade to 
Workbench 3.1 now!  

  The "Item" menu also allows the above functions to be used.

  The tree listing can be saved as ascii text thru' the "Project/Save As..."
menuitem. If the "Settings/Create Icons?" menuitem is checked then an icon
will be saved for the created file. 
  
  A hard copy of the tree listing can be produced by the "Project/Print"
menuitem. The preferences printer settings will be used.

  Some statistics can be viewed via the "Project/Statistics..." memuitem. A 
window will then appear, displaying the name of the drawer that the tree is 
based on; the amount of drawers within this directory; The amount of files in
the directory and the amount of files in the listing (remember .info files 
might not be shown)

  You can search the created list for a particular file using the 
"Search/Find..." menuitem. You can search for all files matching the specified
wildcard (see Amiga documentation for more info). To find a subsequent match
use "Search/Find Next".

  Shrub is not PD, if you find it useful then you should send me something.
Otherwise you could end up a pile of sticky marshmallow after you guilt
caused you to go into melt-down. Or even worse you could be locked up because
of the Wangi Demons flying round your heid, sticking little picks into your
skull, only nobody else sees them. You have been warned!

  So if you do find Shrub useful or are teriffied of the above then what do
you send me? Well Shrub is infact something called GiftWare, you send me 
gift of your choice. 
  If you enclose a SAE or equivelent with your gift then I will send you a 
disk with all the programs written by myself (over 20!!) plus some others.

@node VERH "Hmmm... interesting Ja, Ja Ja Ja ???"
  Shrub was programmed using Highspeed Pascal by Highsoft on an A1200 with
'030 CPU (Viper board), 2+4 MB RAM and 120 MB HD.
  Shrub has been tested using Enforcer.
  
1.0  : 09.10.94
     + Initial version.
    
1.1  : 11.10.94
     + Added the AppWindow.
     + Added size gadget. (Very crude, it closes the window and then reopens 
       it to the new size. How else can you alter a listview without crudding
       the window?)
     - Removed "Directory..." gadget, just use the menu now.
     
1.2  : 12.10.94
     + Added requester on quitting.
     + Changed "SPACETEXT/K/F" in the Shell arguments to "SPACETEXT/K" this
       now lets you have a space after any characters in the Spacetext, eg:
       " | " now works.
       
1.3  : 13.10.94
     + Added the "VIEWER", "LINKS", "INFOODC", "VIEWODC" and "SHOWICONS"
       arguments.
     + Added "Settings/Info On Double Click" and "Settings/View On Double 
       Click" menuitems.
     + Double clicking on an item in the list now gives you info on it and
       views it (depending on above added settings). 
       
1.4  : 20.10.94
     - Small changes (new version of HSPascal).
     
1.5  : 21.10.94
     - Default viewer is now "SYS:Utilities/Multiview" rather than "Multiview"
       so that if "SYS:Utilities" is not in the current path it will still 
       work.   
       
1.6  : 23.10.94
     - "Statistics..." will now state that a drawer is empty rather than saying
       "0 drawers and 0 files".
     - The "Directory" argument now correctly works with drawers again, it
       was using the parent of the drawer.
     - "Print" added.
     - "Save As..." and "Print" 
       - Says in text in directory is empty.
     - "Save As..."
       - Default file name now based on the tree.
       - Full name of the tree drawer is saved in the files comment field.
       - File now a project.
     - Menus rearanged.
     - "Statistics...", "Save As..." and "Print" menu items are now disabled
       if no tree is loaded.
       
1.7  : 27.10.94
     - All .info files are now masked out when "Settings/Show Icons?" is not
       enabled. .Info files were slipping thru'.
     - Double clicking on an item in the list will now print its fully 
       qualified path and name on the screen titlebar. If the item is a hard
       link then the item it is linked to will also be printed out.
     - "Search" menu added. Has no functionality at present but will in a 
       future version allow the list to be searched for a file/wildcard match.
       
1.8  : 28.10.94
     - Window is now resized rather than closed and reopened when the zoom
       or size gadgets are used.
       
1.9  : 30.10.94
     - Search function partially implememted. Has no GUI interface, a console
       window is opened for input/output. All files matching the pattern are
       listed in the console along with their line number. This line number
       can be used with the new "Search/Goto Line..." menuitem to locate the
       item. The "FULLSEARCH" option has been temparally added to specify
       that search results are to be fully qualifified paths.

1.10 : 06.11.94
     - "Goto Line..." improved, the default value in the requester was 2 less
       than it should have been (thus if you just pressed enter you would be
       2 places further up the list than you should be).
       
1.11 : 13.12.94
     - When activated from workbench, if shift select is used then the tree
       will be made of the selected icon.
       
1.12 : 16.12.94
     - Bug fix. Even if no icons were being shift selected Shrub thought they
       were.

1.13 : 24.04.95
     - Major Revision.
     - Completed search functions/added find next.
     - Removed Goto line item.
     - Added Item menu and its show and info items.
     - Removed the "Directory Tree" text from above the list.
     - Removed MagicWB icons... euch.

1.14 : 25.04.95
     - Bug fix: Searching enforcer hits and misc. bugs removed.
     - Modified the default values of LEFT and WIDTH.
     - Removed a spelling error (oops :), thanks CStar.
     - Tweeked Shrub.info
     - Improved the info given when a file is double-clicked, if it was a link
       before then it only said "xx hardlink to yy' now it says:
          "xx soft link to yy" or
          "xx hard file link to yy" or
          "xx hard drawer link to yy"
