1. Introduction and Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The (British) National Lottery has really caught the publics imagination.
But after the initial frenzy of picking six birthdays, ages or house numbers
have you ran out of numbers. MacCash can generate the numbers for you. These
numbers will have just the same chance of winning - 14M to 1 though.

   MacCash can also statistically analyse the numbers (so you can make up a
formula :) and print out the numbers. For a while in the earlier releases
MacCash also printed out the actual coupon but this was inacurate (and 
pointless?), It will probally will be added again in the future.

Note: MacCash is only really usefull for the British National Lottery. If
you live in an other country I recommend that you take a look at DiceRoll.
DiceRoll is a random number generator that can generate numbers upto any
limit and any number of them. It can be found in misc/misc on the aminet.


2. Usage
~~~~~~~~

   MacCash can be used from the Shell and Workbench. Version 2.04 or greater
of Workbench is of course required. One argument is supported from both the
Shell and Workbench, this is PUBSCREEN and it specifies the public screen 
that MacCash will open on.

   Once you have launched MacCash you will see a window with a main list,
which shows all the boards and numbers, some integer gadgets so that you can
change the numbers and some buttons which allow the random numbers to be 
generated and cleared. The use of these gadgets is fairly intuitive. (Don't
worry about the "Number of draws" gadget, it is fairly pointless now since
the coupon printing has been removed.)

   The "Statistics for Board" button will show you the standard deviation,
mean, median, range, interquartile range and variance for the current
board.

   The "Print Numbers" menuitem will print out the numbers of used boards.
