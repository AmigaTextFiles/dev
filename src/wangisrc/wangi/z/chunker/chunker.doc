 COMPILATION
-===========-

 This archive includes versions of Chunker and DeChunk for the Amiga (chunker
 and dechunk for 2.0 and higher, chunker13 and dechunk13 for 1.2 and higher)
 and MSDOS (CHUNKER.EXE and DECHUNK.EXE). The ANSI C source code is included
 in the source drawer. This source should complile with all ANSI C compilers.
 To compile the unix version simply type 'make' in the source directory. The 
 makefile does the following:
 
   CC -O2 -o chunker chunker.c machine.c bfn.c
   CC -O2 -o dechunk dechunk.c machine.c bfn.c
      ### ##########
       |      \
 turns |       \ specifies the name of the compiled program
 on level        to create.
 2 optimisation
 
 By default the (Unix) makefile uses the "CC" compiler - you may wish to
 change this to "gcc" for example, see the makefile for more info


 USAGE
-=====-

 Chunker is used to split a file up into smaller pieces. It expects the
 following arguments:
 
   chunker <file> <basename> <size>

 file: Name of the file to split.

 basename: The created split files will have this as their base name. For
    example if you had "ding" as basename then the created files would
    be:
    	ding.000
    	ding.001
    	:
    	:
    	ding.XXX
    Note that the XXX part is a 3 part hexadecimal number.

 size: Size (in bytes) of the created chunks.
 
 For example:

   chunker bigfile.gz bigfile 716800
 
 would split the file 'bigfile.gz' into 700k chunks with a basname of
 'bigfile'.
 
 
 DeChunk will reassemble the chunks output by Chunker into the original
 file. It expects the following arguments:

   dechunk <outputfile> <basename>

 outputfile: Name of the file to create.

 basename: The basename of the split files. For example if the first of the 
    split files is called "ding.000" then use "ding". This should be the
    same as you passed as basename to Chunker.
 
 
 NOTE the Amiga join or Unix cat commands could be used rather than dechunk,
 if you're a masochist that is ;)

 NOTE that the amiga 2.0 version accepts arguments in the normal ReadArgs
 format, just type 'chunker ?' and 'dechunk ?' for the template. The
 Amiga versions are also pure and reentrant, and as such can be made
 resident.

The initial concept and code for Chunker was by Evan Tuer. You can email
Evan at alienz@freenet.hut.fi. Of course he also came up with the name...
