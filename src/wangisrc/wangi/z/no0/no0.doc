no0 - Deletes all empty files in a directory.

Purpose

 main purpose it to delete the 0 length files left in the oubound directory
 by some fidonet mailers. I have heard that the lzx archiver does not like
 these and that when using Spot there is not way to stop them from being
 generated. Simply add this command to your mailers aftersession script.

Template:

            "OUTBOUND:"
