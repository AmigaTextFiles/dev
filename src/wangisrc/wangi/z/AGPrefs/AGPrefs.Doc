              Amigaguide preferences - Lee Kindness. - v />Version Amigaguide NN ND<\
              ======================================

Introduction
============

	Amigaguide has various preference options. However no preference editor
is supplied to alter them, now you can. This program requires OS36+ (WB2)
if you do not have this then lookup the AmigaGuide documentation to find 
out how you can change these preferences. AmigaGuide prefs is identical
to the C= preference editors, it is therefore easy to use. For more 
information on any of the preference options look at the AmigaGuide 
documentation in the "Preference" section.
	These preferences are not respected by Multiview in Release 3. I would
recomend that you use Amigaguide (copy V34 of Amigaguide to your LIBS: from
the Amigaguide distribution). In doing so online help will abide to your
preferences.

Installation
============

	The included install script will copy the program to SYS:Prefs. The C= 
installer is required in your path.

Usage
=====

	Double click from workbench or "SYS:Prefs/Amigaguide" from the Shell.
A number of arguments are supported, from the Shell the template is

FROM
	name of a directory specifying where to load the preference files from,
	defaults to "ENV:AmigaGuide/".

EDIT
	No purpose.

USE
	Don't open the window and save the preference files to 
	"ENV:AmigaGuide/". The settings from the specified file will be put
	effect.

SAVE

	"ENVARC:AmigaGuide/". Settings will be put into effect and will also
	be in use after a reset.

THE WINDOW
----------

	A window appears with three sets of gadgets. These gadgets are used to
change various preference settings of AmigaGuide. The gadgets:

"Path"
	This listview shows the list of directories that AmigaGuide will search
through in attempts to find files. A new path may be added using the "New"
button. You can edit this path by either changing the text in the string
gadget below the list or selecting the "Directory" gadget, this will cause a
requester to appear so that you can pick a directory from it. A path can be
removed using the "Remove" button.

"Text"
	This cycle gadget lets you pick what style the node points in an 
Amigaguide document appear as. You can choose from "Button", "Highlight", 
"Underline", "Bold" or "Italic".

"Sample"
	How a guide file would look using the current settings.

"Pens"
	This listview lets you select what colour certain features in an 
AmigaGuide document appear in. Select an item in the list view and then 
choose the colour you wish in the palette gadget below. The items in the 
list are self documenting.

"Save"
	This button saves the current preferences and exits.

"Use" 
	This button exits with the current preferences in effect.

"Cancel"
	This button exits with no change to the preferences.

The menu items do the following:

"Open..."
	Lets you pick a directory from which preferences will be loaded in from

"Save As..."
	Lets you pick a file to which the preferences will be saved.

"Quit"
	As "Cancel".

"Reset To Defaults"
	Changes the preferences to their default values.

"Last Saved"
	Restores the last saved preferences.

"Restore"
	Restores the preferences in use before the program was launched. 

"Presets"
	A submenu of predefined pen and/or text settings. For want of better names,
these items have fairly wacky names. For example "Skerza" (old Norse for
scary), "Strappado" (a form of torture where a person is tied to a rope and
then let to fall half the length of the rope), "Baked Beans", "heterophyte"
(a parasite) and of course the reoccuring "Wangi".

"Create Icons?"
	If checked then icons will be created via the "Save As..." menuitem. 
When these icons are doubleclicked their contents will be used.

History

AGPrefs was tested on:
	A1200, 120MB HD, 2+4 MB RAM, 68030 CPU running Enforcer
	A600 FD

	V36.23	: 12.08.94
				+ Initial Version

	V36.31	: 14.08.94
				- did not have enough stack, therefore program was vegging in 
				  some procedures (normally "Directory" function).
				- Fixed install script still had references to "Bush" (just 
				  changed a couple of bits from the bush script for AGP script)

	V36.32	: 05.09.94
				- Fixed Enforcer hits.

	V36.36	: 19.09.94
				- Palette gadget now bigger so that it is the same height as the
				  path gadgets.

	V36.40	: 21.09.94
				- Can now set "Pens" preferences to more than 8 colours.
				- Palette gadget now shows 207 (256 pre V39) colours (Amigaguide 
				  maximum) rather than 8

	V26.44	: 22.09.94
				- Palette gadget now shows the maximum number of colours 
				  available on the current screen or 207 if 256 or more are
				  available.

	V36.66	: 23.09.94

	V36.101	: 27.10.94

				- Added the "Sample" display.

	V36.132	: 06.11.94
