           NaeGrey -- Remove those ugly grey screen borders
                    Copyright (c)1995 Lee Kindness

Introduction
============

        Sick of that grey border around your screens? Well NaeGrey
will remove it, making it black. Some similar utilities already
exist, but NaeGrey has the advantage of being OS friendly, Workbench
2 compatible and small in size.

Installation
============

        Use the Install script provided... some strange things have
to be set up...:)

Usage
=====

        When launched from the shell, NaeGrey has the following
template:

             SCREEN/M,ALL/S,BLACK=ON/S,GREY=OFF/S,QUIET/S

SCREEN: The names of the public screens to modify. Note public screen
names are case sensitive and are normally documented in the creating
applications documentation. Multiple names may be specified.

ALL:    Specify that all open public screens should be modified. This
is on by default if SCREEN is not specified.

ON:     Turn the black border on.

OFF:    Turn the black border off.

(If neither ON or OFF is specified then the border state is toggled)

QUIET:  Don't show the output.

        If launched from Workbench then the ALL option is assumed and
the border is made black (ON).

Version History
===============

1.0     10.04.95
        - Initial version, written in HSPascal.

1.1     13.04.95
        - System patch added (NaeGreyPatch).
        - When run from WB the black border is turned on (and not
        toggled as it was).
        - Shell template changed, BLACK can be used instead of ON,
        and GREY instead of OFF
