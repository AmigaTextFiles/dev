Introduction
============
	  NewExt is a shell only utility for changing the extension part of
  of a files name. NewExt supports AmigaDOS wildcards making a seemingly
  useless utility useful - Ever tried to rename all the .pic files in a
  directory to .ILBM? NewExt can. WB 2.0+ required.

Usage
=====
	  From the CLI/Shell :-

  WILDCARD/A,EXTENSION/A,FRONT/S,HELP/S,INFOS/S

  WILDCARD:
   Which files to operate on. Must be given.
   
  EXTENSION:
   The new extension for matched files. Must be given.
   
  FRONT:
   Specifies that the EXTENSION will be changed at the left edge rather than
   the standard right position. Useful for mod.#? etc.
  
  HELP:
   Will print out some information.
   
  INFOS:
   Specifies that the .info files of the files that are being renamed will
   also have their names changed.
        
  Eg/ NewEXT #?.iff .ILBM INFOS will rename all .iffs to .ILBM. including
                                their .info files
                                
      NewEXT (#?.sample|#?.sfx) .8SVX will rename all .samples and .sfxs to
                                      .8SVX
                                      
      NewEXT mod.#? pt3. FRONT will rename all mod.s to pt3.
