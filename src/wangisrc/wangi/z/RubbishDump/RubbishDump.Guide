@node N_INTRO "Introduction"

  The Workbench trashcan... It's pretty pathetic isn't? Glad you agree.
Rubbish Dump provides an easier alternative. You simply drag icons over a
central trashcan on the Workbench... and they're deleted just like that.
It also has a wee novelty - It can play a sample when you delete things (It
actually uses @{" ARexx " link N_AREXX} so it can do what ever you want really).

@node N_INSTALL "Installation"

  The provided installer script will install Rubbish Dump. It requires the
CBM Installer utility to be in your path.

@endnode
@remark *********************************************************************
@node N_CONFIG "Configuration"

  Rubbish Dump supports the following Workbench icon tooltypes:
  
LEFTEDGE
TOPEDGE : Specifies the co-ordinates of the trashcan icon on the Workbench.
          A negative or zero value will cause the icon to be positioned in 
          a free space. Defaults to a free space.

NAME    : The text that will appear below the trashcan icon on the Workbench.
          Defaults to "Rubbish Dump".

ICON    : The icon that will be placed on the Workbench as the trashcan icon.
          Note that the icon name should not have ".info" at the end. The
          Install script will copy some trashcan icons to DEVS:Icons (by
          default) so this tooltype should normally read:
          ICON=DEVS:Icons/***
          where *** is the name of one of the icons in DEVS:Icons.
          Defaults to using the program icon.

REXXPORT
REXXCMD : See @{" ARexx " link N_AREXX}.

  The above arguments are also supported as Shell parameters, following the
following format:

              X=LEFTEDGE/K/N,Y=TOPEDGE/K/N,I=ICON/K,N=NAME/K,
              RP=REXXPORT/K,RC=REXXCMD/K,CX_PRIORITY/K/N:

@node N_USAGE "Usage"

  For best effect Rubbish Dump should be placed in you WBStartup drawer 
(the installation script will always do this). You will then have a trashcan
on your Workbench everytime you use your Amiga.

  To delete a file or directory you simply drag its icon over the trashcan.
You can of course delete multiple objects at a time by shift-selecting 
icons. All files within a directory will be deleted if you drag a drawer or
disk over the trashcan.

  If a file is proteced from deletetion then a requester will ask if you
really wish to delete it. A requester will pop up if any other errors occur,
zb: trying to delete a drawer/file in use (assigned?).

  May you enjoy your deletion (the sound samples help :)

@endnode
@remark *********************************************************************
@node N_AREXX "ARexx support"

  Rubbish Dump uses ARexx to play the sound sample after every deletion.
The sound is played by Upd. You can however use this feature to do whatever
you want. zb: You could launch an ARexx script, use a module player to
play a short module...

  This feature is controled by the following tooltypes

REXXPORT : The port/client that the ARexx command will be sent to.
           Defaults to "PLAY". The name of this port will be in the 
           applications documentation.

REXXCMD  : The command to be sent to the above port.
           Defaults to "id TRASH".

  So if you wanted to launch an ARexx script you'd use:

  REXXPORT=REXX
  REXXCMD=<script name and path>

  If you wanted to play a module with Delitracker:

  REXXPORT=DELITRACKER
  REXXCMD=playmod <module name>

@node N_HISTORY "Version History"

 0.0  : 24.04.94
      - Original concept, was originally called AppTrash (but somebody else
        stole the name later) was also going to be an AppiSizer type utility.
        I got sick of the thing and developed another utility.
        
 0.1  : 19.01.95
      - Internal beta version.
      
 1.0  : 22.01.95
      - Original version proper.
 
 1.1  : 23.01.95
      BF- When the commodity was being disabled it was going into an infinite
        loop the next time something was dropped over the icon.
      (This version on Amiga Shopper June 1995 coverdisk 2)
      
 1.2  : 28.04.95
