@node INTRO "Introduction"
YourFault is a small hack that lets you change the error messages returned
by the system. You can replace each and every one with your own message.
For example instead of

     "Not a DOS disk"

you could replace it with

     "Banana in drive"

YourFault can also be used to @{"localize" link USAGE 56} the error requesters on Workbench 
2.0!!!

WORKBENCH 2 OR HIGHER IS REQUIRED. (of course...)
@endnode
@remark *******************************************************************
@node USAGE "Usage"
 Firstly install it using the supplied script. YourFault will be activated the
 next time you reboot your Amiga.

 Your fault reads the replacement error strings from a file specified by
 the Shell arguments or Workbench tooltypes:

   Shell template: "FROM:"
 
   Workbench Tooltypes: FROM

 The option FROM defaults to "S:FaultStrings".
 
 If YourFault beeps when run then it cannot find the specified strings file!
 
 The strings file has the following format:
 
   1. A '#', '|' or ';' in the first column of a line specifies a comment.
   
   2. The actual data is in the form:
       nnn:String
      where "nnn" is the error number (these are documented in the supplied
      file) and "Strings" is the replacement error text.
      
   3. It is recommended that replacement strings are less than 80 characters
      long.
      
   4. If a possible error number is not redefined then the built in ROM error
      string is used.
      
   5. A '^' specifies a newline... not really needed much.
   
   6. If a error string by default (see @{"deferrors.english" link deferrors.english/main}) has '%ld', '%s' or 
      similar tokens in it then you must preserve them in your replacement
      string (in the same order)
   
   7. If a default error string has '^' in it then you are probably best
      to put a '^' in your replacement
 
 The error requestors that dos puts up when a non-DOS disk is in the drive
 are built up from the INTERNAL_#? strings.

 If you are in a hurry to see your improved error messages then type the 
 following in a Shell:
  
   Fault <number>

 For example:

   > fault 212
   Fault 212: Not the right type... doh!


 YourFault is supplied with two example fault files:
 
  1. @{"FaultStrings" link FaultStrings/main} -- Copied to S: by the install script
  2. @{"deferrors.english" link deferrors.english/main} -- Equivalent strings to the English built-in.
 
 Several more are available in a separate archive (YourFaultStr.lha or 
 similar). Default files for all the standard 3.0 locales are in this archive.
 A side effect of this is that YourFault can be used to localize the error
 requesters on Workbench 2.0!!!
 
 You can create a default file for your local using the @{"GetDefErrors" link GDE} command.
@endnode
@remark *******************************************************************
@node GDE "GetDefErrors"
 The supplied utility command "GetDefErrors" can be used to create a
 file containing the default error strings. This is useful because the default
 strings change with locale. You should quit or deactivate YourFault before
 using GetDefErrors.
 
 To use GetDefErrors you simply launch it from a shell. It will then create
 a file called "DefErrors.fault" which will contain the error strings in
 a format usable by YourFault.
@endnode
@remark *******************************************************************
@node QUIT "Quitting"
 To quit you can send a Ctrl-C break to YourFault, run it again and select
 quit or select "Remove" from the commodities exchange.
 
 NOTE: If you here a beep after quitting then YourFault has been unable to
 free a jump table. This is because another program has patched the same 
 functions (probably you have changed your locale). The method used in 
 removing the patches makes this loss of memory neccessary but it also makes 
 the patch removal safe.
@endnode
@remark *******************************************************************
@node NOTES "Notes"
	YourFault patches a private AmigaDOS function... so I make no guarantee
	that it will work with future versions of the operation system...
	dosPrivate5() is the function that is patched.
	
	If you change your locale then you will have to quit YourFault and run
	it again.
@endnode
@remark *******************************************************************
@node TODO "Things To Do..."
 The following things may be added to YourFault:
 
   1. Play a sound sample (via a daemon such as Upd or MSD) when an error
      report occurs... Maybe not!
   2. Well... suggestions!

 Source code for YourFault can be found in the archive "YourFaultSrc.lha" in
 util/boot on aminet.

@node VER "Version History"
1.0  06.05.95
     - Initial Version

1.1  28.05.95
     - Now a commodity, can use cx to quit, disable.
     - '#' and '|' now used as a comment in the strings file aswell as ';'
     - Code now uses SFPatch.h (dev/c on aminet)
     - Now supports Shell arguments and Workbench tooltypes, only one
       option (FROM) is currently recognised.
     - Program will take less time to quit now... (due to using SFQ_WAIT in
       sfpatch.h)
     - Fixed bug in replacement Fault(), was returning BOOL. Now returns LONG
       number of bytes copied as per the autodocs.
     - New Icon... still quite rubbish but better than the last one. I would
       like to have a banana sticking out of a diskdrive as the icon but
       my drawing skills do not stretch that far... Icon any1 ??
     - Added a strings file which is equivalent to the defaults.
     - Added to the documentation.

1.2  07.06.95
     - Removed the patches on Fault() and PrintFault()... now patches a
       private AmigaDOS function !! (dosPrivate5())
     - As a result of the above Fault(), PrintFault() and ErrorReport() are
       all patched because they all call dosPrivate5()
     - '^' now used as a newline marker in the fault strings file.
     - Program reduced in size (5648->4744)
     - Added GetDefErrors to the archive.

1.3  XX.06.95
     - Log file option added.
     - New distribution archive which contains the default strings for the
       standard locales.

1.4  15.06.95
     - Removed log file option.
     - Added new icon :) (thanks Tom!!) and a banana animation.
     - Source moved to another archive (YourFaultSrc.lha)

1.5  26.06.95
     - Minor changes.
     - Added fidonet mail address.

1.6  13.11.95
     - More minor changes
     - Updated docs so that they are now compiled using Umentiler.
