                MidMoose version 2.0 (BETA) - ©Lee Kindness
                ===========================================

This is a beta version of MidMoose version 2. Just sling "MidMoose" into your
wbstartup drawer. 

MidMoose emulates the middle mouse button for mice (moose) that don't have
one. Currently no tooltypes are supported. a press on "left Amiga z" 
corresponds to the MMB.

Expected for 2.1:

 Tooltypes,
 Documentation,
 More testing,
