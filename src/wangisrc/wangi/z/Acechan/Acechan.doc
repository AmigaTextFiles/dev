Purpose
~~~~~~~
   hmmm... good question! Acechan produces datafiles which contain random
spread information. Use the data as you like, random background noise ??
Acechan was made for my good friend Acechan :). Acechan requires Workbench
2 or higher (but you could modify the source to work with any other system).

   Acechan is dedicated to Acechan (of theend) ....:)

Use
~~~

From the Shell Acechan has the following template:

   MINIMUM/N,MAXIMUM/N,ITERATIONS/N,DP/K/N,RAWONLY/S,SCALE=HASHPER/K/N,
   NOSYSHOG/S,OUTPUTFILE

MINIMUM:    The minimum integral value of the range.
MAXIMUM:    The highest value of the range (integer).
ITERATIONS: Number of data samples to perform. (min 10)
DP:         Number of decimal places to be used in the output. a minus number
            specifies engineering notation should be used.
RAWONLY:    If specified then the 'graphical' representation will not be 
            produced, only the raw data will be output to the file.
HASHPER:    In the graphical representation a hash will be output for every
            HASHPER occurances of the item. This implements a scale function.
NOSYSHOG:   If specified then the system will easier to use while Acechan
            does its stuff...
OUTPUTFILE: File to output to.

If an option is not specified then these are the defaults:
MINIMUM=1
MAXIMUM=100
ITERATIONS=1000
DP=4
HASHPER=1
OUTPUTFILE=acechan.results

Ex/

Acechan 3 123 20000 DP=9 hashper 5 out.txt
would set the following options:
MINIMUM=3
MAXIMUM=123
ITERATIONS=20000
DP=9
HASHPER=5
OUTPUTFILE=out.txt

All output is put into the OUTPUTFILE, best run the program and take al look at
the results...

Version History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.0 : 18.04.95
    - Initial version.

1.1 : 26.04.95
    - Added RAWONLY/S option. Ace was wanting to run the program with
      ITERATIONS = 10000000... the output file would have been massive...:)

1.2 : 30.05.95
    - Added HASHPER option so that the graphical representation can be 
      limited to a sane scale.

1.3 : 12.06.95
    - Added "SCALE" as shortcut for "HASHPER".
    - Added "NOSYSHOG"
    - Data file changed:
      - lines which contain comments or secondary data now start with ';'
      - Preferences used when the file was created are printed at the top
        of the file.
