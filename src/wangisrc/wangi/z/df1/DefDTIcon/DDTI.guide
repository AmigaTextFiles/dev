@node "FOREWORD" "Foreword"

  DefDTIcon (DDTI) creates a menu item on the Workbench tools menu. When this
item is picked any icons that are selected have their icon imagery changed to 
the default for their datatype. If datatypes library is not available then the
images used are those of the default tool, etc.
  DDTI requires at least Workbench 2, and Workbench 3 for use of the datatypes 
feature. @{" Distribution " link Distribution.doc/main}

  The included install script should be used to install DDTI.

@node "USAGE" "Usage"

  To use DDTI select icons on workbench (shift click/marque) and select
"Default icon" from the tools menu.

  A number of program arguments are supported, these may be entered as 
Workbench tooltypes or used as command line arguments:

COARSE : Specifying this argument makes DDTI load in one of the base datatype
         icons, determined from the datatypes groupID, see below.
         
NODATATYPE : Specifying this forces DDTI to use the default project icon for
         all data files. With this enabled DDTI acts exactly like DefIconer.
         
NOTOOLWIN : Specifying this forces DDTI not to change the icons Toolwindow 
         pointer when changing icons. The Toolwindow is currently not used
         but in future OS releases it may be and the copying of it from
         the default icon may be undesirable, so I added this option.
         
DEFAULTTOOL : If set then the icons "default tool" field is changed to match 
         the default icons "default tool" field.
         
NOTOOL : If set then the icons of tools will never be changed. This is useful,
         for example if you've just got a new PD program but all the data
         icons are dogger so select everything and defaulttool and all
         the datafile icons will be changed but not the main program icon.
         
ICONDIR : Where to load the default icons from. Defaults to "DEVS:Icons".
         
  The template from the Shell is:
  
TEXT/K,COARSE/S,NODATATYPE/S,NOTOOLWIN/S,DEFAULTTOOL/S,NOTOOL/S,ICONDIR/K




  When DDTI tries to load in a default icon a number of steps are taken:
  1. If the file is a disk or drawer then the default WB icon for it is used.
  2. If a file is a program then the default wb tool icon is used.
  3. if COARSE is selected then the icon name is based on the files groupID.
     This is in the form "ICONDIR:def_"+groupID name. The following default
     icons should exist for this mode:
       ICONDIR:def_syst : for system files
       ICONDIR:def_text : for formatted/unformatted text
       ICONDIR:def_docu : for formatted text which may contain other datatypes
       ICONDIR:def_soun : for sounds
       ICONDIR:def_inst : musical instruments used for musical scores
       ICONDIR:def_musi : musical scores
       ICONDIR:def_pict : still pictures
       ICONDIR:def_anim : animated picture
       ICONDIR:def_movi : animation with audio track
     if the appropriate icon is not found then the default project icon is 
     used. Note ICONDIR: is the path set by the option "ICONDIR", defaulting
     to DEVS:Icons.
   4. If COARSE is not selected then the icons name is based on the files
      datatypes name. If this fails then the datatypes basename is tried 
      and then step 3. is tried and if this fails then the default project 
      icon is loaded.
      
  To determine what icon will be used for a certain file you can allways use
a system monitor (eg. the excellent SnoopDos) to determine the files DDTI
is looking for.
 
  Several datatypes are supplied with the program, these are only the datatype
descriptor part of the datatypes and cannot be used to load programs into 
multiview etc. 

NB.
	You may find that animations (for example) have the Def_Sys icon attached to 
them by DefDTIcon. This is not a bug, it is due to the instrument, music,
animation and movie Datatypes only being supplied with WB3.1+.

@node "THANKS" "Ta Billy"

  Various people who deserve "Ta Billy's" for the icons, myself :), 
Tom Ekström (IconPack), Tom Pettigrew, Jon Pettigrew, Adam Kindness and 
others that I can't mind.

@node "VERSION" "Version history"

  DDTI is written in HighSpeed Pascal on an Amiga A1200.
  
  1.0 : 21.06.94
      - Initial version.
      
  1.1 : 24.06.94
      - Added NODATATYPE and NOTOOLWIN arguments.
      
  1.2 : 14.07.94
      - default icon is now based on the files datatypes name and not the 
        base name.
      - removed FORCEFTXT argument as it is now obsolete (because of above)
      - New CBM installation script.
      - Added the datatypes. 
      
  1.2a: xx.08.94
      - Removed Datatypes.
      
  1.3 : 20.09.94
      - Misc. obscure bug fixes (DDTI no does not alter WBAPPICON and 
        WBDEVICE type icons).
        
  1.4 : 01.10.94
      - DDTI nolonger tags the icons it alters, it' not very compatible 
        behaviour afterall.
      - Requester now shown when DDTI is quit.
      
  1.5 : 29.10.94
      - Added "DEFAULTTOOL" option. If set then the icons default tool is
        changed to match the default icons default tool.
      - If run from the Shell then arguments are now parsed by ReadArgs()
        and not FindToolType().
        
  1.6 : 05.11.94
      - Added "NOTOOL" option. If specified then tool icons will never be 
        changed.
      - Icons no longer loaded in from "ENV:Sys". The "ICONDIR" option
        specifies their location (defaults to DEVS:Icons). This saves copying
        the icons from ENVARC: at startup and also saves memory if ENV: is 
        in the ram-disk.
        
  1.7 : 03.12.94
      - Removed AskDDTI from the distribution, was quite useless.
        
        
KNOWN BUGS:
  If you try to use DDTI on a linked directory then the icon will be changed
  on the actual drawer and not the link. This is due the a bug in Workbench.
  It passes a lock to the physical drawer and not the link.

@node "WAFFLE" "Contact"

  I can be contacted at:
  
   8 Craigmarn Road
   Portlethen village
   Aberdeen
   AB1 4QR
   Scotland.
   
  The program is supplied with a number of datatypes, if you require another
then feel free to send me at least three example files, if possible an icon
to be used as a default and £2 (or equivelent) and I will create a datatype 
for you and send you it and the latest version of DDTI and a number of other
programs.
  Please send in any smart icons that you have, I can then distribute them 
with DDTI as default icons.
  If you find DDTI useful then let me know. Any gifts, cash and
even bug reports are greatly appreciated ¿-) If you want the current 
version of DDTI (and a wad more progs) then send £3 (or equivalent of 
£5 plus) to me.
