              Bush - Version 1.4 - Lee Kindness.
              ==================================
              
Introduction
============
   Many of you may have seen Tree on PC machines. Bush is similar to Tree. 
 Bush produces directory listings showing the structure of a directory and 
 all sub-directories. Why Bush you may ask, we already have DTree on the 
 Amiga? Simple speed and simplicity. Bush's advantages over DTree : 
 
       - Speed, up to 15%+ faster.
       - Does not require WB 2.
       - More compact output.
       - Aditional features 
         - size display
         - protection display.
       
 However there are some tradeoffs, there is no colour option and no support
 for PC fonts (Bush is usable and down-to-earth, does a simple tree need 
 colour and connected branches?).
 
Usage
=====
