INTRODUCTION
============

	Publican is a public screen support utility. It allows you to set 
the default public screen, set global public screen behaviour flags and
obtain the name of the frontmost public screen (and write it to StdOut
or a local/global variable).
 
PUBLICAN REQUIRES WORKBENCH 2 OR HIGHER TO WORK DUE TO PUBLIC SCREENS ONLY 
EXISTING WITH WORKBENCH 2 AND HIGHER.

USAGE
=====

FROM THE SHELL:

	Publican's template is as follows:
	
P=POPPUBSCREEN/S,S=SHANGHAI/S,L=LIST/S,VAR=VARIABLE/K,GLOBAL/S,GUI/S,
DPS=PUBSCREEN=PUBSCR/K/F:

This translates to 

POPPUBSCREEN : toggle the current setting of the global POPPUBSCREEN 
	flag. When this flag is set screens will be poped to the front
	when windows open on them. Set by "POPPUBSCREEN" or "P".
	
SHANGHAI : toggle the current setting of the global SHANGHAI flag. When
	this is set all windows that do not specify a screen to open on
	will open on the default public screen. Set by "SHANGHAI" or "S". 
	
LIST : displays current system settings. Will show all public screens 
	available, the front public screen, current state of SHANGHAI 
	and POPPUBSCREEN flags and the name of the default public screen. 
	Set by "LIST" or "L".

VARIABLE : will write the frontmost public screen to the specified 
	environment variable. Set by "VARIABLE" or "VAR".
	
GLOBAL : If this is specified then the variable written by the VARIABLE
        option will be a global variable. Set by "GLOBAL"
	
PUBSCR : set the default public screen. All text specified after this 
	argument will be treated as the screen name. Note that screen 
	names are case sensitive and that a list of the current available
	public screens can be obtained using the LIST option. Set by
	"PUBSCR = public screen name", "DPS public screen name"
	or "PUBSCREEN = public screen name". The name of public screens
	can normally be obtained from the program that opened the screen's
	documentation.
	
If no arguments are given then the name of the front public screen will
be printed out. This behaviour is similar to GetPubName (© Michael 
Hohmann). This is useful for ` (back tick) use. If use use:

	PUBSCREEN=`Publican`
	
as a tooltype for a application then that program will open its window 
on the frontmost public screen.

FROM WORKBENCH:

	When launched from Workbench Publican opens a window. This 
window contains a list of all available public screens. Selecting a 
screen in this list will make it the default public screen.

	Two checkmark gadgets below the listview show the current setting
of the SHANGHAI and POPPUBSCREEN flags. Hitting these gadgets will alter
the status of the flags.
