The files may be transmitted by any means. However the complete collection
of files must be included when distributed. No more than the media cost 
and a small copying cost may be charged for the files (ie. if you pay £2 or
£3 per disk for PD then you are a donkey of a geek).

ALTHOUGH THE FILES HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY TESTED ANY ERRORS OR ACCIDENTS
