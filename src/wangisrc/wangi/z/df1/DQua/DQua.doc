Introduction
============

  DQua is a simple utility for obtaining the roots of quadratic equations

Usage
=====

        DQua is started by double-clicking its icon or typing DQua at the 
  Shell prompt.
  
        All input to DQua is through the use of 3 string gadgets: a, b, and c.
  Each gadget represents a value related to the general quadratic form:
  
                            ax + bx + c = 0  
                            
  All input to DQua must be in this form. So for example to solve the 
  following equation, brackets must be multiplied out and the result rearranged.
   
                                (t+1) + 2t = 8t
                       =>  (t+1)*(t+1) + 2t = 8t
 multiply out brackets =>  t + 2t + 1 + 2t = 8t
             rearrange =>       t - 4t + 1 = 0
                                |    |    |
                                /    |    \
                               /     |     \
                           a = 1  b = -4  c = 1
                           
  Simply enter the values and hit the 'solve' gadget to solve.


History
=======

  DQua is written in HighSpeed Pascal on an Amiga A1200 120MBHD.

	1.00	: 05.02.94
			- initial release (also on AUI August coverdisk)
			
	1.1	: 22.07.94
			- Improved documentation.
			
			- Future:
			   NONE, the only changes to DQua will be bug fixes (if any), I
			   will not continue to work on DQua as I dont use it...
			   
	1.2	: 06.09.94
	      - Removed Enforcer hits.
