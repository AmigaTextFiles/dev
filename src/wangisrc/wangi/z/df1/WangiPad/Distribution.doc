The following will from here on be refered to as the "files":

  Distribution.doc.info            Install_WangiPad
  Install_WangiPad.info            OtherProgs.doc

The files may be transmitted by any means. However the complete collection
of files must be included when distributed. The files must not be changed 
in any way (including icons). No more than the media cost and a small copying 
cost may be charged for the files (ie. if you pay more than £3 per disk for 
PD then you are a real franglu).

The files are Shareware, copyright is retained by the author (Lee Kindness).
WBStart-Handler is © copyright Stefan Becker.

If the package is to be included in a commercial distribution (eg. magazine 
coverdisk) then a copy of the product should be sent to the author. If 
possible the author should be contacted before hand to ensure you have the
most recent version.

ALTHOUGH THE FILES HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY TESTED ANY ERRORS OR ACCIDENTS 
ARISING FROM THEIR USE IS NOT THE RESPONSIBITY OF THE AUTHOR. USE AT YOUR
OWN PERIL.
