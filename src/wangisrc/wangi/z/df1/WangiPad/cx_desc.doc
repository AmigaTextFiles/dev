                        Input Description Strings
                        =========================
                        
Description
===========

   The following regular expression outlines the format of the input 
description string as used in hotkeys:

   [class] {[-](qualifier|synonym)} [[-]upstroke] [highmap|ANSICode]
   
   Class can be any one of the class strings given below. Commodities will
assume that the class is rawkey if the class is not explicitly stated.

   rawkey
   rawmouse
   event
   pointerpos
   timer
   newprefs
   diskremoved
   diskinserted
   
   Qualifier is one of the qualifier strings from the table below. A dash
preceding the qualifier string tells commodities not to care if that 
qualifier is present. Note that there can be one or more qualifier (or none
at all) in the input description string. The qualifiers in the lefthand 
list can be used on all Workbench versions from 2.0, the righthand list only
if you are using greater than Workbench 2.1

   Workbench > 2.0                Workbench > 2.1
   
   lcommand                       left_command, lamiga, left_amiga
   rcommand                       right_command, ramiga, right_amiga
   lshift                         left_shift
   rshift                         right_shift
   lalt                           left_alt
   ralt                           right_alt
   capslock                       caps_lock
   control                        ctrl
   numericpad                     numericpad, numpad, num_pad
   lbutton                        left_button
   midbutton                      mbutton, middlebutton, middle_button
   rbutton                        rightbutton, right_button
   relativemouse
   repeat
   
   
   Synonym is one of the synonym strings from the table below. The strings 
act as synonyms for groups of qualifiers. A dash preceding the synonym string 
tells commodities not to care if that synonym is present. Note that there can 
be one or more synonyms (or none at all) in the input description string. 

   shift
   caps
   alt
   
   Several more synonyms were added in Workbench 2.1:
   
   backspace
   f1..f12
   break
   help
   comma
   home
   down
   cursor_down
   insert
   left
   cursor_left
   page_down
   right
   cursor_right
   page_up 
   up
   cursor_up
   pause
   del, delete
   return
   end
   space, spacebar
   enter
   tab
   esc, escape
   
   Upstroke is the literal string "upstroke". If this string is absent, 
commodities only considers upstrokes. If it is present alone then only 
upstrokes are considered. If preceded by a dash then both upstrokes and 
downstrokes are considered.

   Highmap is one of the following:
   
   space
   backspace
   tab
   enter
   return
   esc
   del
   up
   down
   right
   left
   help
   f1..f12
   
   ANSICode is a single character (eg 'a'). For class rawmouse the following 
are available with Workbench 2.1 or greater:

   mouse_leftpress
   mouse_middlepress
   mouse_rightpress 
   
Examples
========

   "rawkey lshift alt f2" - Function key F2 with left shift and either alt
   key pressed.
   
   "rawkey numericpad *" - The asterix key on the numeric pad.
   
   "rawmouse mouse_middlepress" - (WB 2.1++) The middle mouse button.
