1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   DiceRoll generates random numbers. It works in a similar way to dice,
a die has a certain number of sides and you throw it a certain numer of
times. With DiceRoll you can specify the maximum number (die size) and the
amount of numbers to generate (number of throws).

   The uses of DiceRoll range from generation of lottery numbers (for UK
National Lottery use MacCash) to "Wargames".


2. Usage
~~~~~~~~

   From the Shell you type:
   
   dr [die size] [number of throws]
   
So if you wanted to roll a 10 sided die 5 times you would type:

   dr 10 5
   
If you omit the size parameters then it is assumed you want one throw of a
six sided die.
