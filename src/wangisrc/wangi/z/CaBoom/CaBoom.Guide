@node INTRO "Introduction"

 CaBoom 'explodes' windows when you open and close them. When a window is 
 opened trails start at the mouse pointer and arc round to the position
 and dimensions of the window. When you close a window the trail start at
 the window and grow smaller towards the mouse pointer.

@node USAGE "Usage"
 
 CaBoom supports a number of tooltypes:
 
 SPEED: this sets the speed that the window explodes/implodes. 0 is the 
        fastest. The argument is actually the time in microseconds between
        each frame of the explosion. Default 10000.
 
 LINE:  this sets the line pattern. The argument is specified as a decimal
        number, but it is best worked out using a 16 bit binary number and
        then converting that to decimal. For example if you want the 
        explosion lines to be dotted (ie 1010101010101010 in binary) then
        you would set this tooltype to 43690. Default 65535 (ie full line)
 
 NOBACKDROPS: if this option is specified then backdrop windows will not be
        exploded. Best to try it... Default unspecified (ie False)
 
 These can also be specified if you launch CaBoom from a Shell:
 
           SPEED/K/N,LINE/K/N,NOBACKDROPS/S,CX_PRIORITY/K/N
 
 To quit CaBoom you can send it a CTRL-C break, run it again and select
 quit or select quit from commodities exchange.

@node DIST "Disclaimer, Distrubution and Copyright"

 Disclaimer
 ~~~~~~~~~~
 I hereby reject any liability or responsibility for these or any
 other consequences from the use of CaBoom whatsoever. This includes,
 but is not limited to, damage to your equipment, to your data,
 personal injuries, financial loss or any other kinds of side effects.
 Although CaBoom has been tested thoroughly on several different
 machines, I cannot rule out the possibility that CaBoom

     1. is somehow incompatible to your equipment
     
     2. has bugs that show up on your equipment
     
     3. does not do what it is supposed to do on your equipment
     
     4. does not work with future versions of AmigaDOS.

 It is your responsibility to take any precautions necessary to
 protect yourself from these or any other effects. I explicitly
 reject any liability or responsibility from the consequences of you
 using CaBoom

 Distribution
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 CaBoom may be freely distributed and copied, as long as the following 
 conditions are fulfilled:

     1. All parts of the program and the documentation must be complete.
        The distribution of single parts or incomplete subsets of the
        original distribution is forbidden.
        
     2. If CaBoom is to be included in a commercial distribution (including
        magazines!) then I must be sent a copy of the product (or if it is a 
        mag that I am subscribed to then an increase in subscription). It 
        would be better if you contacted me beforehand to ensure you have the 
        latest version. In any case full credit must be given within the 
        program documentation or magazine.
     
     3. If the included source code is used in another program then credit 
        must be given in the documentation.

 Note To Magazines
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 In the past I have had some of my programs included on magazine coverdisks
 without my permission when in the documentation it was stated that this
 was required... I want my programs on coverdisks but you _MUST_ read and
 fufil the "Distribution" section above. If you disagree then contact me
 or write a message in the AMIGA_MAGS echo...

@node TA "Thanks..."
 
 Thanks to...
 
  Bruno Costa: CaBoom is based on the source of Explode. Explode was written
  in 1991 and does not work with 2.0 and higher methods of opening windows.
  Explode also contained many bugs... :(
  
  Iain Sherrit: My Fido BOSS
  
  Jen Allen : The perfect ami user... :)
