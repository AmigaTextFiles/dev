@node INTRO "Introduction"

 The majority of large capacity 3.5" IDE drives take quite a while to
 spin upto speed. The problem is that the A600, A1200 and A4000 IDE interface
 does not wait for them. If the drive has not spun up within a certain time
 limit it is 'forgotten'. To use these drives you normally have to reboot
 again after a cold reboot. This is rather annoying to say the least. Also
 what if you wanted to turn on your Amiga via a timer switch so that you could
 collect email or backup your HD while you were asleep, you could not do it.
 SlowBoot offers a solution to this problem.
 
 Note that SlowBoot is not device dependant, it will work even with SCSI
 drives that are slow spinners (if such a problem exists...)

@node INSTALL "Installation"

 If the slowbooting drive is your main, SYS: drive then double-clicking on
 the "Make_BootDisk" icon will use the CBM intaller to create a bootdisk.
 If you leave this disk in your drive when you boot it will automatically
 boot your HD without you having to reboot. Note that the boot disk can
 also be in CC0: the PCMCIA slot and not just a floppy.
 The install script is self-documented, select help on any stage for more
 information.

 However if the slowbooting drive is not your main drive then you should
 add the following line to your startup-sequence:

@{i}SlowBoot DH1: NOREASSIGN@{ui}

 where DH1: can be any other device name. This line should be added after
 the Setpatch command. You may include more than one of these lines if
 you have more than one slowbooting drive. Note that you only put an entry
 for one partition on that drive and not one for each partition.

@node ADVANCED "Advanced Usage"
 
 The "Make_BootDisk" script will create a a bootdisk for your use. However
 not all options are catered for in it. You may want to change the following
 line that is in the created startup-sequence:
 
@{i}C:SlowBoot >NIL: ...@{ui}
 
 SlowBoot accepts the following template:

@{i}DEVICE/A,WAIT/N/K,NOREASSIGN/S,CMD=COMMAND/K@{ui}
 
 DEVICE -- The device name of the boot partition, normally this wiuld be
     DH0: but can be anything. Must be given.
 
 WAIT -- If the drive has not spun up then this is the delay (in 
     seconds) which to wait before trying again. Defaults to 1 second.

 NOREASSIGN -- When the drive has spun up and is being recognised by the
     system the command will simply quit, it will not reassign the system
     assigns to that disk or execute the startup-sequence on it.

 COMMAND -- The command to execute when the drive has spun upto speed. By
     default this executes the startup-sequence on DEVICE, ie:

@{i}Execute <>CON:///-1/AmigaDOS/AUTO/NOCLOSE/SMART s:startup-sequence@{ui}

     A usefult feature of this would be to change the name of the 
     startup-sequence... this would give good protection against viri that
     latch onto the startup-sequence!!

@node TECH "Technical"
 
 What doen SlowBoot really do? Well it first checks to see if @{"DEVICE" link ADVANCED 12} exists.
 If it exists then the drive has spun-up ok. If so it reassigns SYS:, C:, S:,
 ENVARC:, LIBS:, DEVS:, FONTS: and L: relative to @{"DEVICE" link ADVANCED 12} and executes 
 @{"COMMAND" link ADVANCED 19} (ie execute the startup-sequence on @{"DEVICE" link ADVANCED 12}). If @{"DEVICE" link ADVANCED 12} does not exist
 then the computer waits @{"WAIT" link ADVANCED 15} ticks and then reboots, giving the drive more
 time to spin-up.

@node HISTORY "History"
 
 1.12  : 11.09.95
       - First release.

 1.14  : 07:10.95
       - DELAY now defaults to 50.

 1.16  : 07.10.95
       - DELAY was ignored in version 1.14, it works now.
       - DELAY (which was in 50ths of a second) has been replaced with
         WAIT (in seconds).
 
 1.17  :
       - The make bootdisk script did not format the disk if SYS:System was
         not in your path. Fixed.

 1.18  : 17.10.95
       - A lock was not being freed. After WB had booted and you removed the 
         boot disk the icon would remain. Fixed.
