v1.15
    - In `View', whitespace kerning is now once again disabled by
      default. It's not widely used, and it might look somewhat cramped
      at times. Reintroduced the `S=SpcKern' command line switch, which
      now enables whitespace kerning in general.
    - In `View.c', removed the SPCKERN preprocessor macro.
    - Removed the sample text file `Text/BadKern'.

v1.14
    - In `View', the "diagnostic" `S=SpcKern' command line switch has
      been removed.
    - In `View.c', added a SPCKERN preprocessor macro that replaces the
      command line switch mentioned above. Also renamed the DEBUG
      preprocessor macro to DISPKERN.

v1.13
    - In `View', whitespace kerning is now re-enabled, but only when the
      second character in a kerning pair is a non-whitespace character.
      The main issue in the past was that sometimes (such as with the
      figure `1') extra kerning was added to a glyph when whitespace was
      the second character in a pair, and this kerning value would also
      propagate to each succeeding whitespace character. The `S=SpcKern'
      switch now merely acts as a diagnostic feature to show the
      incorrect whitespace kerning in these isolated cases.

v1.12
    - The point size for `View', `ViewChars' and `Rotate' is now
      interpreted as centipoints. So, to set e.g. 14.75 points, enter
      1475.
    - In `View', the tracking (letter-spacing) can now be adjusted with
      the `R=Tracking' command line keyword. The value is percent of the
      point size, either positive or negative.
    - In `View.c', checking for a NULL string pointer was not done
      before calling StrToLong(). Fixed.

v1.11
    - In `View', added a `T=TabFigs' command line switch to enable
      tabular (non-proportional) figures.

v1.10
    - Due to more problems with the kerning of whitespace than just the
      figure `1' case mentioned below, I've decided to disable it
      altogether by default. Not using whitespace kerning is not
      uncommon, though. Most programs I've seen, both on the Amiga
      platform and otherwise, don't use it. It can be enabled with the
      `S=SpcKern' command line switch if desired.
    - The `O=OneKern' switch has been removed.

v1.9
    - In the `View' program, kerning between the figure `1' and
      whitespace is now disabled by default, since it's rather wonky
      with several fonts for some reason. This kerning can be enabled
      with the `O=OneKern' command line switch. As an example of the
      bad kerning, run `View' with the sample file `Text/BadKern'
      using the `O=OneKern' switch.

v1.8
    - In `View.c', simplified the code for processing UCS-2 and UCS-4
      encoded text.
    - In 'View.c' and 'ViewChars.c', ScrollRaster() is now used to
      scroll the text in the window up, rather than using RectFill() to
      clear the whole window.
    - In `View.c' and `ViewChars.c', the output of the text can be
      paused/resumed with the Space key, or ended with the 'q' key.
    - New file `input.c' that handles IDCMP input.

v1.7
    - Corrected a typo in README; the default code point range in
      `ViewChars' begins at U+0021, not U+0020.
    - Moved the opening of the screen and the window to `window.c'.
    - The programs now make the newly opened screen use the video modes
      of the Workbench screen by default, rather than blindly assuming
      HiRes (640 horizontal pixels).
    - New command line keywords `V=VPModeID', `B=BitDepth' and
      `C=Colors'.
    - A small utility called `ListVPModes' has been included that lists
      available viewport modes that have a name, and their IDs.
    - The `I=Interlace' command line switch has been removed.
    - In `View' and `ViewChars' the descender (the portion of a glyph
      that extends below the baseline) can now be set. I wish there
      would be a way to calculate the descender automatically, but that
      seems to take using diskfont.library and OpenDiskFont(). I have
      made the `ViewDiskfont' program display some data about the font,
      among them the descender percentage.
    - In View.c and ViewChars.c, RectFill() painted over the borders.
      Fixed.
    - Moved the BumpRev revision files to `src/rev'.

v1.6
    - In `ViewChars', the `StartCode' and `EndCode' command line
      arguments are now expected to be hexadecimal values. It's more
      natural to use hexadecimal when dealing with Unicode code points
      after all.

v1.5
    - The sample text files `SampleTextUCS2' and `SampleTextUCS4' in the
      `Text' subdirectory stated that the ff, fi, fl and ffl ligatures
      are located in the Arabic Presentation Forms-A Unicode block. We
      need to get historical here. The Bullet engine was written at a
      time when the Unicode standard was at version 1.0, and these
      ligatures are in fact located in the Unicode 1.0 Private Use Area
      (U+E800-U+FDFF).

v1.4
    - Moved the source code to a `src' subdirectory.
    - Added a command line argument to `View' to set the leading
      (distance between baselines) in percent of the point size (default
      120).
    - `View' now supports UCS-2 and UCS-4 encoded text files.
    - Added a small program called `ViewChars' that lets you view a
      range of Unicode characters.
    - The programs can now be run from Workbench, although you won't be
      able to provide any command line arguments. The default text file
      for `View' is `Text/SampleText'.
    - Now letting the menu bar be visible when opening the window of a
      program.
    - Corrected a statement concerning `ViewDiskfont' in README
      regarding the need to use `avail flush' when changing the command
      line arguments. It only concerns the XDPI and YDPI values.
    - Moved the sample text files to a `Text' subdirectory.
    - Added icons to various files.

v1.3
    - Now using BumpRev to manage revisions. This should have been done
      earlier.
    - Added a note in README about diskfont.library and the Text()
      function seemingly not supporting any kerning information in the
      font. Also included an additional program called `ViewDiskfont'
      that displays a text string with a chosen font using
      diskfont.library and the Text() function for demonstrational
      purposes.

v1.2
    - The programs now open a new screen.
    - New command line switches: `N=NoKern' disables kerning (only
      applicable to `View'), and `I=Interlace' sets interlaced video.
    - The opened window is now made active by using the WA_Activate tag
      in OpenWindowTags() in BulletMain.c and BulletMainFile.c.
    - In View.c, RectFill() didn't fill the whole window. Fixed.
    - In View.c, obtain the width of whitespace characters with
      ObtainInfo() and the OT_WidthList tag, rather than just using 1/4
      em as the width. Also adjust the kerning of whitespace.
