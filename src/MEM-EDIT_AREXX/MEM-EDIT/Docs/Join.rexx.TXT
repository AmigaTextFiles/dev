                             ----------------

  Minimum Requirements Are:-
  --------------------------

           Any Classic Amiga, including WinUAE.
           FULL, standard Kickstart 3.0x and Workbench 3.0x or better.
           RexxMast running, and RX in the path.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Join.rexx Usage:-
  -----------------

  IMPORTANT NOTE:- There is NO error detection OR correction in this code.

  On program startup a default window is opened. Two lines are printed to
  this window, (not inclding the line numbers)...

  1) $VER: Join.rexx_Version_00-00-22_Public_Domain_13-06-2009_B.Walker_G0LCU.
  2) Double click on the first file to join...

  A file requester is opened to the default S: VOLUME with the file
  Startup-Sequence ready to be OK'd if required.

  Double clicking on ANY file at all will automatically save it to the S:
  VOLUME as S:TEMPFILE. If you click 'Cancel' the the script WILL generate
  an error BUT WILL carry on... Irrespective however the next lines printed
  are...

  3) File saved as S:TEMPFILE...

  4) Double click on the next file to join...

  Another file requester is opened for the next file to join to S:TEMPFILE.
  Again double clicking on ANY file at all will join that file in FRONT of
  S:TEMPFILE and is saved to the S: VOLUME as S:BINARY.BIN. Also again
  clicking on 'Cancel' WILL generate an error as before.

  The next two lines printed are...

  5) File saved as S:BINARY.BIN...

  6) Press <RETURN/ENTER> to CONTINUE, or, Q<RETURN/ENTER> to QUIT:-

  Pressing <RETURN/ENTER> will cycle through this code again BUT IF you
  want to add to the BINARY.BIN file during the CURRENT session, just
  double click on S:BINARY.BIN as the FIRST file and for the SECOND file
  that you want in FRONT of the BINARY.BIN, (now a new S:TEMPFILE), just
  double click on that too.
  Pressing Q<RETURN/ENTER> starts the Quitting proceedure...

  The window is cleared and the lines printed are...

  7) Files now joined as T:BINARY.BIN...

  8) Delete the S:TEMPFILE file...
  9) Delete the S:BINARY.BIN file...

 10) Quitting...

  After a few seconds the window closes down.

  There is now a copy of S:BINARY.BIN in the T: VOLUME as T:BINARY.BIN
  so that you can save it elsewhere and/or rename it your leisure.

  In the 'S' drawer of this archive is a file 1KB.BIN. This is a joining
  of the files 00F80300, 00F80200, 00F80100 and 00F80000 in three loops.
  This was saved as T:BINARY.BIN, renamed to T:1KB.BIN and copied to the
  above drawer to view. It is obviously the first 1KB of the ROM 3.1x image.

  The default tool inside the 'Join.rexx' project icon is More. Just change
  the default tool to suit your needs, for example RX to run the srcipt.

  Below is the ORIGINAL ARexx code so that there is a reference to look back
  at when viewing any current versions that may appear... :)

/* Issued as Public Domain and you can do as you please with this code. */

/* To join addresses together start with the highest HEX dump */

/* Similarly with textfiles 'Last In First Out'... :) */

/* Pick the last, (address?), file needed from the S: VOLUME... */
/* IMPORTANT!!! DURING THE CURRENT SESION IF 'S:BINARY.BIN' EXISTS THEN */
/* THIS BECOMES THE NEW LAST ADDRESS/FILE!!! */

/* Set up any variables... */
  quitkey = ''

/* Use default window for prompts... */
/* This will loop to generate a manual binary dump... */
  DO FOREVER
    ECHO 'c'x
    ECHO '$VER: Join.rexx_Version_00-00-20_Public_Domain_01-06-2009_B.Walker_G0LCU.'
    ECHO 'Double click on the first file to join...'
    ADDRESS COMMAND 'C:Join `C:RequestFile DRAWER S: FILE Startup-Sequence` AS S:TEMPFILE'
    ECHO 'File saved as S:TEMPFILE...'
/* Now pick the next lower or earlier, (address?), file from the S: VOLUME... */
    ECHO 'Double click on the next file to join...'
    ADDRESS COMMAND 'C:Join `C:RequestFile DRAWER S: FILE Startup-Sequence` S:TEMPFILE AS S:BINARY.BIN'
    ECHO 'File saved as S:BINARY.BIN...'
    ECHO 'Press <RETURN/ENTER> to CONTINUE, or, Q<RETURN/ENTER> to QUIT:-'

    Testing Evaluation:-
    --------------------

    An A1200 in 2MB, 6MB and 10MB modes using trapdoor memory AND/Or PCMCIA
    memory expansions. WinUAE version 1.5.3 in classic Workbench 3.0x mode. 

    All test conditions were/are running STANDARD OS3.0x, and using standard
    ~topaz 8~ fonts throughout.

    I have no idea what a strange configuration setup will create so refer
    to the ~The Legal Stuff~ above.
