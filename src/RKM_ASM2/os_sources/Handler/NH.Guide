       NumericPad Handler V1.00 - By: John White - Shareware (£2.50).
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
@{fg text}
 NumericPad Handler (NH) V1.00 is an Handler that uses the NumericPad to
 perform certain functions and to give use to some of the keys. Instead of
 having a redundant part of the keyboard by your side why not use those
 extra keys.

@node Starting "Getting Started"

@{fg shine} From the Startup-Sequence@{fg text}

 Put AddNH into the C drawer, of the floppy disk or hard drive you are going
 to boot with. To run AddNH simply re-boot your amiga. If you try and boot
 from a floppy drive when you have an hard drive the hard drive will have
 priority over the floppy drive. If you only have floppy drives or only have
 a hard drive then AddNH will boot as normal.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From CLI@{fg text}

 Put AddNH anywhere you please. In your C drawer, Tools drawer or whereever.
 Start a CLI Process (I.e. use CLI, Shell or Workbench's `Execute' menu) and
 type the pathname for AddNH (I.e WORK:Tools/AddNH, AddNH, etc) and then
 press ENTER. This will run AddNH. Alternatively. Type the pathname for
 AddNH followed by one or more CLI Arguments and then press ENTER.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From Workbench@{fg text}

 Make sure there is a TOOL Icon on AddNH and then double-click on AddNH.
 This will run AddNH, which will then read the TOOL Icon for AddNH ToolTypes
 If it finds any it will set the appropriate values inside AddNH.

 @{" ToolTypes    " Link "ToolTypes"}
@endnode

@node Arguments "CLI Arguments"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of AddNH CLI Keywords with their Arguments. AddNH will not
 interpret an argument if its keyword is missing. I.e You cannot just type
 the argument -32 without typing the keyword HANDLERPRIORITY for example as
 other keywords might use a -32 argument. Thus, AddNH would have an hard
 time differentiating everything.

 You can use more than one keyword/argument set. Example:

 AddNH SETGAMEPORT MOUSEINJPORT SETBORDER BORDERON HANDLERPRIORITY -32

 Keywords and Arguments must be UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing in
 uppercase AddNH does not get clogged up with conversion code, opening of
 the Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} CLI Arguments@{fg text}

 SETGAMEPORT MOUSEINMPORT/MOUSEINJPORT

 This allows you to choose which GamePort the mouse uses. MOUSEINJPORT means
 the mouse will operate from the Joystick Port. MOUSEINMPORT means the mouse
 will operate from the Mouse Port


 SETCONTROLLER NOCONTROLLER/MOUSE/RELATIVEJOYSTICK/ABSOLUTEJOYSTICK

 This allows you to choose what type of Controller to use as a mouse.
 NOCONTROLLER means you want the mouse's port declared as empty. This could
 be of use to your Startup-Sequence if you do not want the user to be using
 the mouse upon startup for example. MOUSE means you want to use a mouse in
 the mouse's port. RELATIVEJOYSTICK means you want to use a relative
 joystick in the mouse's port. ABSOLUTEJOYSTICK means you want to use an
 absolute joystick in the mouse's port.


 SETBORDER BORDEROFF/BORDERON

 This allows you to choose wether or not to have a Border around your
 screen. BORDEROFF means you switch off (remove) the border. BORDERON
 means you switch on (use) the border.


 HANDLERPRIORITY Priority

 The priority can be -32, -16, 0, 16 or 32 (The allowed values of a software
 interrupt). However. I have used a default value of 100. 100 is the value
 used in the RKM example code for this kind of Handler.
@{fg fill}
 Default values are used when a Keyword/Argument is not used/entered.@{fg fill}
@endnode

@node ToolTypes "WorkBench ToolTypes"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of AddNH WB ToolTypes with their Arguments. AddNH will not
 interpret an argument if its tooltype is missing. I.e You cannot just use
 the argument -32 without using the tooltype HANDLERPRIORITY for example as
 other tooltypes might use a -32 argument. Thus, AddNH would have an hard
 time differentiating everything.

 Tooltypes and Arguments must be in UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing in
 uppercase AddNH does not get clogged up with conversion code, opening of
 the Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} WB ToolTypes@{fg text}

 SETGAMEPORT=MOUSEINMPORT/MOUSEINJPORT

 This allows you to choose which GamePort the mouse uses. MOUSEINJPORT means
 the mouse will operate from the Joystick Port. MOUSEINMPORT means the mouse
 will operate from the Mouse Port


 SETCONTROLLER=NOCONTROLLER/MOUSE/RELATIVEJOYSTICK/ABSOLUTEJOYSTICK

 This allows you to choose what type of Controller to use as a mouse.
 NOCONTROLLER means you want the mouse's port declared as empty. This could
 be of use to your Startup-Sequence if you do not want the user to be using
 the mouse upon startup for example. MOUSE means you want to use a mouse in
 the mouse's port. RELATIVEJOYSTICK means you want to use a relative
 joystick in the mouse's port. ABSOLUTEJOYSTICK means you want to use an
 absolute joystick in the mouse's port.


 SETBORDER=BORDEROFF/BORDERON

 This allows you to choose wether or not to have a Border around your
 screen. BORDEROFF means you switch off (remove) the border. BORDERON
 means you switch on (use) the border.


 HANDLERPRIORITY=Priority

 The priority can be -32, -16, 0, 16 or 32 (The allowed values of a software
 interrupt). However. I have used a default value of 100. 100 is the value
 used in the RKM example code for this kind of Handler.

@node Keys "Handler Keys"
@{fg shine}
 Extra Keys@{fg text}

 The idea behind using the following NumericPad Keys as extra (spare) keys
 is to limit wear/tear of the normal keys they emulate.

  8  2  4  6   Have become Cursor Keys. Use R-Shift to emulate Page-Up, etc.

           5   Has become SPACE BAR.

           7   Has become HELP.

           .   Has become DELETE.

       Enter   Has become RETURN
@{fg fill}
 The Handler stays active until you either remove it with the RemoveNH
 program (after pressing CONTROL 0 from within FunctionKeysNH, if you
 activated FunctionKeysNH) or you remove it by sending its Message Port
 a PMCOMMAND_QUIT instruction (after any other PMCOMMANDs have finished).
@endnode

@node Funcs "Handler Functions"
@{fg shine}
 Handler Functions@{fg text}

 The idea behind using the following NumericPad Keys for certain functions
 is so that you have those functions at the touch of two buttons instead of
 having to programme or CLI them yourself.

 R.AMIGA (      Switch Off the clicking sound of DF0:
 
 CONTROL (      Switch On the clicking sound of DF0:

 R.AMIGA )      Switch Off the clicking sound of DF1:
 
 CONTROL )      Switch On the clicking sound of DF1:

 R.AMIGA /      Switch Off the clicking sound of DF2:
 
 CONTROL /      Switch On the clicking sound of DF2:

 R.AMIGA *      Switch Off the clicking sound of DF3:
 
 CONTROL *      Switch On the clicking sound of DF3:

 R.AMIGA -      Switch Off the Border.
 
 CONTROL -      Switch On the Border.

 R.AMIGA +      The Mouse will operate from the Joystick Port.
 
 CONTROL +      The Mouse will operate from the Mouse Port.

 CONTROL 7      The Mouse Pointer will be operated by no controller at all.

 CONTROL 9      The Mouse Pointer will be operated by a Mouse.

 CONTROL 3      The Mouse Pointer will be operated by a Relative Joystick.

 CONTROL 1      The Mouse Pointer will be operated by an Absolute Joystick.

 R.AMIGA 0      Reset the Amiga.
 
 CONTROL 0      Switch Off NumericPad functions.
@{fg fill}
 The above keys are only available when you either use the FunctionKeysNH
 program or you send the handler's Message Port a PMCOMMAND_USENUMERICPAD
 instruction. The PMCOMMAND_USENUMERICPAD instruction sends the handler into
 a `monitor-the-keyboard' loop. When it is in this loop the amiga will
 become a bit slower. When you stop the loop, by pressing CONTROL 0, the
 amiga will return to its previous speed. Really you should: go into the
 loop with the FunctionKeysNH program, de/activate the function/s you need
 and then press CONTROL 0. I.e The handler should really be meant for the
 Handler Keys and not as a full-time keyboard monitor.
@endnode

@node HPort "Handler Port"
@{fg shine}
 Handler Port@{fg text}

 The Handler Port can receive Port Messages (See `Missing_Keys.i'). Apart
 from the other PMCOMMANDS_ instructions in the include file, there are
 (at the moment) only two important PMCOMMANDS_ instructions the port can
 receive. PMCOMMAND_USENUMERICPAD and PMCOMMAND_GETSTATUS.

 PMCOMMAND_USENUMERICPAD puts AddNH into a `monitor-the-keyboard' loop.
 The amiga will become a bit slower when this happens because AddNH is not
 sleeping - WaitPort() - until you press CONTROL 0. When you do press
 CONTROL 0 AddNH is put to sleep. pm_Status then has the value of 255, but
 cannot be returned as AddNH is sleeping. PMCOMMAND_GETSTATUS is used to
 get the pm_Status value. As you are sending a message (PMCOMMAND_GETSTATUS)
 AddNH can reply with the 255 pm_Status value.

 You MUST use PMCOMMAND_GETSTATUS after PMCOMMAND_USENUMERICPAD because even
 if you know the `monitor-the-keyboard' loop has finished how would you know
 if some other program has not re-issued a PMCOMMAND_USENUMERICPAD.

@node Update "Update Information"
@{fg shine}

 I will probably update AddNH to V1.1. It MIGHT have some of the following
 ideas put into it:

     -  A Speech and/or Audio function.

     -  Allow you to choose which keys use what function/key replacement.
