 The Library.s file is all you need for assembly programming. The rest is
 for C programmers - I just compiled it anyway. You will need to make your
 own FD file. I thought the LVO_Maker.s and Stubs.s files were going to do
 the FD file automatically but, although LIBINIT and LIBDEF do the actually
 *6 counting of the LVOs, the code does nothing for assembly programmers
 from what I can gather. I.e. there is no Write() out of an FD file within
 the code.
