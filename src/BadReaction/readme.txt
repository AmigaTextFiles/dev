This is a simple C example about creating a ReAction 
GUI with ReActor and how to use it in your application.

This example suits best with StormC4. 

ReActor and the documention for ReAction can be found 
on the Developer CD V2.1.

This piece of source is `Public Domain'.

History:
========

HowToReAction  1.0
- first version.

HowToReAction  1.1

HowToReAction  1.1a

Note: I (Robert Wilson) have uploaded this source code as I

C/C++ - I'm sure it's possible, but I desperately need assistance..

.. please help!

Robert Wilson.
