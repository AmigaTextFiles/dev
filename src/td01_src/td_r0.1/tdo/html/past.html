Oh it is well kown that the idea of TDO is certainly not mine.
There were other aproaches in the past, remember TDDD ?
<P>
A lot of conversion tools are out there, supporting file formats
which are more or less recent. But you can't launch them in your
prefered 3D application. Or they can't make output which could
be read by it.
<P>
And what happened with MeshWriter ? Never really published but
it worked very well. This was an export only library and supposed
to be expanded one day in an export/import library.
But each time I changed something in the core of MeshWriter I had to
change all savers. So TDO, the initial idea, was born even earlier
as planned.
