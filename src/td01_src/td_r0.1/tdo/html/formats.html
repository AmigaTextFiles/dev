Even if the library its main goal is to support developers
to generate easy 3 dimensional output, for raytracing applications and
other, 2D support is also integrated to get a certain view of an
object in a specific format.

<PRE>
  RAW ASCII            raw

   ASCII file which contains the name of the mesh on the
   first line. Followed by triangles printed as sets of 6 floating
   point values separated by a space.


  RAW binary           raw

   Binary representation of the above one. Name which is 0
   terminated and then triangles as sets of 6 points, each point is
   a 4 byte floating point value.


  AutoCAD DXF          dxf

   ASCII output which contains a layer per materials and
   interprets only the color information.

   The polygons are made with POLYLINE entities.

   Name and copyright are written.


  VRML 1               wrl

   ASCII file, which reflects the mesh as it is, with polygons
   and materials indexed on each polygon.

   Name and copyright are written.


  POVRay 3.X           pov

   ASCII file with standart light source and camera to be able
   to render the file and to get a correct view of it.

   Polygons saved as triangles and materials indexed to each triangle.

   Name and copyright are written.


  Lightwave            lwob

   Binary polygon represantation with full material support indexed
   to each polygon.


  Imagine original     iob

   Binary triangle represantation. Material indexed per triangle but
   without the shininess.

   18 characters of the name are written.

  Imagine huge         iob

   Binary, as above, but can store bigger objects. Supported on Amiga
   since version 3.0 of Imagine.


  Reflections 4.X      r4

   Binary triangle representation with materials indexed per triangle.

   Name is written.

   Recently renamed to monzoom or similar.


  VideoScape           geo

   Ascii polygon represantation with material information per polygon.

   Currently only the 16 default matte cololrs are built in.
