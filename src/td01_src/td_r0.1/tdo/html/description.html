The goal this shared library and its modular components is to provide
developers with a standart base for 3D applications which want to export
or import data, making a conversion tool or simple create a mesh and
make it persistent.
<P>
The end user himself will get applications which are able to save theyr
3D data in any possible format and to load files which were made with
foreign applications.
<P>
Not only 3D is supported ! Any data can be exported in a 2D format, such
as an IFF picture which displays the object in a perspectiv view, or as
simple Encapsulated PostScript file for publications and printouts.
<P>
2D import is possible too, but the way it has to work is not defined.
Images can be used to make a landscape by converting pixels to heights.
Or even more powerfull when recognizing rivers or other things.
<P>
The library is built modular, so that if a file format is not implemented
or not enough good, anyone can built his own extension module to save or
load any 3D data.
<P>
Each part, even the core of the library, can be replaced by another without
disturbing the rest.
