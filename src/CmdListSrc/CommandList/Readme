Lund, 1-Oct-98

Since I have decided to leave the Amiga platform, I place CommandList and its
source in the public domain. You may do whatever you wish with it. CommandList
was developed mainly with the DICE C compiler. The source is not always
pretty, but this is the way things are. If you do decide to use this source,
I would appreciate an e-mail.

Thanks to everyone who ever developed hardware or software for the Amiga.
