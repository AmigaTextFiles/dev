DIRECTORY CONTENTS
------------------

This directory contains the source files for
all examples published in the "Guru's Guide,
Meditation #1: Interrupts".  These examples
(and the Guru's Guide itself) were written
by Carl Sassenrath, the master architect of
the Amiga's low-level multitasking operating
system and designer of Exec.

If you would like to learn more about these
examples, or more about Amiga interrupts in
general, you may obtain a copy of the Guide
from your local Amiga Dealer or directly
from:

        GURU'S GUIDE
        P.O. BOX 1510
        UKIAH, CA  95482

Each guide costs $14.95.  If you send for
one, please include $1.50 for postage ($4
if outside North America).  CA residents
include %6 sales tax.

We sincerely hope that these examples will
help increase the knowledge of programmers
and improve the general quality of programs
written for the Commodore Amiga.
