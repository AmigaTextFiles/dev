Below is a shar of my latest version of Paul Higginbottom's CIA timer
routines.  What's cool about this version is tasks can call a function
LocateTimerData, which locates the interrupt's is_Data area, hence
multiple tasks can use the same CIA timer to get a microsecond-resolution
realtime clock.  To check out the demo, compile it up, start 'ciatimer' then 
run 'ciafinder' anytime afterwards to see the elapsed seconds and microseconds
since starting ciatimer.  Ciatimer will remove the interrupt, clean up and
exit if it gets a control-C in its CLI.

The reason I didn't send this to the sources group is that it's not really big
and it's still really beta.  Flame me in mail or something if you think it's
inappropriate. -k
