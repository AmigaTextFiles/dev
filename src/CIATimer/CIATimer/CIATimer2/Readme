   originally by Paul Higginbottom, Public Domain

   hacked on by Karl Lehenbauer to produce a monotonically increasing
   microsecond clock, 12/30/88, Public Domain

   further hacking by Karl to provide arbitrary tasks the ability to locate
   the CIA interrupt's time data, 1/5/88, Public Domain

   cc +p ciatimer.c
   ln ciatimer.o -lcl32

To start up the timer, execute ciatimer.  To kill it, control-C.  The task
doesn't do anything except wait for the control-C and clean up afterwards,
removing the interrupt.

ciafinder may then be used to locate the is_Data section of ciatimer's
interrupt, where ciatimer writes its time data.

  ciafinder is a companion program to ciatimer.  When ciatimer is running,
  it has a timer interrupt installed for a CIA timer, ciafinder will locate
  it and get the time.  ciafinder contains the code you need for your
  application to find the microsecond-resolution CIA timer time.

  cc +p ciafinder.c
  ln ciafinder.o -lcl32
