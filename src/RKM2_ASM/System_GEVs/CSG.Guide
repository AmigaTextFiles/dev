     @{fg shine}Create Set-Up GEVs V2.01 - By: John White - Shareware (£2.50)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

               Requirements: At least KS V37.300, OS V2.05.
              ----------------------------------------------@{fg text}

 Create Set-Up GEVs V2.01 (CSG) is a program that will be of use to anyone
 wanting to check up on certain amiga Set-Up specifications. CSG creates
 Global Enviroment Variables (GEVs) which are put into your ENV: drawer
 (usually in - RAM:Env).

@{fg fill} Technical:  GEVs, put simply, are just files with text in them.
             The filename is the Variable and the text is the variable's
             Value.@{fg text}

 The created GEVs so far include:

 * Kickstart Version and Revision numbers.

 * Active Information (Are IPrefs, WB, RAD and ConClip active?).

 * Boot-Menu/General Information (What Chip-Mode is the Amiga in? What Chips
   are installed? What Mode is the TV/Monitor in? etc).

 * Most, if not all, of the internal Device and Library Version and Revision
   numbers.

 * Disk Drives Information (Is DF0: DF1: DF2: DF3: connected? What are their
   Filenames, How many KB/Bytes are available on a disk, etc).

 * Memory Information (How much FAST, CHIP or ANY memory is available).

 * Printer Information (Is a parallel Printer connected? If so, is it ready
   for use?).

@node Starting "Getting Started"

@{fg shine} From the Startup-Sequence@{fg text}

 Put CSG into the C drawer, of the floppy disk or hard drive you are going
 to boot with. To run CSG simply re-boot your amiga. If you try and boot
 from a floppy drive when you have an hard drive the hard drive will have
 priority over the floppy drive. If you only have floppy drives or only have
 a hard drive then CSG will boot as normal. You can use the CLI Arguments if
 you you want more GEVs than the standard GEVs.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From CLI@{fg text}

 Put CSG anywhere you please. In your C drawer, Tools drawer or where ever.
 Start a CLI Process (I.e. use CLI, Shell or Workbench's `Execute' menu)
 and type the pathname for CSG (I.e. CSG, DF1:Tools/CSG, etc) and then press
 ENTER. This will give you the basic GEVs. Alternatively. Type the pathname
 for CSG followed by one or more CLI Arguments and then press ENTER.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From Workbench@{fg text}

 Make sure there is a TOOL Icon on CSG and then Double-Click on CSG.
 CSG will then read that Icon for CSG ToolTypes. If it finds any it will
 give you the appropriate GEVs.

@node Arguments "CLI Arguments"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of CSG CLI Keywords with their Arguments. CSG will not
 interpret an argument if its keyword is missing. I.e. You cannot just type
 the argument ALL without typing the keyword LIBRARIES for example as other
 keywords might use an ALL argument. Thus, CSG would have an hard time
 differentiating everything.

 You can use more than one keyword/argument set. Example:

 LIBRARIES ALL DEVICES REVISIONS DF1INFO YES

 You cannot however use the same keyword twice without loading CSG twice.
 For example. You cannot type: LIBRARIES VERSIONS LIBRARIES REVISIONS. Well
 I suppose you could but CSG will only do one check. In the above example
 LIBRARIES REVISIONS would cancel out LIBRARIES VERSIONS.

 All keywords and arguments must be in UPPERCASE. To avoid bulky code I did
 not turn any lowercased keywords/arguments into uppercase.

@{fg fill} The amiga uses a floppy disk drive that can format (blank) a disk to a
 capacity of 880 KiloBytes (1024 Characters times 880). The amiga uses 2
 types of Disk Format. OFS (Old Filing System) and FFS (Fast Filing System).
 OFS is used as the standard disk format because it keeps Disk and Data
 Information on a disk. FFS is similar to OFS but it keeps the Disk
 Information to the bare essentials so that you can format more of a disk.
 An OFS formatted disk will give you approximately 837 KiloBytes of disk
 space whereas an FFS formatted disk will give you approximately 880 Kilo-
 Bytes of disk space. Although FFS sounds better you have to watch for
 incompatiblities between amigas. For example, the Amiga A500 is an OFS type
 of amiga. So it is no good giving an A500 user an FFS formatted disk.
 However, because OFS is standard, you can give an FFS (A600, A1200, etc)
 user an OFS formatted disk.@{fg text}

 * CSG is now in assembly, thus, about 42k less than ASE V1.00 (the Amiga E
   version of this program). It is also faster.

   You can find ASE V1.00 on my `RadPrefs' disk which is in most, if not
   all, of the well known P.D Libraries, etc.

 * You no longer have to check if DF? exists before getting DF? Information.
@endnode

@node Information "Miscellaneous Information"

 * If you are an A600 user or a person wanting to check for the presence of
   an A600 I recommend that you check the Kickstart GEVs first and then use
   ASE V1.00 if an A600 is detected. Also. Try and use A600 C commands where
   possible as there are some A1200 C commands that are not compatiable with
   the A600.

 * If you try and get Information about DF0: when DF0: has been disabled via
   the Boot-Menu you will still get the following GEVs:

   DF0Empty YES, DF0MotorStatus OFF, DF0SizeType 3½ INCHES and
   DF0MediaSwaps 0001

 The above is not true for DF1: DF2: and DF3:. External Drives will not open
 the Trackdisk Device. Thus, no Information. So check a drives DF?Connected
 GEV first, unless you are absolutely sure the amiga you are using CSG with
 has that particular drive connected of course.

 * You will not get the RamDrive (RAD:) Version and Revision numbers if
   RAD0 is not mounted. This is the Correct way of doing things. The
   ramdrive.device will not open if Rad0 is not mounted simply because
   the amiga is not going to allow you access to an unopened device.
   Other programs probably use the DevList or something to get the RamDrive
   numbers. In any case, check the GEV RADActive to see if RAD0 is active.
   Another reason for doing things the correct way is that CSG might use
   RemRad() routines in the future.

 * RAM_0:, once mounted (activated), cannot be removed with RemRad and then
   re-mounted with Mount RAD: - from WorkBench. I have not tested for this
   in a startup-sequence or CLI. The Amiga does not allow this because the
   RemRad command does not actually dis-mount the RAD:. It only disables it.
   If you try and Mount RAD: again you will get the error message
   "ERROR: Device `Rad:' is already mounted".

   If you disable RAD: from the Boot-Menu it is also only disabled but not
   dis-mounted. So if you Mount RAD: (from your startup-sequence) for a
   second time (after a re-boot) you can get a message like
   "C drawer already exists on RAD:". You would get this message because
   you may of thought the disabled RAD: deletes all its files/directories.
   Wrong! The disabled RAD: has only been disabled - The files/directories
   are not deleted. Thus, you get your old RAD: back. The CSG example
   startup-sequence detects RAD: and shows how to test for existing files/
   directories, etc.

 These GEVs tell you the Version and Revision numbers of the Amiga you are
 using.

 The Version number usually tells you what Amiga is being used. For example.
 Version 37 is Operating System 2.0 which is normally used by the A500+ and
 A600. Whereas Version 39 is Operating System 3.0 which is normally used by
 the A1200. There are other versions such as Version 40 which is Operating
 System 3.1.

 The Revision number usually tells you what Software/Hardware is being used.
 For example. Revision 299 of the A600 has HD problems/bugs whereas Revision
 300 does not. Thus. You would know to avoid issuing HD Commands etc to an
 Amiga with KickStart V37.299.

 I said Usually/Normally above as it is possible to get an older Amiga, such
 as an A500, and update/change its Software/Hardware. So you may think, by
 checking the KickStart Version and Revision numbers only, that the Amiga
 being checked is an A600 for example when really it is an A500. Hence the
 reason for a program like CSG, where you can check various aspects of an
 Amiga set-up.

  GEV/File Name  -  KickstartVer

    Description  -  Tells you Version number of the Kickstart Library. Use
                    this to find out the Amiga Version (I.e. V37 (A600), V39
                    (A1200) etc).

 GEV/File Value  -  A 4 digit number. The number will be zeroed if it is not
                    four numbers long. For example. 39 will be 0039.


  GEV/File Name  -  KickstartRev

    Description  -  Tells you the Revision number of the Kickstart Library.
                    The revision number tells you something about the
                    Amiga's last update. For example. The Amiga A600, which
                    is Version 37, has two major revision numbers. 299 and
                    300. Revision 299 has HardDrive problems (You cannot use
                    an HardDrive properly). The A600 was updated, with the
                    HardDrive problems fixed, to revision 300. So, ideally,
                    KickstartRev could be used in your startup-sequence for
                    example to check for the HardDrive problem.

 GEV/File Value  -  A 4 digit number. The number will be zeroed if it is not
                    four numbers long. For example. 300 will be 0300.

  GEV/File Name  -  VBlankFrequency

    Description  -  Tells you this amiga's Vertical Blank Frequency.

 GEV/File Value  -  50 HERTZ, 60 HERTZ or a Value.

                    If the value is not 50 (for PAL countries such as
                    Europe) or 60 (for NTSC coutries such as USA) you will
                    get the value that is set for this frequency.


  GEV/File Name  -  PowerSupplyFrequency

    Description  -  Tells you this amiga's Power Supply Frequency.

 GEV/File Value  -  50 HERTZ, 60 HERTZ or a Value.

  GEV/File Name  -  EClockFrequency

    Description  -  Tells you this amiga's EClock Frequency - This amiga's
                    CPU (Central Processor Unit) speed.

                    An average clock speed is approximately 7.09379 Mhz. This
                    type of clock speed is good for basic work, but if you
                    need to do Serious Graphic projects for example then you
                    should consider getting a better Amiga and/or some extra
                    Hardware and/or Software.

 GEV/File Value  -  7.09379 MHZ - PAL, 7.15909 MHZ - NTSC or ERROR.

                    If the value is not 7.09379 MHZ - PAL or 7.15909 - NTSC
                    you will get the ERROR text.

@node TVMode "TVMode"

 The TVMode GEVs tell you what modes your TV/Monitor are using or use as a
 default.

  GEV/File Name  -  DefaultTVMode

    Description  -  Tells you the Default Mode (PAL or NTSC) of the
                    TV/Monitor connected to this amiga. The default mode
                    is the mode built into this amiga's Hardware.

                    The PAL Signal is used mainly in Europe, etc whereas the
                    NTSC Signal is mainly used in America, etc. For precise
                    information on NTSC and PAL Countries I would recommend
                    reading a Video/Camcorder Magazine/Book.

                    The built-in tv signal can be changed via Preference
                    programs (Workbench 2 and above as far as I know).
                    However. Every time the Amiga is switched on it will
                    default to its built-in tv signal until the built-in tv
                    signal is changed, if it can be changed or if it has
                    been changed.

 GEV/File Value  -  NTSC, PAL or UNKNOWN.

                    68881 and/or 68882 CO Processors). Thus. The math
                    emulation code has not been loaded. So only the 68040
                    FPU Instructions are available.

                    EMULATION CODE means the math emulation code has been

@node Printer "Printer"

 The Printer GEV tells you wether or not a Printer is ready for use.
 There will probably be more printer GEVs in the future. For example.
 PrinterColour to see if a printer is a Colour printer.

  GEV/File Name  -  ParallelStatus

    Description  -  Tells you if a Parallel Printer is ready for use.

                    Note: Ready for use. Not ON-Line. Older programs, and
                          some New ones, tend to term a printer that is
                          ready for use as ON-Line, which is incorrect.
                          A printer that is on-line is a printer with its
                          on-line switch turned on. But even with this
                          turned on, the Paper could still be out, the
                          printer could be Busy, etc. Hence. Ready for use
                          really has to be ready for use - Paper In,
                          Parallel Port not busy and the ON-Line switch
                          turned on. CSG checks for all of these.

 GEV/File Value  -  ON-LINE

                    The printer is connected and switched on.

                    OFF-LINE

                    The printer could be connected, but don't know for sure
                    as the printer is switched off.

                    PAPER OUT

                    The printer is connected and switched on, but there is
                    no paper in the machine.

                    BUSY

                    The Printer.Device/Parallel Port is busy, etc. Perhaps
                    printing something else? (or a program crashed with its
                    printer and has thus locked-up (crashed) the printer
                    port).

  GEV/File Name  -  FreeFastMemory

    Description  -  Tells you the amount of available (free) Fast Memory, in
                    Bytes.

                    FAST RAM is the amigas alternative type of RAM. Its main
                    use is for Data storage, although it can be used for
                    Graphic purposes aswell. It is ideal for Databases, Text
                    Editors, etc as these types of program normally use FAST
                    RAM instead of CHIP RAM wherever possible. Thus,
                    allowing CHIP RAM to give full attention to Graphic

@node DDInformation "Drive/Disk Information"

 These GEVs tell you about the disk drive and the disk in that drive.

@{fg fill} Although the hardware should be a 3½ Disk Drive and the software a Floppy
 Disk, do not assume this to be the case. Hence why I have used GEV names
 like Media, instead of Disk, for example.

 The above is especially true as the amiga can be configured in many ways.
 For example. I suppose if DF1: is not mounted then you could mount PC1:
 as DF1: or have completely different hardware plugged into the Disk Drive
 slot? Remember. DF0: DF1: DF2: and DF3: are just Mount names.@{fg text}

                    know if the inserted media is the first (boot)
                    insertion.

 GEV/File Value  -  A 4 digit number. The number will be zeroed if it is
                    not four numbers long. For example. 39 will be 0039.


  GEV/File Name  -  DF0Empty

    Description  -  Is the media's hardware empty? Good for checking if DF1:

                    Do not worry too much about the other types. Some of the
                    types are for other applications, but I checked them
                    anyway as my check routine is also used by other parts
                    of CSG. Plus it is best to be safe than sorry!


  GEV/File Name  -  DF0MediaName

    Description  -  The Name of the media.

 GEV/File Value  -  The Name of the media.


  GEV/File Name  -  DF0HeadsTest

                    NDOS or NO DISK.

                    You will more than likely see one of the OFS or FFS
                    names, as a media of format NDOS for example usually
                    gets handled by Dos (I.e. Dos will complain the media
                    is NDOS before CSG could read the disk anyway).

                    or UNKNOWN


  GEV/File Name  -  DF0MediaMode

    Description  -  Tells you wether the media is in Readable/Writeable,
                    Readable Only or Validating mode. Ignore validating
                    mode. I doubt you would ever see this? The other two
                    relate to the DF0MediaProtected GEV.

 GEV/File Value  -  READABLE/WRITEABLE, READABLE ONLY, VALIDATING or UNKNOWN


  GEV/File Name  -  DF0Cylinders, DF0CylSectors, DF0Heads, DF0MediaBlocks,
                    DF0MediaBlocksUsed, DF0MediaBytesPerBlock, DF0Sectors,
                    DF0TotalSectors and DF0Tracks.

    Description  -  The above GEVs relate to the media's hardware and are
                    really for programmers. They are used/combined to get
                    the KBCQ etc GEV Values.

 GEV/File Value  -  A 4 digit number. The number will be zeroed if it is
                    not four numbers long. For example. 39 will be 0039.


 NOTE: DF0 on the GEV/File Names will be changed to DF1, DF2 etc depending
       on the drive information you are requesting.
