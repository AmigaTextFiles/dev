            Speak To Me V3.00 - By: John White - Shareware (£2.50).
           ---------------------------------------------------------

@{fg text}
 Speak To Me (STM) V3.00 is a Speech program that allows you to use most, if
 not all, of the Amiga speech functions. It is meant as a replacement SAY
 program with Speech/Language program developers in mind.

 STM needs at least Operating System 39, the Narrator.Device (V39+) and
 the Translator.Library (V37+) to work. If you are going to use the LOAD
 and SAVE Config File options you will also need the ASL.Library (V39+).

 General Notes@{fg text}

 * White Edge/Black Box gadgets are all Number string gadgets, except for
   the Voice, Language Text and Phonetic Text gadgets which are Text string
   gadgets. If you enter a number that is out of range you will get the
   default value for that particular number string gadget.

   Note: You do not have to enter 3 numbers, for example, when you only need
         to enter 2 numbers (I.e you can enter 023 or simply 23). However.
         As my string update routine does not filter out leading zeros, when
         you first load STM or a Config file the numbers will appear as 023
         for example and not as 23. For now, I would stick to using 3 digits
         instead of 2 digits.

 * Black Edge/White Box items have a direct purpose. To show text. When you
   click on their associated Button gadgets they cycle through their partic-
   ular text items.

 * Most functions can use a Keyboard Key, aswell Mouse_Key/s, and are high-
   lighted with a Black character. Here is a list of those keyboard keys
   NOT highlighted with a Black character:

   F1-F3   (with/out Left-Shift)  -  Amplify Buttons

   F4-F6   (with/out Left-Shift)  -  Echo Buttons

   F7-F10  (with/out Left-Shift)  -  Audio Channel Values

@node Starting "Getting Started"

@{fg shine} From the Startup-Sequence@{fg text}

 Put STM into the C drawer, of the floppy disk or hard drive you are going
 to boot with. To run STM simply re-boot your amiga. If you try and boot
 from a floppy drive when you have an hard drive the hard drive will have
 priority over the floppy drive. If you only have floppy drives or only have
 a hard drive then STM will boot as normal.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From CLI@{fg text}

 Put STM anywhere you please. In your C drawer, Tools drawer or where ever.
 Start a CLI Process (I.e. use CLI, Shell or Workbench's `Execute' menu)
 and type the pathname for STM (I.e. DF1:Tools/STM, STM, etc) and then press
 ENTER. This will run STM. Alternatively. Type the pathname for STM followed
 by one or more CLI Arguments and then press ENTER.

 @{" CLI Arguments " Link "Arguments"}

@{fg shine} From Workbench@{fg text}

 Make sure there is a TOOL Icon on STM and then double-click on STM. This
 will run STM, which will then read the TOOL Icon for STM ToolTypes. If it
 finds any it will set the appropriate values inside STM.

@node Arguments "CLI Arguments"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of STM CLI Keywords with their Arguments. STM will not
 interpret an argument if its keyword is missing. I.e. You cannot just type
 the argument 0100 without typing the keyword SPEECH_PRIORITY for example as
 other keywords might use a 0100 argument. Thus, STM would have an hard time
 differentiating everything.

 You can use more than one keyword/argument set. Example:

 STM SPEECH_PRIORITY 0100 CONSOLE_PAUSETIME 0100

 Keywords and Arguments must be UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing in
 uppercase STM does not get clogged up with conversion code, opening of the
 Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} CLI Arguments@{fg text}

 SPEECH_PRIORITY Number

 The number can be from 0 upto 255. The default is 100. Using an high number
 (past 100) means most programs will get locked out (will not run) whilst
 your speech is being spoken. Whereas a low number (under 100) means Audio
 breaks might occur in your speech.

 CONSOLE_PAUSETIME Number

 The number can be from 0 upto 900. The default is 100. When the console
 window is used to show you the Mouth Information it needs to know how long
 to pause for. Hence PAUSETIME.
@{fg fill}
 Default values are used when a Keyword/Argument is not used/entered.@{fg fill}
@endnode

@node ToolTypes "WorkBench ToolTypes"

@{fg fill} Below is a list of STM WB ToolTypes with their Arguments. STM will not
 interpret an argument if its tooltype is missing. I.e. You cannot just use
 the argument 0100 without using the tooltype SPEECH_PRIORITY for example as
 other tooltypes might use a 0100 argument. Thus, STM would have an hard
 time differentiating everything.

 Tooltypes and Arguments must be in UPPERCASE. As a result of you Typing in
 uppercase STM does not get clogged up with conversion code, opening of the
 Utility.Library, etc.

@{fg shine} WB ToolTypes@{fg text}

 SPEECH_PRIORITY=Number

 The number can be from 0 upto 255. The default is 100. Using an high number
 (past 100) means most programs will get locked out (will not run) whilst
 your speech is being spoken. Whereas a low number (under 100) means Audio
 breaks might occur in your speech.

 CONSOLE_PAUSETIME=Number

 The number can be from 0 upto 900. The default is 100. When the console
 window is used to show you the Mouth Information it needs to know how long
 to pause for. Hence PAUSETIME.

@node Funcs "Functions"

@{fg shine}         SEX@{fg text}  Male or Female Voice.@{fg fill}

              This function only tells the Amiga to change certain parts
              of the voice - You must still change the PITCH and RATE of
              the voice to get the correct sounding Sex.@{fg text}
@{fg shine}
        MODE@{fg text}  Natural - Produces a Normal Pitch. This means Words/Sentences
                        are pronounced/said with Syllable Pronunciation,
                        Word Ending fade out, etc (As `We' `Normally' Speak,
                        in other words).

              Robotic - Produces a Monotone Pitch. This means Words/Sent-
                        ences are pronounced/said without changing the Tone
                        of the voice. So you get a Robotic sounding voice.

               Manual - Gives the user more (Manual) control over the voice.
                        This function is used with the Amiga's Accent
                        functions which in turn are used with the Amiga's
                        Mouth functions@{fg fill}

               Manual Mode turns off the above Natural Mode pronunciation
               routines, etc thus giving more voice control to the user.
@{fg shine}
      VOLUME@{fg text}  The Volume of the Voice. Range: 0 to 64.  Default Value: 64.
@{fg shine}
       PITCH@{fg text}  The Baseline Pitch of the Voice. Range: 65 to 320 Hertz.
              Default Value: 110.
@{fg shine}
        RATE@{fg text}  The rate, in Words Per Minute, at which the voice Speaks.
              Range: 40 to 400 Wpm. Default Value: 150.
@{fg shine}
   FREQUENCY@{fg text}  The Frequency of the Voice. Range: 5000 to 28000 Hertz.

              The Default is 22,200 Hertz. If you change this value you can
              create different Vocal effects. However, it is recommended
              that you leave the frequency at 22,200 Hertz and change the
              Echo Frequencies instead to get different Vocal effects.
@{fg shine}
       VOICE@{fg text}  STM allows you to define upto 10 Voices. Use this function to
              edit the voice's name. The new name will also be updated in
              menu. Use the menu options to select a Voice. The voice layout
              is meant for those people working on multi-language programs,
              so that they can easily switch between voices when testing a
              Sentence for example.
@{fg shine}
  ENTHUSIASM@{fg text}  The amount of Enthusiasm a voice has. Default Value is 32.

              This is really meant for use with Manual Mode above. It
              controls the scaling of Pitch Excursions used on Accented
              Syllables. A value of 33 or more gives more Enthusiasm and
              a value of 31 or less gives less Enthusiasm.
@{fg shine}
  ARTICULATE@{fg text}  Controls the Slur factor - It allows you to control the timing
              between each spoken word, etc. Default Value is 100%. A value
              of 101% or more will cause Slur sounding speech and a value of
              99% or less will cause Sharper, Deliberate sounding speech. If
              a value of Zero is given the Narrator.Device will take steps
              to create no timing at all.
@{fg shine}
     PERTURB@{fg text}  Controls the `Shakeyness' of the voice. None-Zero values cause
              a Shakey/Nervous type of voice (like an Old Person speaks for
              example) by randomizing the Pitch.  Range: 0 to 255.
@{fg shine}
      AVBIAS@{fg text}  Amplitude of Voicing - Controls the Amplitude of Un/Voiced
              Speech Sounds. Range: -32 to 31.
@{fg shine}
      AFBIAS@{fg text}  Amplitude of Frication - Controls the Amplitude of Un/Voiced
              Speech Sounds. Range: -32 to 31.

              BIAS Notes: Voiced Sounds are those made with the Vocal Cords
                          vibrating, such as vowels and some consonants like
                          y, r, w and m. Unvoiced Sounds are made without
                          vibrating vocal cords and instead are made with
                          turbulent air, such as s, t, sh and f. Some sounds
                          are a combination of both, such as z and v.
@{fg shine}
     AMPLIFY@{fg text}  Changes the 3 Amplitudies (Width/Size) of the Echo
              Frequencies, in Decibels. Thus, useful for creating different
              Tonal Balances (Bass or Treble). Range: -32 to 31. A value of
              -32 is equivalent to Infinity, shutting that Echo Frequency
              off completely.

              Note: Positive values may cause clipping.
@{fg shine}
       VOWEL@{fg text}  This is the Vowel that VOWEL.CENT, below, uses.

              Note: Use the Blank Vowel if you do not need the VOWEL.CENT
                    function.
@{fg shine}
 VOWEL CENT.@{fg text}  This is the degree of Vowel Centralization. This function
              interpolates towards the VOWEL sound, above. Misleads VOWEL,
              in other words, to make a user specified vowel sound. Thus,
              helping (with the other functions) to create a regional
              accent/dialect. Range: 0 to 100.

              Note: If you do not need this function remember to set the
                    VOWEL function to the Blank Vowel.
@{fg shine}
        ECHO@{fg text}  Changes the Tuning of the Echo Frequencies in the voice. There
              are 3 frequencies that you can change. Number One is the
              Lowest in frequency. Positive values raise the frequencies and
              Negative values lower the frequencies. Range: -32 to 31.
@{fg shine}
 A/C. CHANS?@{fg text}  Select the number of AUDIO CHANNELS you would like to use. You
              can use up to 4 channels.
@{fg shine}
  A/C. VALUE@{fg text}  Enter your Audio Channel Value for the currently selected
              (Grey Button) Audio Channel. Each audio channel is split into
              four sub-channels, as follows:

              Sub-Channel    1 (Right)    2 (Left)    3 (Left)    4 (Right)

              S/C Value           1           2           4            8


              To use an audio channel you simply supply A/C Value with one
              or more of the above S/C Values. So. To use audio channel 1
              with sub-channels 1 and 3 you enter 5 as the A/C Value. This
              is because you add each s/c value. To use audio channel 1 with
              sub-channels 2 and 3 you would enter 6 as the A/C Value. To
              use audio channel 1 with all the sub-channels you would enter
              15 as the A/C Value.

              You do the above for each audio channel you want to use. To
              get stereo sound you use all four audio channels with these
              respective A/C Values - 3, 5, 10 and 12.

              NOTE: You cannot use an audio channel on its own, except for
                    audio channel 1. For example. You cannot use audio
                    channel 3 on its own. The audio channel order is 1, 2,
                    3 and 4. If you are not Audio literate (like me) then
                    stick with using 4 audio channels with a/c values 3, 5,
                    10 and 12 (the Amiga defaults).
@{fg shine}
       SPEAK@{fg text}  Translates the current Language Text into Phonetic Text and
              then calls the SpeakToMe() routine. This acts like a `Repeat
              the Speech' function so that you can hear speech again and
              again without having to go via the Language Text (String)
              Gadget, below.
@{fg shine}
       SPEAK@{fg text}  Calls the SpeakToMe() routine. This acts like a `Repeat the
              Speech' function so that you can hear speech again and again
              without having to go via the Phonetic Text (String) Gadget,
              below.

 Language Text:

 1) Enter your Language Text in this String Gadget.

 2) When you have entered your Language Text either press the Return Key or
    simply Click anywhere outside of the string gadget (on a blank part of
    the Window for example).

    * If you press the Return Key your language text will automatically be
      translated into Phonetic Text and then spoken.

    * If you click anywhere outside of the string gadget your language text
      will not be translated or spoken. To have it translated and spoken
      simply re-click inside the string gadget and press the Return Key as
      above. Or click on the SPEAK button.

 Note: The Language Text string gadget has a length of 70 Characters.


 Phonetic Text:

 1) Enter your Phonetic Text in this String Gadget. Note: Phonetic Text uses
    UPPERCASE letters.

 2) When you have entered your Phonetic Text either press the Return Key or
    simply Click anywhere outside of the string gadget (on a blank part of
    the Window for example).

    * If you press the Return Key your phonetic text will automatically be
      be spoken. Note: The Amiga cannot translate phonetic text into
      language text.

    * If you click anywhere outside of the string gadget your phonetic text
      will not be spoken. To have it spoken simply re-click inside the
      string gadget and press the Return Key as above. Or click on the
      SPEAK button.

 Note: The Phonetic Text string gadget has a length of 140 Characters.

Info To File@{fg text}  If enabled the mouth details will be sent to a file called
              Ram:Mouth_Details.stm. Otherwise a Console Window will be used
              (See CONSOLE_PAUSETIME in WB ToolTypes/Cli Arguments).

              I have opted to give you the mouth details as Width and Height
              values rather than give you a mouth drawing of the width and
              height values. Simply because I believe the values are going
              to be of more importance, to an animator for example, than
              mouth drawings.

              To some extent Speech Synchronization is still basic and
              probably will not be of use to most people. The RKM Devices
              `3rd Edition' states, about the Narrator.Device:

              "A future version of the Device will include an extension to
               the Mouth_RB io request structure which will contain Word and
               Syllable counts and, possibly, other synchronization methods"

@node Tips "Speech Tips"

 This section contains my experiences of writing the LGUI Tagalog speech
 files (using the Translator.Library and Narrator.Device) which will
 hopefully give you more speech knowledge by way of hints/tips and
 information so that you might be able to create more precise
 pronunciation/speech for your own projects.
@{fg shine}
 Speech (Accent and Pronunciation)@{fg text}

 The Amiga, by default, is American. Regardless what language you ask the
 Amiga to speak it will always speak that language in an American way, due
 to its american Pronunciation, etc. For example. Even if you were to 
 fine-tune the Amiga to a near perfect Spanish Accent, at the end of the day
 a spanish sentence would be spoken in a spanish accent but the
 pronunciation of some words might not be pronounced properly.

 Saying the above, do not let this put you off. The Amiga is capable of
 pronouncing many words (I would not put an exact figure on it but the
 TAGALOG (Philippines) language for my LGUI program is about 95% accurate
 in speech/pronunciation). All the above is trying to point out is that at
 best you will more than likely have an American-Spanish voice for example
 as opposed to a 100% perfect Spanish voice. And that maybe now and again
 you will come up with a word that the Amiga cannot pronounce 100%
 perfectly. But look at it this way - Can you speak/pronounce every
 syllable/word of your language 100% perfectly?!
@{fg shine}
 Translator.Library (Language Text)@{fg text}

 The Translator.Library has one function, which is to translate Language
 Text (I.e. English, Spanish or whatever) into Phonetic Text. Phonetic Text
 is explained later, so for now just concentrate on Language Text.

 Language Text is normally for words that you can simply type into the Amiga
 and have them spoken without any worry/ies of Pronunciation, Stress, etc.
 Language Text falls into two categories. One is: Spell and Speak the same.
 For example. The word `Hello' is spelt Hello and spoken Hello. And two is:
 Spell and Speak differently. For example. The word `Flower' is spelt Flower
 but spoken something like Floora. So in this case you spell differently
 (I.e. Flouwer) in order to speak differently (I.e. Flou Wer). Normally your
 word/s will fall into category one. It is only when you come across a word
 like Flower or a Foreign word that that word may fall into category two.
 Category two is a case of Trial and Error. For example. With the word
 Flower do you spell Flouwer, Flou Wer or Flouw Er? They might get spoken
 differently from one another. Also. With category two wording a word may
 need to be syllablised, as with Flou Wer, in order to get more precise
 pronunciation. In general, with English, the Amiga will probably be near
 perfect without too much word syllablisation. However. With foreign words
 you are more than likely going to have to syllablise your words, to get
 maximum pronunciation.
@{fg shine}
 Syllablisation@{fg text}

 Here are some methods I have used to get better pronunciation of a word or
 sentence.

 * If you need a word to be Syllablised but at the same time kept whole
   you could try adding an extra E or O to the word's ending, changing an
   E to Ee or an O or U to Oo, etc.

   Example TAGALOG word: Marumi (Mah Ru Me).

     Mah Ru Me - Good, but a bit too slow/syllablised in sound. Also. If you
                 put the word as an whole (MahRuMe) it does not give the
                 correct word sound.

   Mah Roo Mee - Great! By changing `Ru' to `Roo' and `Me' to `Mee' you get
                 the correct syllablised sound. Also. If you put the word as
                 an whole (MahRooMee) you get the correct word sound aswell.
                 If you put MahRooMe you will not get the correct word
                 sound. So as you can see an E or OO, etc in the right place
                 works wonders!

 * If you find the word OR sounds a bit flat, you could try Oar.

 * Tie or Tigh?

        Example TAGALOG word: Hintay (Hin Tie or Hin Tigh).

        Tie and Tigh are the same, except Tigh gives a stress level of 3
        whereas Tie gives a stress level of 4.

 * Ee or Eeee?

        Example TAGALOG word: Kita (Kee Tah).

        If you need a word stretching you could try adding to more Es. For
        example. `Kee Tah' and `Keeee Tah' will give you two different
        sounds.

 * s  - To get rid of a Z sound try adding another S.

        Example word: Los Angeles.

        Los sounds like Loz, whereas Loss will sound like Los. Angeles would
        need to be changed to Anjeless.

 * h  - Might make a word more definate/stressed.

        Example TAGALOG word: Kaibigan (Kah E Big An).

        Adding an H to `An', of Kah E Big An, gives a more definate/stressed
        `Ahn' sound. H is quite flexible and can be used in varied ways to
        give a word definition/stress. An example of this was with `An'
        becoming `Ahn'.

 * A or Ah?

        To give a word like MA an apple (Ah) sound you would change MA into
        MAH. The H changes the sound of the vowel in this case and not the
        stress level as you might of thought (as with, *h, above).

 * e  - Might add extra Stress to a word ending in E.

        Example TAGALOG word: Bili (Be Le).

        Adding another E to an end word with an E already on it does not,
        usually, add any extra stress to that end word. For example. `Be Le'
        and `Be Lee' are the same because no extra stress is added to `Le'.
        However. Adding another E to a non-end word with an E already on it
        might add extra stress to that non-end word. For example. When
        `Be Le' becomes `Bee Le' extra stress is added to `Bee'.

 * ih - Might slightly soften a word ending in E.

        Example TAGALOG word: Nakabili (Nah Ka Billy).

        To get the word in syllable form, but at the same time keeping the
        word sounding whole, you could use:

         Naka Be Le - The trouble with this is that `Be' sounds too
                      definate. I.e. Naka BE Lee.

        Naka Bee Le - The trouble with this is that `Bee' sounds over
                      stressed.

        Naka Bih Le - This is the correct sound. By softening `Be' to `Bih'
                      you get a more natural sound.

 Narrator.Device (Phonetic Text)@{fg text}

 Phonetic Text is the code, which is made up of Phonemes, that is used by
 the Narrator.Device. Language Text gives roughly the same speech as
 Phonetic Text, but where they differ is in the control of speech. In
 particular, the Stress levels. With Language Text you are relying on the
 translator library's Translate() function to make your speech for you. So
 naturally the Stress levels are controlled by the Translate() function.
 With Phonetic Text however you have direct control of the Stress levels
 within your speech. To some degree you can alter a word/s in Language Text
 to adjust the Stress level/s, Tigh and Tie for example, but nothing beats
 direct control.

 You do not need the Translator.Library if you are to use Phonetic Text only
 (you will only need the Narrator.Device). However. If you are to use
 Language Text you will need both the Translator.Library and the Narrator-
 .Device. Do not worry too much about this though as the speech program you
 use should give you all the information you need about needed files, etc.

 Stress Levels@{fg text}

 Stress levels are used to Stress a word in a certain way. Sometimes to
 hightlight a word or sometimes just to make a pronunciation sound right.
 Here are the stress levels and their recommended use.

 9 - Use for Exclamations.

 7 - Use for Adverbs and Quantifiers.

 5 - Use for Nouns and Adjectives.

 4 - Use for Verbs.

 3 - Use for Pronouns.

 2 - Use for secondary stress in Polysyllabic words, and no stress for
     Articles, Prepositions and Conjunctions.

 1 - Use for secondary stress in Polysyllabic words, and no stress for
     Articles, Prepositions and Conjunctions.

 0 - Use for everything else.

 When using Stress Levels it is usually a case of Experimentation. In some
 cases you may not notice the diference between level 4 and level 5 for
 example. You might, for example, need to try level 6 in these cases to
 notice the difference.

 In addition to stress levels are some special codes.

 . - A full stop at the end of a sentence should cause a slight drop in
     Pitch whilst allowing the end of the sentence to be spoken/heard
     clearly (as opposed to a natural fade-out of the end of the sentence).

 ? - A question mark at the end of a sentence should cause a slight rise
     in Pitch whilst allowing the end of the sentence to be spoken/heard
     clearly (as opposed to a natural fade-out of the end of the sentence).

 , - A comma will cause a pause in a sentence, wherever you have inserted
     a comma.

 --  A pair of dashes should cause a phrase to drop in Pitch very slightly.
     The phrase must be enclosed in dashes. For example:

     this sentence should - drop in pitch very slightly - You know

 ()  Noun Phrase delimiter.

 Note: You may have noticed that I put `Will' and `Should' in the above
       descriptions. Where I have put `Should' means that when I tested the
       codes the difference they made to a sentence was not heard/noticed
       and/or did not have the out-come I would of expected.

 Phonemes@{fg text}

 As said above, Phonetic Text is made up of Phonemes. Phonemes are the Vowel
 and Consonant sounds, etc needed to produce Amiga speech. For example. The
 Language Text sound MAH when translated to Phonetc Text is MAE4. MAE4 is
 using the Consonant Phoneme M, the Vowel Phoneme AE and Stress Level 4.

 Below is some information regarding Amiga sound using Phonetic sound.
 I have tested most of the sounds to give you some idea of what each sound
 will/can make. Those sounds I did not, or could not, test I have relied on
 various Amiga books to guide me.

 Please note. As I am not an expert in Amiga Speech I have had to rely on
 various Amiga books and my Ear to give the following information. Thus, it
 is up to you how you interpret the information, etc. The LGUI, TAGALOG,
 FSSpeech.Lgui file might also be of help/guidance to you?

 The next section covers Diphthongs, which are vowel sounds that change
 while they are pronounced. The word Boil is a good example. You start by
 pronouncing the letter O as a long vowel but end by pronouncing the letter
 I as a short vowel. The Amiga phoneme for this diphthong is OY.

 * MC68020 Assembly Code  - By converting STM V1.14 into Assembly code from
                            `Amiga E' code I was able to cut STMs size by
                            approximately 30k. I chose MC68020 code over
                            MC68000 code because of its better/faster
                            instructions, which means STM will only work on
                            OS3+ Amigas. Use STM V1.13 if you are using an
                            A600.

 * Better Strings         - STM now uses Intuition Strings with routines
                            that give each string its default value if an
                            incorrect value was entered for that string.

 * Smaller Window         - I put a couple of the old options onto the Menu.

 * Improved ASL Requester - You can now choose any drawername and filename.

                            AddPart() does not overwrite your original
                            buffer, if you keep using the same buffer, thus
                            you get a garbage buffer second time around, etc
                            I fixed this by allocating a new buffer each
                            time the ASL Requester is used and then make a
                            copy of the buffer's contents before
                            deallocating the buffer.

 * Editable Voice Names   - You can now edit the names of the ten voices.
