You can if you wish compile and run the test suite. As stated in the README.txt you will
require the Check package from http://check.sourceforge.net. This compiles easily to a static library it does however use fork() to run the actual tests to catch segfaults etc.
As you may be aware fork() cannot be implimented under AmigaOS (please don't ask me 
to explain) luckily it has a no fork mode. Either set the env variable CK_FORK to "no"
or run runtest with the --no-fork option. The only other useful option is --verbose BTW.

See the docs for Check and runtest.c for more information.
