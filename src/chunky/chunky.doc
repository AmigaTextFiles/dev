CHUNKY ROTATION DEMO, (c) 1994 RANULF DOSWELL.

Well here it is. The much eagerly awaited chunky rotation demo...

It seemed too much including both the executable file _and_ the source brush,
and so as the executable compressed to a smaller file than the source (it's
true!! ;) I have provided the utility to create data files...

The utility dump (and source dump.c) was modified from tmapdemo to output a
12-bit colour value for each pixel in the source bitmap, and this is what
you need for a picture.

Make a 256x256 pixel brush, and type "dump <brushname> pic" and then assemble
the source (RotatePicture.s) and marvel and the result.

I fyou use this then please credit me somewhere. I was going to use this in
an AGA megademo (and so not provide source to Internet) but I felt guitly, so
I gave in. Please do not take the credit for this work.

I am currently doing my A-level exams, and have no tru internet access of my
own, so it is hard to contact me by e-mail, so try s-mail instead. I will be
around comp.sys.amiga.programmer as from October 1994, so you can find me there!

My address is:
 Ranulf Doswell, 1 Ayr Street, Lancaster, Lancashire, LA1 3DT, England

If you _must_ use e-mail then write to my friend at csuoj@csv.warwick.ac.uk,
but please only write if absolutely required.

I am currently working on a Doom-type game (straight after my exams) so watch
out for this in late 1994. I have pretty much worked out in my head some ideas
to virtually eliminate all multiplications during screen update, so it should
be fast. Please provide any feedback with this idea, and also for this demo.

If you have a machine other than a base (unexpanded) 1200 (like me:( then
please tell me what screen-sizes you can run at and still get 25fps (for the
doom conversion...)

Idea was originally based upon chopper code (COPASM.A) by Patrick van Logchem
which reminded me of an idea I had once, but forgot all about until now...

I have tried fiddling with HTOTAL as suggested on c.s.a.p, but I have found
that it doesn't work with TV's (like mine...sobsob) and so I haven't used that
speedup. Please don't use it - it'll alienate your target audience...
