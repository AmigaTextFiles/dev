This is, as its names says it, another readme file.

You can try to run kaliosys by double-clicking on the "Couin" icon.
You can leave by hitting the joystick button.
Hit the space bar or the middle mouse button to show/hide the gui. It is
expected to become the map-editor, and a game-creating panacea tool.

For programmers, here is a short description of what each sources does:

COUIN.s - This is the main source. Here all the other sources are included.
          It assembles well with PhxAss 4.36.

Init.s  - This is the initialisation and bitmap-allocation routine.

Main.s  - This is the main program, and probably the corest source of the
          program, because it contains almost all of the tests.

Support.s   - It contains the routines for blitter, garden dwarves, etc.

Support.i   - Some interesting stuff for Support.s

Playfield.s - Here are all the routines for scrolling, bobs, and triple
              buffering.

Playfield.i - Some structures and equates for Playfield.s

Gui.s   - This contains the routines for the gui.

Gui.i   - Some things for Gui.s

Copper.s    - The fantastic routine to glue many pieces of copper lists
              together (a kind of own custom BUG-FREE MrgCop() :)

Copper.i    - Some things for Copper.s

CopIns.i    - Some macros for copper instructions.

BSS.s       - Some BSSs sections

ChipDats.s  - Some chip datas

Scrolls.s   - For now it contains only the routine for background scrolling.

Ripolin.s   - That deals with the ugly ripolin generation.

ScreenSwitch.s - Here is some routine to remove and unremove the couin
                 screen.

Iconify.s   - It is the routine that opens and close the iconify window.

AutoCrop.s  - It is the routine that crops the sprites for things and all.

MapEditor.s - A partial implementation of the map editor.

GuiSupport.s - For now, it contains the file requester, and the out of mem
               routine.

GuiSupport.i - Include file for GuiSupport.s

OO.s - The object oriented handling routines

OO.i - Definitions and a ton of macros for OO.s

Editor.s - The text editor engine, the text editor class and the console
           class

Editor.i - Definitions of a lot of things for Editor.s

Test.s  - It contains some ugly test things, the debug menu, etc.

BumpGlobalRev - This is a script to bump the revision number of KQ

Couin.descr - An obsolete file that roughly describes the data formats used
              by couin (I'll delete it one day...)
