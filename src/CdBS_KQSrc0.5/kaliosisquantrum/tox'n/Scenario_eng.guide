This suppose the Original @{i}Living Star@{ui} context to be known as I know it. Sylve
and I decided to drive @{i}Kaliosis@{ui} a little away from Living star's story. Maybe
Kaliosis will have some effects on @{i}Living star@{ui}.

The total @{i}living star@{ui} scenario is being written by Sylve at this time.

The story take place in a world constituted by many planets. Not all will  be
visited during the game (we'll keep some for next sequels).
