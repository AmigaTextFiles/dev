  These are the sources of a tool called EMOG which may be used
  to convert a C header to an E source . I've mailed this tool
  at the Amiga-E mailinglist but the response wasn't that big
  so I won't continue this program as there seems to be no
  interests . If anyone wants to complete this proggy feel
  free to do so. I would continue it if there is enough
  resonance but I don't believe in this.


  COMPILING

  If you want to compile this you need to have the E compiler
  plus the GeekGadgets stuff. Changing the directory to the
  place where the sources are located and typing "makeall MAKE"
  will generate the binary. "makeall -?" gives you a small
  description of the options.


  PROBLEMS

  The C header file must contain valid ANSI-C code because
  I'm not checking for errors. I assume the following things
  about the C header file:

    1. No empty macros. "#define MYMACRO" must be replaced
       by "#define MYMACRO 1" . The value 1 isn't needed.
       Any other expression is valid, too but why using
       something more complicated.

    2. Structure definitions containing something like
       this:

	    struct mystruct {

	      struct {
		int x, y;
	      } thiscomponent;

	    };

       aren't valid. Instead the declaration should be
       changed to following:

	  struct point {
	    int      x, y;
	  };

	  struct mystruct {
	    point    thiscomponent;
	  };



    3. Macros with args aren't supported.

    4. Casting in macros will not be converted successfully.



  TODO

  Module loading (lomo.e) for setting up a table of identifiers
  which may be used to use proper identifier names .
