Type:         dev/src
Version:      1.1
Requires:     OS3,OS4,morphos
Architecture: ppc-amigaos,m68k-amigaos


VERSION
V1.1 :
OS4 build is correct this time 
Morphos port (Stefan A. Haubenthal)
No more use 100% cpu

DESCRIPTION 
ObjDumpFuncs: obtain functions from Objdump tool (or Adis)
Works only on binary with symbols and name (non stripped binaries)
Disassemble a program and show functions usage
Build a list of functions from assembly source
then can sort them per size/offset/name/stack usage/etc..
can follow a function : what functions call this function, what functions are called

So this program allow to understand how a binary works : what call what
So this is a kind of dynamic functions tree
This program is especially usefull for (porting) a big program with sources that you can
recompile (not stripped) that you want to understand how it works

The OS3 version ObjDumpFuncs use Adis as disassembler for 68k code
The OS4 version ObjDumpFuncs-ppc use Objdump as disassembler for PPC code

If you still dont understand what do this program then just try :
Start ObjDumpFuncs. Choose ObjDumpFuncs as binary for analyzing


Use 'q' for quitting
										
WARNING: This program crash on exit and I dont know why
