Excption's purpose is to provide a programmer with routines to handle
error conditions.  Exception handling helps to solve difficult error
handling conditions such as No more memory, file not open, read/write
error....  Excption makes usage of traps very easy from C, since no
assembly code is required.

These routines are very different from the GOMF software.  You may
have as many "protected code" zones in your program as you want, and
you dispose of a mean to propagate easily errors upward if you cannot
fix the problem at a low level (usually the case for fwrites's).  In
any case, no actions are taken whatsoever, control is simply passed to
your local (context wise) handling routine.  Your task is not
suspended.  All your handling routines are in user mode with
multitasking enabled.
