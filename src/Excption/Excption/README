Please give feedbacks on the use of this codes: bugs, comments,
syntaxe usage,...

   To use this software, read the excption.man documentation first.
If you intend to program with it, consult both the examples provided:
essai.c and fact.c. Consulting excption.h is also neccessary for
good use. Only relevant data is in this file. excppriv.h is private
and should only be used by advanced C programmers wishing to change
the sources. Consulting the excption.doc documentation is also a good
idea, but I do not recommend using these function directly. This is
why they are prefixed with an EI.

   To compile essai and fact just do (with a lattice compiler 4.01 & +):

>lc essai.c
>blink with essai.lnk

>lc fact.c
>blink with fact.lnk

   Please report bugs and comments to the author:

### Version 0.5 / 880517

   The puts functions in EIRaise and EIBlow have been protected by an
#if DEBUG statements in order to not blow the amiga for programs with no
stderr open. Anyway these puts where used only in corrupted situations
and did not bother operation. If you want them back (for debug) just
recompile these two files with the DEBUG flag on.
   The exption.h file is moved in the local: directory, and the private
files are in the local:private directory.
   The excption.doc file was slightly improved. The exption.man file
is the same as for version 0.4

### Version 0.6 / 880705

   Added two functions in order to debug programs using this module
with an external debugger. All functions were recompiled using
the proto/exec.h file.
   The mentionned memory problems in version 0.5 never existed, just
that csh consumes/releases its memory in its history lists. Confusing!
Added Boolean.h in the arc file, this somehow got lost in version 0.5.
