This archive contains a LightWave scene converter that

could be used for games,demos etc.. It has too many features
to mention here but the result is one file containing objects,
motions,textures etc... The converter is developed by
Equalizer/The Black Lotus and was used in an engine made by
Offa/TBL in a demo called "Captured Dreams" (Wich can be find on aminet).
The converter is made for Amiga but can save all data in PC-byte order and
floats etc... You need to know alot about 3d-programming to make any use of
this archive, but if you're planning to make a complex 3d-engine i bet you
already do.. :)
  The converter is written in 100% ANSI-C and has been proven to work
on PC's, Amiga's , SGI's , Spark's etc... The source is not well documentet
ot structured.... :)
